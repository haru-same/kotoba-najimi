1
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,266
Excuse me.

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,734
{\an8}Uh, I was thinking
about having some coffee.

3
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,767
{\an8}Who else wants some?

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,567
OK. Got it.

5
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,467
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

6
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:43,266
Roast pork. I brought a whole one.

7
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,266
Wow!

8
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,600
I'll put it in your fridge.

9
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,667
RULES

10
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,033
Your room is really clean.

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,834
You can change in here,
but you sleep on the sofa.

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,200
I can sleep anywhere.

13
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:07,700
All the other stuff is on that paper.

14
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,867
Oh, you mean those rules on the fridge?

15
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,100
Yeah.

16
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,934
OK, I've got work now.

17
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,967
Don't pull any funny business.

18
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,166
-How boyfriend-like.
-Shut up.

19
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,834
Thanks for letting me stay.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,533
What's with you?

21
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,333
Oh, you're back.

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,367
I think Nao's still sleeping.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,700
Huh?

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,166
No need to rush home.
I'm not going to do anything to her.

25
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,700
Who said I was rushing?

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,200
<i>Evening Star special pork roast fried rice</i>

27
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,133
with wonton soup.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,834
-Wow!
-Nice!

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,934
Thanks.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,633
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

31
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,500
This is better than I can do.

32
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,667
I'll cook for you guys
while I'm staying here.

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,800
-Seriously?
-What?

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,500
Don't you dare tell my dad
where I'm at, Nao.

35
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:38,233
I won't.

36
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,734
This is delicious, Issei.

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
-Can I get seconds?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,433
Thanks.

39
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,567
You're used to this, aren't you?

40
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,233
Of course I am.

41
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,400
-Next one.
-Here.

42
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,133
-Here.
-I'm not ready yet.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,100
OK.

44
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,266
-Rinse it.
-Look what you did!

45
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,667
There's onion still--

46
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,300
You can take a bath now.

47
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,033
-Get to bed.
-Huh?

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,667
It's late.

49
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,400
No, it's not.

50
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,700
-Come on.
-I'm not sleepy either.

51
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:19,734
I said go to bed.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
-Why? It's not late.
-That doesn't matter. Get to bed.

53
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,767
I'm not sleepy at all. What're you doing?

54
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,867
-Do as I say. Get to bed.
-No way! I'm not going to bed!

55
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,433
Hey! What're you doing?

56
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,734
You can take a bath first.

57
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:38,467
Oh, OK. Thanks.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,467
<i>Time to get up!</i>

59
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,567
This is <i>way</i> better than I can do.

60
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Bon appétit.

61
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,233
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

62
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,367
That's hot!

63
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,367
This is great, Issei!

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,033
-Hey, Issei.
-Huh?

65
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,133
-You've got bad bed head.
-I do?

66
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,800
-Where's it funny?
-Right here.

67
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,133
-Turn that way.
-Where is it?

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,667
-I said turn that way.
-Ow! That hurt!

69
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:07,367
-I haven't even touched it.
-I'm done.

70
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:11,166
Huh? You're done eating already?
You usually have three bowls of rice.

71
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,867
It's time to go.

72
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:13,867
-Sorry.
-It's OK.

73
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:17,367
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

74
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,633
Forget about eating. Get going!

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,900
Hurry up! You'll be late!

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,533
-Leave some for me.
-OK.

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,567
Sorry, Issei.

78
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,233
-It's OK.
-See you later.

79
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,767
Nao, can you lend me your house key?

80
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,367
-My key?
-Yeah.

81
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,900
It's not safe to go out
without locking the door.

82
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,333
Oh, yeah. You're right.

83
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
OK.

84
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:03,800
Thanks.

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,133
Hey, wait for me!

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,433
-Bye! See you later.
-Bye.

87
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,166
Wait up for me, Uehara!

88
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,800
Uehara!

89
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,066
Wait for me, would you?

90
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:32,934
Yu!

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,734
Aren't you going to talk to him?

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Isn't that why you came?

93
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,667
It's OK. I'll come back again later.

94
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,800
Really? Issei?

95
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,033
Yeah. He and his dad had an argument.

96
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,834
But I'm partly to blame for it.

97
00:06:56,133 --> 00:07:01,834
Two handsome guys... under one roof.

98
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,433
Marina? Marina!

99
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,266
-Oh! I've got to go!
-Why? That's just the first bell.

100
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,767
Haven't you heard?
There's a university student here today.

101
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,633
-Really?
-Yes! A student teacher!

102
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,533
I've got to go check him out.

103
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:21,500
Has she forgotten that I'm her boyfriend?

104
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,266
I wouldn't worry about it.

105
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,533
I'm Senzaki Yu,
a senior from Joso University.

106
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,633
I'll be your teacher
for the next two weeks.

107
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,834
Yes! He's hot!

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,400
Excuse me!

109
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,266
Nao, my girl!

110
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,166
Don't talk like that to me!

111
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,667
You are a teacher, after all.

112
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,333
I'm so glad we could meet again, dear!

113
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,200
I told you, quit talking like that!

114
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,133
To be honest,
I came here so I could see you.

115
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,367
What?

116
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:01,333
Don't act so mean.
Let's try to get along, OK?

117
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
<i>-Nao!</i>
-Cut that out!

118
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,266
Uehara.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,033
Who's that?

120
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,300
He's the student teacher--

121
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,333
I know exactly who you are!

122
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,433
You're one of the top three
hottest boys in school.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,467
Top of the class! Sportsman!
An all-around awesome guy!

124
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,700
Twinkle, twinkle!

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,133
-Oh, he's not <i>that</i> great.
-Why are you all giggly?

126
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,100
Sorry.

127
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,300
So it's true. You two really are a couple.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,300
Such a pity!
I was so glad that I could see Nao again.

129
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:36,266
I'm Senzaki Yu. I'll be working here
for the next two weeks.

130
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,033
OK?

131
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,467
What the hell is up with that guy?

132
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,333
He was in the same hospital as me.

133
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:55,967
So that's why he said "again."
What an unfortunate coincidence.

134
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,500
I was shocked to see him too.

135
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,900
You didn't let slip about us to him,
did you?

136
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,166
What? Of course I didn't.

137
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:08,166
You know,
you've been acting strange lately.

138
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,800
You're angry all the time.

139
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:13,600
That's because
you're always letting your guard down.

140
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,767
Like this morning...

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,834
This morning?

142
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,734
Forget it.

143
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,934
<i>-Miso ramen up!
-OK!</i>

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,233
Here's your miso ramen. Enjoy!

145
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,300
-Excuse me!
-One moment, please.

146
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,500
Damn him!
Right when we're busy, too.

147
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,900
Sorry, Nao. You have to work double hard
because of that stupid son of mine.

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,900
Uhm, sir. About those bowls...

149
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:58,433
You see, it was me that broke them.

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,734
I ran into Issei
while he was making the delivery.

151
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,367
I'm very, very sorry.

152
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,600
Forget about it, Nao.

153
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,900
I already apologized to the customer.
It's taken care of.

154
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,033
But, didn't you have
an argument about that?

155
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:16,333
He told me
he wants to go learn somewhere else.

156
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,333
Really?

157
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,567
He's gotten too big for his britches,
saying he's leaving.

158
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:25,700
How can I let him work somewhere else
when he can't even do a proper job here?

159
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,934
He told me so suddenly
that I lost my temper and...

160
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,533
Good night.

161
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:41,967
Issei?

162
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,633
Hi. What a coincidence.

163
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:51,500
Yeah.

164
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,967
Was it busy?

165
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,967
-Why? Does it bother you?
-No.

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Really? Then I won't tell you.

167
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,367
Now you're acting like Uehara.

168
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,800
Really? You're kidding!

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,967
Like I said before, you'll become
more and more like each other.

170
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,734
Like a married couple.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,633
Oh, dear. Was I really being that mean?

172
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,033
Well, so I guess

173
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,233
your mom was a lot like your dad too, huh?

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,166
Not at all.

175
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,867
She was at the shop every day.

176
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:34,333
But she didn't smell of ramen.

177
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,300
She just had a nice smell.

178
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,700
So she ran the shop with him?

179
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,033
Yeah.

180
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,834
The three of us were always together,

181
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,834
so ever since I can remember,
I thought I'd inherit the shop.

182
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,100
But I want to make a name for myself.

183
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,667
Dad learned the business
at a lot of different shops.

184
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:10,734
I want to be like him
and learn from different people

185
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,467
so I can be deserving enough
to run Evening Star Ramen.

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,300
You can do it, Issei! I'm sure!

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,133
I'm on your side.

188
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:32,033
I'm sure your dad will understand
if you talk it over with him.

189
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,033
He'll never listen to me.
He's too stubborn.

190
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,700
Don't worry. He'll listen.

191
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:44,767
Yeah, right.

192
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,133
When you say "Don't worry,"
it actually makes me worry.

193
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,500
What?

194
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,533
I'm home.

195
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,633
Hi.

196
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,934
-We just happened to run into each other.
-I wasn't asking.

197
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,567
Hey. I'll take you on.

198
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,433
-Huh?
-Really?

199
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,767
I'm done! Yay!

200
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,500
You guys are pretty bad at this.

201
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,300
{\an8}20 MINUTES LATER

202
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,533
{\an8}You guys still aren't done?

203
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
{\an8}-Shut up.
-Shut up.

204
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,667
{\an8}30 MINUTES LATER

205
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,800
-Time out. I've got to go to the bathroom.
-OK.

206
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,166
She's a really nice girl.

207
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,500
Don't you ever make her cry.

208
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,800
-Uno!
-What?

209
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,200
Yes!

210
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,633
I lost!

211
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,834
You don't have to tell me that, you know.

212
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,700
Come on, Nao. Let's go.

213
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,300
Oh, sorry.

214
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm the class helper today,
and I have to clean up the chem lab.

215
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,734
Then I have to go straight to work.

216
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:45,967
OK, see you.

217
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,000
Bye.

218
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,700
Thank you for helping me, Abe.

219
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,100
No problem.
Today's an important day, after all.

220
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,734
Yeah. I appreciate it.

221
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,867
No problem. It's for Issei!

222
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,533
Yes! This is for him!

223
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,200
<i>There's a total babe at the school gate!</i>

224
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:32,633
<i>She's wearing a Seiran High uniform!</i>

225
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
<i>Holy cow! What a babe! She's totally hot!</i>

226
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:35,700
<i>Damn, she's sweet!</i>

227
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,433
Wow!

228
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:39,533
Oh!

229
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:41,967
What is it? Let me see.

230
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:43,734
-No, no, no!
-Huh?

231
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,333
You shouldn't look. She's incredibly ugly.
It'll hurt your eyes.

232
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Let's clean this place up.

233
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,500
When you say something like that,

234
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,767
-it makes me extra curious.
-No!

235
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,033
-Let me see.
-Seriously, don't.

236
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,033
-Let me see!
-No, don't.

237
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,133
Let me see! Hah! Got past you!

238
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,867
Huh? Who's that?

239
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:14,433
If my memory is correct,
she's the one who made the beef stew.

240
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,367
King of ladies?

241
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:19,900
Yes.

242
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,500
Oh, I know what this is!

243
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,300
They've got a class reunion.

244
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,967
I'm sure she's here about that.

245
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,333
Oh, is that why?

246
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,367
It's all right.

247
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:34,066
I told you before, she's got a boyfriend.

248
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,734
Oh, yeah.

249
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,533
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,433
<i>I didn't mean to bother you at school.</i>

251
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,567
But you never answer my texts.

252
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,300
It's the class reunion info.

253
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:02,800
Oh, yeah.

254
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,633
I'm going to my boyfriend's,
so we're headed in the same direction.

255
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:14,900
<i>Come on! Quit dragging your feet!</i>

256
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,133
-Pick up the speed.
-Yes, sir.

257
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,233
-Who's that?
-She's just an admirer.

258
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,533
It'll be fine. He'd never have anything
to do with her.

259
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,433
That Uehara sure is popular.

260
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,300
That's because he's perfect in every way.

261
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,033
-But he's got a girlfriend, right?
-Yeah. Nao.

262
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,567
But we haven't given up on him.

263
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,800
Yet they live together, right?

264
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,600
-Really?
-They do?

265
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,333
How about near the station?

266
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,166
-Are you on your way home, my dear?
-Good bye!

267
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:50,800
There's no need to rush off.
Your boyfriend seems busy anyway.

268
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,834
He's cheating on you.

269
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,900
No, he's not!

270
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,567
Yes, he is. Just now he was--

271
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,934
You're mistaken! That was just--

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,834
I'm not mistaken, I'm afraid.

273
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:08,567
-What?
-She's an old friend of mine.

274
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,934
She's Momoyama Mami
from Seiran High School.

275
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,967
Really?

276
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:17,000
She's been visiting Uehara's place.

277
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,600
And she says
she sees you around a lot too.

278
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,867
Nao's his girlfriend, so of course
she goes to his house sometimes.

279
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,100
Right?

280
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:31,867
You're living together!

281
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,133
At least that's what the rumors say.

282
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,066
Are they true?

283
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,266
No... No, they're not. That's crazy.

284
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,867
Even though you
and Mami are quite different,

285
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:50,967
he's two timing you.
A top three boy, but a typical male.

286
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,033
How can you say that?
You don't know anything about him.

287
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,967
I <i>do</i> know that he's a scumbag.

288
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:06,367
Nao!

289
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:32,834
I wonder... if he really knows...
that we're living together.

290
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,500
He's just taking a shot in the dark
because he heard that rumor.

291
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,100
Don't worry about it.

292
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,066
Yeah, you're right.

293
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,667
Anyway, we've got things to do for Issei!

294
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,200
Right?

295
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:58,567
Nao. Are you sure you're all right?

296
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,967
I'm fine. Just fine.

297
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,033
I'm fine.

298
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,166
Seems like you're faking it.

299
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,467
I'm just fine!

300
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:18,367
I trust in Uehara, so I'll be fine.

301
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,900
Are you sure it's not
"I want to trust him"?

302
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:34,934
Jeez, Abe! You sound like a therapist.

303
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,200
-But, Nao, you seem--
-I told you, I'm fine!

304
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,734
Let's stop talking about this.

305
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,133
Today's an important day, you know.

306
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,367
Thanks for helping me, Abe.

307
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,133

If only Issei were here.

321
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,934
Forget about him. He's no use to me.

322
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,867
How about I give him a call?

323
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,033
Don't!

Sorry.

344
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:10,700
Did you think I'd be forced to come back
if the shop got busy?

345
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:12,967
Good idea, huh?

346
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,133
Ow!

347
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,667
I'm the one who asked him to help.
I'm sorry about the trouble.

348
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:19,900
Nao.

349
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:20,967
Yes?

350
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,433
Thanks for worrying about us.

351
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,800
Yeah, I guess you're right.

352
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:29,100
Thanks to you, we know that this place is
in trouble without me.

353
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,734
-You're wrong.
-What?

354
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,633
I'm never giving this shop
to an irresponsible ass like you.

355
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,200
What?

356
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,667
Get some practice at a bigger shop.

357
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:46,066
If you don't,
I won't ever let you run the Evening Star.

358
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:49,800
Dad...

359
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,133
Manager...

360
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,567
It's just like you said.

361
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:57,266
It's probably important for you
to work on your own for a while.

362
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,200
Go ahead.

363
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,400
Why are you looking like that?

364
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:08,667
Since you were little,
you were always by my side.

365
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:11,066
You kept saying you'd take over after me.

366
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:15,000
It was like your life was mine.

367
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,200
But that's not right.

368
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm sorry about what I did.

369
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,967
Uhm...

370
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,700
I'm sorry for saying what I did too,

371
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,467
Dad.

372
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,266
-Thanks for today.
-No problem.

373
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,367
Nao, here.

374
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,667
I'll give it back to him.

375
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:01,233
I'll get my bag tomorrow.

376
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:04,400
OK. See you later.

377
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,767
Nao!

378
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,700
Uhm...

379
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:19,600
Yes?

380
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:33,300
Thanks.

381
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,967
-Bye.
-See you.

382
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,700
Hello?

383
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,967
<i>How come you haven't answered your phone?</i>

384
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,066
What's up?

385
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,467
<i>-I made too much again.
-Oh, but I, uh...</i>

386
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,367
Don't you like fried chicken?

387
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,367
-Yes, I do.
-Then here.

388
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,767
It'll just go to waste.

389
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,700
Actually, I made it for him.

390
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,066
But he said
he doesn't need dinner tonight.

391
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,367
OK, fine. Thanks.

392
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:32,967
No problem.

393
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,433
Oh. How's it going?

394
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,333
Nao?

395
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:02,967
Are you upset about something?

396
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,133
Don't tell me
you got food poisoning again.

397
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,500
Of course not!

398
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,500
Oh, I see.

399
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,066
Nao.

400
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,533
-I think--
-Who was that girl just now?

401
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,400
She's a classmate from elementary school.

402
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,700
What's wrong?

403
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:43,834
I thought you didn't like
receiving things from girls.

404
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,500
But there's nothing I could do.
She came to the door.

405
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,200
You took her to your work too, right?

406
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,667
Nanako told you?

407
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,233
So it's true.

408
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,600
I've never even been there.

409
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:08,166
Don't be stupid.

410
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,667
This isn't stupid!

411
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,867
I know you'd never cheat on me.

412
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,400
I know that, but I still don't like it.

413
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't like feeling all jealous.

414
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,367
I don't like being worried.

415
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:36,233
I want to believe that you'd never,
ever do such a thing,

416
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,834
but...

417
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,900
I just can't be that confident.

418
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,700
Nao.

419
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:58,900
Look at this.

420
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,400
Break up with Uehara, or I'll tell
the school you're living together!

421
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:10,533
It was taped to your locker at school.

422
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,633
{\an8}Oh, my god.

423
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,700
{\an8}You know...

424
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,800
when things like this happen...

425
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,800
I've been thinking about what to do.

426
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,567
Let's move somewhere together.

427
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,834
Together?

428
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,100
Yeah.

429
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,033
There you go crying again.

430
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:31,400
I can't help it.

431
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,300
Silly girl.

432
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,233
Italian salami sure is good.

433
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,100
Hey! Darn you!

434
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,967
I know you want to move,

435
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,900
but who would rent
to a couple of high school kids like us?

436
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:28,166
Besides, I don't want to give in
to whoever is doing this.

437
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:33,533
Moving away is just what they want!

438
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,200
So I think we need to--

439
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:40,133
Don't you even think
about trying to catch this person.

440
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,500
You have no idea what they're like.

441
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,066
I wouldn't try to catch them!

442
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,767
<i>I see.</i>

443
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,100
So that's why you want to move out.

444
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,467
Yes.

445
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,100
But we're still minors.

446
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,967
So I was wondering
if you could show us a place

447
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,967
that would rent even to us.

448
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Uehara, you've lost some weight,
haven't you?

449
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:17,300
I have?

450
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,734
You're working hard at your jobs too,
aren't you?

451
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:24,934
Yes.

452
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,734
If you move again,
it will cost a lot of money.

453
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:39,934
I understand your situation,

454
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,667
but maybe you should take this chance
to live separately.

455
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,266
If you keep living together,

456
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:53,533
you two might suffer

457
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,133
even more harm.

458
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,400
Thank you for worrying about us.

459
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:08,100
But...
living apart defeats the whole point.

460
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,633
It's worth it,
even if it means losing weight.

461
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,033
OK.

462
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,133
My phone!

463
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:40,533
Where is it?

464
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,667
What's she doing?

465
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,166
Take that!

466
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,367
Nao!

467
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:20,834
Who is this guy?

468
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,633
Yu?

469
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:25,734
What on earth are you doing here?

470
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,367
{\an8}QUIT LIVING TOGETHER AND DUMP NAO,
OR YOU'LL REGRET IT!

471
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,934
So you're the one?

472
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,333
It's all your fault,
two timing her like that.

473
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,667
You've been making her cry.

474
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,567
What?

475
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:49,166
I thought that if they broke up,
then you'd stop crying over him.

476
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,533
What in the world are you talking about?

477
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,133
Isn't this guy your boyfriend?

478
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,066
What? Is that true?

479
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:00,967
Are you kidding?

480
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:05,166
You're so stupid!

481
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,100
Mami had been acting odd for a while,

482
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:16,633
so I followed her.

483
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,433
She would buy food
and visit this building.

484
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,934
You were following me? You're crazy.

485
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,600
You were sad because he cheated on you.

486
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:25,734
I couldn't ignore it.

487
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,867
So you thought Uehara was my boyfriend?

488
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:34,900
He <i>was</i> your first love, right?

489
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,233
That was so long ago.

490
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,266
That's why you blackmailed him?
Wow! You're a real screw up.

491
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,967
This pisses me off.

492
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:46,367
For the longest time,
you've been pissing me off too!

493
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,900
In elementary school,

494
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:52,800
you refused her first true-love chocolates
that she gave you.

495
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,200
Oh, Yu!

496
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:58,767
I'm sure you can't understand
my frustration.

497
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:03,133
So basically, her first love was Uehara,

498
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,600
and your first love was her.

499
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,567
It's sure hard to get over
your first love.

500
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,033
I really am sorry about this.

501
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,133
I did this all on my own.

502
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:20,800
So go ahead and tell the police,
or the school.

503
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,100
I'm ready for whatever happens.

504
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,433
Forget it.

505
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,367
But if you ever try anything funny again,

506
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,367
I'll make you pay.

507
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,967
You sure you want to let him go?

508
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,967
-He's broken the law--
-Forget about it.

509
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Let's go, Yu.

510
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,266
Wait!

511
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,367
Apologize!

512
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,133
Apologize to Uehara.

513
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,266
-Forget it, Nao.
-I can't!

514
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,967
You called him a scumbag.

515
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,767
Apologize to him for that!

516
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,066
I'm sorry.

517
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,467
I envy those two.

518
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,300
You can tell that they're together
because they truly love each other.

519
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,633
No wonder I feel this way.

520
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,166
I thought I could share
the happiness he feels

521
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,633
if I am with Uehara.

522
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:06,600
I hurt his girlfriend too.

523
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,900
I'm a terrible person.

524
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,100
If you're a terrible person,
what does that make me?

525
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:14,367
I'm the one who tried to blackmail them.

526
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,533
Good question.

527
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,767
I wish I could have a romance like that.

528
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,734
Is that the guy?

529
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
Forget it!

530
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,633
-But--
-Just forget about it.

531
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,166
I want you to dump him.

532
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,400
Don't date guys that cheat.

533
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,433
You sure talk big.

534
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,467
Wait up, would you?

535
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:09,900
That settles that.

536
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:12,033
Thanks for helping, Issei.

537
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,200
No problem.

538
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,867
OK, thanks for letting me stay here.

539
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,033
You can come again anytime--

540
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,433
Don't ever come again!

541
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,400
Later.

542
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,600
Yeah. Bye.

543
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,867
You're creeping me out again.

544
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,266
It's just that

545
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:58,333
we solved the blackmail problem,

546
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,367
and Issei and his dad have made up,

547
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,900
and Yu's student teaching is over.

548
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,133
It's finally just us two.

549
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,066
Uehara!

550
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:31,400
Huh?

551
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,467
-Where did he go?
<i>-I'm leaving now.</i>

552
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,467
What? Hey! Wait a minute!

553
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,500
Wait for me, Uehara!

554
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:41,133
Wait up!

555
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,467
YOSHIKAWA NAO AND UEHARA HISASHI

556
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,166
ARE LIVING TOGETHER!

557
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:03,533
{\an8}HOW DID SHE SEDUCE HIM?

558
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,066
-Oh, Nao.
-Are you all right?

559
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:20,967
So the blackmailing isn't solved.

560
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,066
What's happening at school
is a different person.

561
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:34,500
Do you think it's true that Nao
and Uehara are living together?

562
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:35,900
Quit saying that crap!

563
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,266
It's total bull shit.

564
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,867
What are you going to do about this?

565
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,200
About what?

566
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,533
The rumors about living together.

567
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,867
Oh, that.

568
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:05,400
You're an idiot
if you think you can just ignore it.

569
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,066
I'm not ignoring it.

570
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:10,900
I'm telling you this
because I'm Nao's friend.

571
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,066
I don't care how it affects you.

572
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:18,500
I mean, you're a guy, after all.

573
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,900
But with rumors like that,

574
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:23,533
do you have any idea what happens
to a girl's reputation?

575
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,734
-Yeah, I do.
-No, you don't!

576
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,233
When all your girl fans
start spouting lies,

577
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,500
it could easily end up hurting Nao!

578
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,967
<i>I've called this meeting
about this morning's trouble.</i>

579
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:53,633
<i>Uehara would never do anything like that.</i>

580
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,467
<i>But "Where there's smoke, there's fire."</i>

581
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,166
I want you to check the truth behind this,
just to make absolutely certain.

582
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,467
Huh? I thought you were at work.

583
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:08,767
-I'm going now.
-Oh, I see.

584
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,433
-Uhm...
-Yes?

585
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,967
I need to talk to you.

586
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,100
About those posters?

587
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:24,767
It doesn't bother me at all.
I'm completely used to it.

588
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:32,300
What is it, Uehara?

589
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,333
Nao.

590
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:40,567
Yes?

591
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,734
I... want to live alone.

592
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,767
What?

593
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:18,400
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
