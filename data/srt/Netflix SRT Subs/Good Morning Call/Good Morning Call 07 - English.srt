1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,600
Yes?

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Yuri.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,667
What's wrong? You're soaking wet.

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,000
Yuri.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,100
What happened to you?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,900
Uehara...

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm getting a divorce.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
So... what is it this time?

9
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:46,200
{\an8}Probably just another fight
with my brother over something stupid.

10
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:50,200
{\an8}Something like he didn't notice
you changed your hair,

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,200
{\an8}or he ate some fried chicken
you were saving for yourself.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
They've always fought over dumb stuff.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
It's a waste of time to worry about them.

14
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,400
-But--
-Nao,

15
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:03,700
I'm sorry,
but can I stay here for a while?

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Sure, of course. That's fine.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,900
Thank you.

18
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:11,734
Hey. This is my house too, you know.

19
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:14,300
Please, may I?

20
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,567
What the heck happened between you?

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,700
Takuya...

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,000
He's been...

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,934
having an affair.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
-What?
-Really?

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
There's no way in hell my brother--

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,100
Yes he has! That's why...

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm getting a divorce.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,500
But...

29
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm going to talk with my brother.
I'll sleep over there tonight.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,600
OK.

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,100
-Take care of Yuri for me.
-OK, I will.

32
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,000
-Here.
-Thanks.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,700
Take care.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,767
I can't believe this. An affair?
Totally impossible.

35
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:14,500
That brother of mine
would never have an affair.

36
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh, that's hot!

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,000
I really can't believe... That's hot!

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,000
...that he had an affair.

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,400
I wonder
if Yuri really is going to get a divorce.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Hold on a second.

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,100
If that really does happen...

42
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,300
Uehara will...

43
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:03,467
I thought... I'd gotten over you...

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,834
but if you're leaving my brother,
that changes things.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,467
Uehara...

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,367
I'll make you mine and treat you well
our whole lives.

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,100
OK.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,300
<i>No, no, no!</i>

49
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,800
Not that!

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,934
Oh no! What should I do?

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Huh? Yuri?

52
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's... kiss.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,667
Huh?

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
{\an8}SAKE

55
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,400
I kiss anyone when I'm drunk.

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,834
Is that what's happening?

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,100
No... Wait, Yuri!

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,900
Yuri!

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,800
I really like you a lot,
but not in that way.

60
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a little soon for that,
I mean, it's going too far.

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,100
Oh!

62
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,834
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Eek!

63
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,700
Five times on the cheeks.

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,600
Three times on the forehead.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
I just barely covered my mouth.

66
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,600
That was close.

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,400
How pitiful that my second kiss was also
in a strange twist of events.

68
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Yes?

69
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Nao, I'm really, really sorry
about yesterday.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,767
It's totally all right, Yuri.

71
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
Wasn't I all over you last night?

72
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,200
Yikes!

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,900
I'm seriously going to quit drinking.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,300
Nao, if I try to have a drink,

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,100
knock me flat and bawl me out.

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,200
Got it.
I'll knock you flat and bawl you out.

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you. I'll need it.

78
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,734
No problem.

79
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,400
There they are.

80
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,867
Oh. Uehara.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,500
-Already in such a bad mood?
-Of course I am!

82
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,200
How come neither of you
have been answering your phones?

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,100
It made me worry about you.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Oh, you're right. There's a lot...

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,800
I turned my phone off.

86
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,500
My brother's called you a bunch of times.

87
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,300
Tell him that he doesn't have to.

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,100
-Tell him yourself.
-No way.

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,100
Why?

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Come here. I need to talk to you.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
OK, fine. See you later, Nao.

92
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:20,200
Yuri's taken off her wedding ring.

93
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,967
Nao... Good morning.

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,567
Good morning.

95
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:34,667
I like you. I like you, Nao.

96
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,100
-Is that the woman Uehara likes?
-Ah! Ah!

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,900
Oh, yeah. Marina is waiting for me.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,900
She asked me to go over
the math problems with her.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,500
That stuff's hard, you know. Math is--

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,900
-Morning. What's is it?
-Come on. Come with me.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
-Math is calling us.
-Huh? What do you mean?

102
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,100
-Nao!
-Yes?

103
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,600
I don't have practice today,
so let's walk home together.

104
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:07,200
Sorry... but I can't go home
with you today.

105
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,934
Sorry.

106
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm suspicious.

107
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,834
When Nao panics like that,
it always means she's hiding something.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm one reason she's panicking.

109
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:23,934
Really?

110
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,500
I told her I liked her.

111
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:33,934
Huh?

112
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,600
What... Hold on a second here.

113
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,800
Daichi told you he liked you?

114
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
You've got to be kidding.

115
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
Daichi is an old friend
and is like a big brother to her.

116
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,100
That kind of thing can turn into love,
you know.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,900
You really think so?

118
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,367
Just look at us.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,367
Oh... that's right.

120
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,367
So, what did you tell him?

121
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,567
He said, "I don't need an answer."

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,300
"I just wanted to tell you that."

123
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,600
Ahh... Daichi...

124
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,467
I can totally feel for him, right here.

125
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Nao, you realize that Uehara's
not the only guy around, right?

126
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,900
I mean, you're not with anyone now,

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
so maybe you should take Daichi seriously.

128
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,600
-But, for me, there's only--
<i>-Nao!</i>

129
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
Uehara.

130
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,300
Sorry, I've got to go.

131
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Nao's head over heels
with Uehara for sure.

132
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,900
But Uehara prefers Yuri, right?

133
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,300
Probably.

134
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,834
I think Nao and Daichi
would be a great pair, don't you?

135
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,734
I guess so.

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Any way you look at it,
Daichi is way kinder too.

137
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,000
Hmm...

138
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,934
You're going back to your home?

139
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,667
-Yeah.
-What?

140
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
But then, does that mean...

141
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,300
you're never coming back
to our place again?

142
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,300
-Don't be stupid. Of course I am.
-Really?

143
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,100
Just until this mess
with Yuri gets straightened out.

144
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:21,900
Oh, I see.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,567
Besides,
it drives me nuts when she's there.

146
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,767
I'd rather be at my house.

147
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,667
What is it?

148
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,800
Nothing.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
What did your brother say?

150
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,767
He said the affair is a misunderstanding,

151
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,734
but something seems fishy.

152
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,000
Hey, I'm really sorry.

153
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,667
Getting you involved
in my family's personal problems.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,100
I don't mind at all.
Besides, I really like Yuri.

155
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,300
I'm really glad to hear you say that.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
No problem.

157
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
Oh, and I didn't make lunch today.

158
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,467
It's OK.
I'll just get something at the canteen.

159
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,767
See you.

160
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:13,967
"It drives me nuts... when Yuri's there."

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,300
<i>Nao!</i>

162
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Daichi.

163
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,000
There's somewhere I'd like to take you.

164
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,767
Sorry, but I think I told you this morn--

165
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:32,300
You know, I've done a whole lot
of favors for you, Nao.

166
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes, that's very true.

167
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,300
-Excellent. OK, let's go.
-Huh?

168
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,734
What?

169
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,767
Uehara, kick it back.

170
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,200
Wow!

171
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,400
Wow! It's the Sky Tree.

172
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,300
It's amazing!

173
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Daichi, I didn't know you liked sweets.

174
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
I was in the mood...

175
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,767
but just looking at it has made me full.

176
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,867
You're kidding. What a waste!

177
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:23,200
-Then you have it, Nao.
-What?

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
No, it's OK. It's yours, Daichi.

179
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,400
They say the sundaes here are so marvelous

180
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,834
that you have to have at least one
before you die.

181
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,967
Yum! This really is delicious.

182
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,400
Oh. I'm sorry.

183
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,300
This was yours, but look how much I had.

184
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,667
I appreciate the concern,
but there's almost none left.

185
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,700
Oh, you're right. Hardly any...

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,100
Here.

187
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,500
You have it, Daichi.

188
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,500
All right, if you insist.

189
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,500
It's way too sweet.

190
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,367
Is Uehara there?

191
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Oh... for a while,
he's going to be living at his home.

192
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Really... That's good.

193
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,400
Daichi, I really like Ueha--

194
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
I know.

195
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,767
Then--

196
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,567
But doesn't he like that woman
from this morning?

197
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,300
Are you not giving up on him
even though he likes someone else?

198
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,000
I won't give up.

199
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,600
Like I thought.
So I'm not giving up either.

200
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,200
But that's different than--

201
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,567
It's the same.

202
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,467
Exactly the same.

203
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,600
I'll wait for you patiently.

204
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Waiting is my specialty.

205
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,100
OK, see you later.

206
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,200
Nao.

207
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,900
Marina.

208
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,100
This all feels kind of weird.

209
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,867
It's like Daichi is different
than the Daichi that I know.

210
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,500
Well...

211
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,967
Either way,
I don't think Daichi is different,

212
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,934
but now he's just serious about you.

213
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,934
Mitsuishi says

214
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,500
Daichi will treat you way nicer
than Uehara will.

215
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,100
That's not true!

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,867
I mean, I know Daichi is nice and kind.

217
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,400
But Uehara is too.

218
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,500
He bought me a cake on Christmas,

219
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
and he came back home
during that blackout.

220
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,500
I'll admit he says mean things,
and acts all big

221
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,900
and is cruel and grump
and eats too much...

222
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,200
Huh?
It sounds like there are more negatives--

223
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,867
But... But even so

224
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,800
after living with him for two months,

225
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,400
I can swear with confidence
that he is nice and kind.

226
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,100
Really?

227
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,500
Then I've made up my mind.

228
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Huh?

229
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,000
I feel bad for Daichi,

230
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,934
but I'm going to support you
in your romance with Uehara.

231
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:18,367
Charge ahead down the path you've chosen.

232
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,900
Marina...

233
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,767
So

234
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,400
where is that special Uehara? At work?

235
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
-Huh?
-Where is he?

236
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:33,567
Well, you see...

237
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,734
Huh?

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
Darn you! With all the time
you've been spending together,

239
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,467
how come you didn't take action
right away?

240
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,300
I can't help it.
The mood has never been right.

241
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,667
Ah!

242
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,900
You aren't trying hard enough!

243
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:56,200
How hard do you think Mitsuishi
and I have been working at it?

244
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Unlike you, we're not living together,
you know.

245
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,867
Oh, you're right.

246
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,600
Uehara and I will be like you guys
in the future.

247
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:08,567
You're a little late in realizing that.

248
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,300
Hmm...

249
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,100
I've got to make sure our time
together is well spent.

250
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,100
Marina sure is smart.

251
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:36,200
-I'm home.
-Oh, hi, Yuri.

252
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:41,834
-Huh? What's this? Tomorrow's lunch?
-Uh-huh.

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,767
That seems like a lot.

254
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
Really?

255
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Oh! You're making one for Uehara too, huh?

256
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,300
Well, uh...

257
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,000
I just happened to make a lot,
so I thought I'd make one for him too.

258
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,100
I thought it'd be nice.

259
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,200
I see...

260
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,000
Uehara... Huh?

261
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,300
Oh!

262
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,000
What are you doing?

263
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,934
We've only got a limited time.

264
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,500
Let's go!

265
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,700
-What's with you?
-Hurry!

266
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,200
What? Aren't you going to eat?

267
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,567
No.

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
My chest feels so warm.

269
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,834
Heartburn? You must have eaten too much.

270
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:47,000
You don't understand my feeling.

271
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,100
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

272
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,667
-Abe.
-This guy never learns.

273
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,000
Nao!

274
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Oh, no! I was so enjoying our time alone.

275
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,967
Nao, you won't believe this!

276
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,967
Did you confess your love again?

277
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,800
-And got turned down.
-Hey!

278
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,934
You'll never understand how I feel,
Uehara.

279
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,100
Now, now. Cheer up, Abe.

280
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,500
-Here, you can have my lunch.
-Really?

281
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,300
-Uh-huh. Eat up.
-All right!

282
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,867
Here you go.

283
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:27,500
-It looks delicious. Thank you!
-No problem.

284
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,500
-Huh?
-Hey! What're you doing?

285
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,900
-This won't be enough.
-How much can you eat?

286
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Enough for three.

287
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,000
You'll make yourself sick
if you eat that much.

288
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm a growing boy, so don't worry.

289
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
You skinny pig!

290
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
What?

291
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,100
-Like I said, you're a skinny pig.
-What are you talking about?

292
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,967
Oh, yeah. Tomorrow's Saturday.

293
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:56,700
Oh! If you need lunch
before your work tomorrow,

294
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,100
I'll make you one, OK?

295
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,767
You dummy. Tomorrow's a holiday.
Our foundation day.

296
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,700
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

297
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,400
Then the next day we'll meet is...

298
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,500
-In three days.
-You must be kidding...

299
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
This is the first time
since we've been living together

300
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,700
that we won't see each other
for two whole days.

301
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,834
Two days... That's a long time.

302
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,934
It's not that long.

303
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, by the way, what are your plans
for the weekend?

304
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,300
Work.

305
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
Oh, yeah. That's right.

306
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Later.

307
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,567
Bye.

308
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,100
I feel like I'm always saying goodbye
to Uehara.

309
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,734
He'd never text me.

310
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh!

311
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,100
Yuri, your phone's ringing.

312
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
I know.

313
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,200
{\an8}HISASHI UEHARA

314
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,400
Thanks, Nao. They probably
want me to work on my day off.

315
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,734
No, it's Uehara.

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,734
Not again.

317
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,100
I wish he'd call me.

318
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,700
<i>-Here you go.
-Huh?</i>

319
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,300
<i>"Rolled cabbage, wieners,</i>

320
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,100
clam chowder, hamburgers,

321
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
cars, computers, tako-yaki, tai-yaki..."

322
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:07,200
With these things,
you can capture Uehara's heart for sure.

323
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,500
What? All these?

324
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,300
Well, I've known him for a long time.

325
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,734
Ahh. I wish I could return to that pure,
innocent time.

326
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,800
You mean it's not like that now?

327
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Life's all messed up now.

328
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,500
Well, it was always just me
that was crazy in love.

329
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,834
That's never changed.

330
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
What? You mean with Takuya?

331
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,800
That's right.

332
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I hate to admit it

333
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,600
but he is really super handsome.

334
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
More than Uehara?

335
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,100
Yep. They're like chalk and cheese.

336
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,100
What? Uehara is chalk?

337
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,734
Yep. Oh, I know!

338
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,300
He's probably got an old photo album.

339
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,767
Uehara will get angry if he finds out
you've been in his room.

340
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:03,300
Then let him get angry.
There's no need to worry about it.

341
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,467
Wow! What a nice bed.
Come have a seat on it, Nao.

342
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,400
No, it's OK.

343
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:12,200
Don't be shy. Come on.

344
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,867
I'm not shy, just...

345
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I think he doesn't mind if you do that,
Yuri.

346
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
-Nao.
-Excuse me.

347
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,100
I've got to do some shopping.

348
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Ah! Wait! Hold on a sec, Nao.

349
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,600
I wonder... what Uehara's doing now.

350
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,600
-Ah! I'm sorry.
-No. It's my fault.

351
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Hey, you were talking with Uehara
the other day. You're that...

352
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,800
pretty woman.

353
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,734
Are you a friend of Uehara's?

354
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:14,900
Here you are!

355
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,000
It looks delicious! Yum!

356
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,800
Come here...

357
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,000
You've already got a new girlfriend?

358
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,300
No...

359
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,700
but I'm getting my courage up
to ask her out.

360
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,700
Oh, I see.

361
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,100
-Dad, one soft boiled egg!
-Here you go!

362
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,400
Eat up. It'll give you courage.
On the house.

363
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,934
Thank you, my teacher.

364
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
-So...
-Yes?

365
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,667
Are you friends with Nao too?

366
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,300
For sure. We're good friends.

367
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,000
Really?

368
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,300
Then from your point of view,
what do you think of those two?

369
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:58,500
What do I think?
I think they make a good couple.

370
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,967
That's because

371
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:04,834
Nao's working so hard at it,
don't you think?

372
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:06,600
Not really...

373
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,734
<i>-Thank you!
-No problem</i>

374
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:11,500
-Hey! What're you doing?
-This won't be enough.

375
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,500
-How much can you eat?
-Enough for three.

376
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,767
I think that Uehara likes Nao too.

377
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,600
What? You think so?

378
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,367
You think so?

379
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,200
See you later, guys.

380
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,100
See you.

381
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,200
-Nao.
-Daichi.

382
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,100
Ah! It's OK. I can carry those.

383
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,900
You sure bought a lot.
Have you been worrying over Uehara?

384
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,600
No, not really...

385
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,500
It's so easy to tell what you're thinking.

386
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,700
You think so?

387
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:00,700
But that's what I like about you.

388
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,667
Wait up.

389
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Daichi.

390
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,367
Ah! Uehara.

391
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,900
Nao! Uehara!

392
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,467
-Yuri! Abe?
-Yo!

393
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,400
You came back?

394
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,567
I just happened to be passing by,
that's all... Bye.

395
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:30,667
I have an idea!
Since Nao's friends are all here,

396
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:33,000
today we're going to have
a great big party!

397
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,800
-Really? All right!
-Come on.

398
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
What the hell are you thinking?

399
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,400
If you're worried, then you'll
just have to join us, won't you?

400
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:40,600
What?

401
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,900
Come on, you two. Let's go.

402
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,734
-Huh?
-Come on. This way.

403
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,100
Since you insisted, we came.

404
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,300
-Oh! Welcome!
-Come on in!

405
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
-Thanks for inviting us.
-No problem.

406
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,600
We'll start by using these.

407
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Go ahead.

408
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,467
Oh, OK.

409
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,667
Thanks, Mitsuishi.

410
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,500
<i>Domino's Pizza.</i>

411
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,400
Hey, the pizza's here.

412
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,600
Hey, handsome. You too, handsome.
Give me a hand.

413
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,934
-Me too?
-Did you hear? I'm handsome.

414
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,767
-What?
-She said he's handsome.

415
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,700
That'll go to his head for sure.

416
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:29,467
Wow, I never thought you
and Uehara were living together, Nao.

417
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:32,467
It's like you've got a head start.

418
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:39,300
You know, Abe, you've got to find yourself
a girlfriend first.

419
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,400
That's right.

420
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,867
Right now,
Yuri and I are really getting along.

421
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,900
I think I'm going to confess my love
to her today.

422
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
What are you thinking?
Yuri's married, you know.

423
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,300
Anyway, forget that. Put out the plates.

424
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,100
What? What?

425
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,700
No, no. You're mistaken.

426
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,767
No, I'm not mistaken at all.

427
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:02,200
-Really? You're not?
-Never mind, Abe.

428
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,500
-Never mind?
-Never mind!

429
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,734
OK, looks like we're ready. Shall we?

430
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,400
-Uh-huh. One, two...
-Let's eat!

431
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,500
This looks delicious.

432
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
This is all on me today,
so eat all you want.

433
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:20,700
Thank you!

434
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:24,400
I'm going to eat until I burst!
Give me that fried chicken.

435
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:27,200
I don't know where to start.

436
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,600
Yum! This potato salad is delicious, Nao.

437
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,767
Really? But I always start with--

438
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,100
This, right?

439
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
-Uh-huh.
-Here.

440
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
Thank you.

441
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,700
You dummy! You can't eat just meat.

442
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,200
I can eat whatever I like.

443
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:53,967
Hey.

444
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,200
Here.

445
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,500
No meat for you until you eat this.

446
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,500
-Oh, Abe!
-Yes?

447
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,900
Can you get me another drink?

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,600
She's already made me her gofer.

449
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,200
What flavor do you want, Yuri?

450
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,400
Orange.

451
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
OK.

452
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,900
Nao, go get some dressing.

453
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,800
Go get it yourself.

454
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:29,700
{\an8}ORANGE <i>CHUHAI</i> ALCOHOL 8%

455
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,600
{\an8}Thank you.

456
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,767
Ahh!

457
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:48,367
Dammit. Who let her drink alcohol?

458
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Don't touch me. It was you?

459
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,100
Yeah,

460
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,300
but I didn't know she'd end up like that.

461
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,200
Aah!

462
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,700
Abe, I found you!

463
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,400
Get over here.

464
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
-Let's kiss.
-Really? We can?

465
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,867
Yes--

466
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,767
You're so cruel to me, Uehara.

467
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:12,000
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

468
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:16,900
Marina, uh...

469
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,934
Wait! Disappear, Mitsuishi!

470
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:23,500
-Ow! You totally kicked me.
-Out of the way!

471
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,800
-Ah! No, I couldn't.
-Daichi!

472
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,200
Hey, Yuri!

473
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,734
Oh! That's mine.

474
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,000
OK, OK.

475
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,400
Hello?

476
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't have anything
to do with him anymore.

477
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:53,500
Don't you see?

478
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm divorcing Takuya!

479
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,734
Fine. Do what you like.

480
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Sorry about that.
You young kids enjoy yourselves.

481
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,400
The old person will now go get depressed.

482
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,200
-I'll need your room, Nao.
-Hey, Yuri. Wait!

483
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,200
<i>I see...</i>

484
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,900
Yuri's had a rough time, huh?

485
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,200
Yeah.

486
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,800
-OK, bye. See you.
-Yeah, see you.

487
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,500
-Thanks for coming.
-No problem.

488
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:45,567
Ahh, adults sure do have it hard.

489
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,100
I've got a bruise here for sure.

490
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,066
Yuri says she wants to talk to you.

491
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
OK.

492
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,767
<i>It's Nao. Can I come in?</i>

493
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,000
Uh-huh.

494
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,700
Sorry. I drank too much again.

495
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,600
Who was that call from?

496
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,700
It was Takuya's...

497
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,700
girlfriend from university.

498
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,934
Even since they broke up,
they've been seeing each other as friends.

499
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:02,400
He even lied to me to go and see her
in the evening.

500
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Ahh. I really hate myself.

501
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:12,467
I was always chasing after him.

502
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,300
I must seem like a fool.

503
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,934
I don't think so.

504
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,000
Really?

505
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:32,700
I think when you like someone,
you turn into a kind of fool.

506
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,000
That person is always on your mind.

507
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,800
You get upset over silly things
and worry about him for no reason.

508
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,600
<i>But when you're with him,
you're incredibly happy.</i>

509
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,100
All your troubles and worries
are instantly swept away.

510
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,100
Nao.

511
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,934
Oh, uh...

512
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,667
Anyway, it's OK to be a fool, Yuri.

513
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,000
Huh?

514
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:19,200
Uh, I don't mean that kind of thing.

515
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh... I don't know how to put it.

516
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,934
Thank you, Nao.

517
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,100
Sure.

518
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,567
Is Yuri all right?

519
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,667
-Yeah, maybe.
-"Maybe"?

520
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,600
If you're that worried about her,
you go talk to her.

521
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,567
This has nothing to do with you.

522
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,100
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt you guys.

523
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
-What?
-What?

524
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,867
My stomach hurts.

525
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
-Huh?
-Huh?

526
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,100
What's with that guy?

527
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,600
I think he overate.

528
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,900
He'll be fine. He took medicine.

529
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,600
So where the heck am I supposed to sleep?

530
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,200
Oh... Yuri's using my room too.

531
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,200
We'll just have to sleep here tonight.

532
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,734
You two...
You're going to sleep here together?

533
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,200
You're going to miss the last train.

534
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
-I'm staying over tonight.
-Huh?

535
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:15,300
-Hey, you crashed into me on purpose.
-No, it was just an accident.

536
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Oh, sorry. I didn't see you.

537
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,400
So much happened that I can't sleep now.

538
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,300
Then how about something to eat?

539
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,200
Oh! You're awake, Uehara?

540
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,400
Yeah.

541
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,500
Huh? What's that?

542
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,567
The one thing we both agree on.

543
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,000
You got that for me?

544
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,800
No, I just thought
you might want to have one.

545
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,367
You mean you came here to see me today?

546
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,500
Huh? What're you talking about?

547
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, nothing. Let's eat.

548
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,200
-Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

549
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,300
Yum! Dang, this is good.

550
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,734
But a little warm.

551
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,100
So you think of milk pudding
when you think of me, huh?

552
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
What are all the smiles about?

553
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,100
Even though we've only been together
for a short time,

554
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,867
we've already got this in common.

555
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,000
Huh?

556
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,700
Yum!

557
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Today, this pudding is better than usual.

558
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,934
That doesn't make sense.

559
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,200
Because this is full of your kindness.

560
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:55,500
I told you,
I just happened to be passing by.

561
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,200
Really?

562
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,100
Yeah, really.

563
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:02,900
You going to eat that? I'll have it.

564
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,800
-You can't have it.
-Huh? Hey...

565
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,000
-Look.
-Huh?

566
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Yum! This is so good.

567
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,900
Yum. Pretty good, isn't it?

568
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,300
Ahh, what fine weather again today.
I'm feeling fine too.

569
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,400
OK, then get out right now.

570
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,967
Huh? Ah! Oh!

571
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,834
Jeez, you sure are cold to me.

572
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,400
Oops!

573
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,600
Ahh, now I'm all cold.

574
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:16,367
Hey, you're living at your house, right?
Let's go back together.

575
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,800
I want to talk to you about something.

576
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,200
Yeah, sure.

577
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,500
What did you want to talk about?

578
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,734
You like Yuri, don't you?

579
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,300
That's none of your business--

580
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,467
I really don't care at all who you like.

581
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,467
But I will never stand for Nao
to get hurt by you.

582
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:49,867
She and I aren't like that.

583
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:50,900
Then why the hell...

584
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,000
Why don't you tell her that?

585
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,734
Don't you dare take this lightly.

586
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,700
I've told Nao that I like her.

587
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,734
Nice to meet you. Thank you
for always looking after my brother.

588
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,100
Your brother?

589
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:20,100
I'm Uehara's older brother, Takuya.

590
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:23,000
Older brother...

591
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,600
Oh! You're Uehara's big brother?

592
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,500
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
