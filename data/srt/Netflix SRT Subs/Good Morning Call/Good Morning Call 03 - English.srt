1
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,667
Yuri.

2
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,367
<i>Yuri?</i>

3
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,300
Yuri.

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,400
<i>So she's Uehara's girlfriend.</i>

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,100
Ouch!

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,000
What're you whining about?
Pulling a disappearing act like that!

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Do you realize how worried we were
about you?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,900
Ow!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,900
-How dare you click your tongue at me?
-Let go of me!

10
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:03,100
You lost weight again, didn't you?

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
No I didn't.

12
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,900
-You look like a zombie.
-It's just the lighting.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,100
I bet you're just eating junk, aren't you?

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
It's way better than your cooking.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Hey, I'm still sick!

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,800
Which is why
I'm telling you to come back home.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,700
We'll have a proper talk together
about your future and--

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,867
No way.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
What?

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,600
You know, I don't think
you even have the right to talk like that.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,500
Whose fault do you think it was
that I left?

22
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,200
Hmm? Let me think.

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
-Hey!
-I'm just kidding.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,967
In any case,
if you're going to wreck your health

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,667
because you're living alone,
then I'm dragging you back home.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
You don't even know where I live.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
The doctor told me.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,300
I couldn't help it. They asked me.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
You blabber.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,066
How dare you scold
the person you owe your life to?

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,900
Would you cut it out with the hitting?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
You ungrateful smart-ass!

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,900
I am <i>not</i> ungrateful.

34
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,867
Then at least try to act it.

35
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,000
Why you!

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,867
OK, I'll be going now.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,900
OK.

38
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,600
Hey, at least thank her.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
Thanks... for all your help.

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,500
It's OK. Take care of yourself.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,667
Yeah.

42
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:39,734
Ah! Wait a second. Let's go together.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,834
I want to ask you about Hisashi.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,567
I want to go to tell the doctor thanks.

45
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,400
Wait for me in the lobby, OK?

46
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,000
OK.

47
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:04,667
That was a wedding ring, right?

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,734
Wait! That means...

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,800
they're having an affair?

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,734
An affair...

51
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,967
Uehara and that pretty woman...

52
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,734
We can't. I have a husband--

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Yuri. I want you to be mine.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,467
Hisashi.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,800
No, no, no!

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,900
That... that's for grownups! For adults!

57
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:21,667
But...
Uehara seemed so right in that scene.

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,200
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,300
Oh... no. I'm fine.

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm Uehara Yuri.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Here's my card. My number's on it.

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,934
Thank you.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,100
Uehara

64
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:51,100
{\an8}Oh, I'm Hisashi's sister-in-law.

65
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:55,734
His older brother is Takuya.
He's my husband.

66
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,500
Now I see.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,900
What?

68
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,700
Uehara and his sister-in-law are having
an aff...

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Huh?

70
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm Yoshikawa Nao.

71
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,667
Nao. That's a pretty name.

72
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:16,200
Thank you for taking care of Hisashi.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,300
No problem.

74
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,800
You're his girlfriend, right?

75
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,900
What? Whose girlfriend?

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,867
Hisashi's. You're Hisashi's girlfriend.

77
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,300
No, no! Not at all. We're just classmates.

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
What? Really?

79
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,100
That's unusual.

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
There's not many people
he's that relaxed with

81
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,100
so I totally thought you were.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,500
I wouldn't call it relaxed.
More like insulting.

83
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh! I have an idea!

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,900
Nao, can you also tell him

85
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,100
to come back home?

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,100
Huh?

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,500
He doesn't listen to a word I say.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,734
He's a real smart-ass, that <i>man-brat.</i>

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
<i>Man-brat</i>?

90
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,767
That's my nickname for Hisashi.

91
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:03,300
He looks older than he is,
but inside he's still a brat.

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,500
So I call him <i>man-brat.</i>

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I see. He sure is.

94
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,667
Uh-oh.
I've got to get back to the office.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,700
What? Now?

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,100
Uh-huh.
I'm an editor at an information magazine.

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
It's always like this before a deadline.

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,200
It's a real pain. Bye.

99
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,967
<i>Yuri sure was cool.</i>

100
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,700
She's beautiful as well.

101
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,100
I wonder if
I'll be like that in a few years too?

102
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,600
<i>The hell you will.</i>

103
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Huh?

104
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,300
Is he...

105
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:28,934
Damn him!
I got so used to hearing his insults.

106
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,367
You're such a jerk, Uehara!

107
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,600
Wait a minute...

108
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,767
He's coming back, isn't he?

109
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:53,367
He's not going back to his home,
right?

110
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,867
See ya!

111
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,567
Huh? W... wait! Wait!

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,200
This month's $1,500, please.

113
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,600
Ah!

114
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,934
No! No way! I can't pay!

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,734
What'll I do?

116
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll keep Uehara here
by winning him over with food.

117
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,934
The amount of food is more important
than the taste.

118
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,667
I'll make him tons of dishes.

119
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,200

Oh, that scared me.

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,400

Totally!
How could Uehara choose Yoshikawa?

127
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,400
Can you believe it?

128
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,800
Yo! Morning, Daichi.

129
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,400
-Morning.
-Morning.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,667
Good morning, Marina.

131
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,200
Hiro, did you prep for Algebra II?

132
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Yeah, I did.

133
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh, there's a part I wanted to ask about.

134
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,000
Where?

135
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,200
We've got Music next. Let's go together.

136
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,300
Huh?

137
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,400
Hey, Marina.

138
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,700
What?

139
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm sorry... Daichi.

140
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,900
-Nao.
-Yes?

141
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:24,667
Uh, nothing... I just...

142
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
-Nao, are you--
-Marina's getting away.

143
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,967
Sorry. We can talk later.

144
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,100
-Eek!
-Eek!

145
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,300
Darn you!

146
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,100
Quit following me.

147
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,600
How come you're ignoring me?

148
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,467
Because you lied to me.

149
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,834
You really are Uehara's girlfriend.

150
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,700
She is my girlfriend.

151
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,400
How did you find out?

152
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,100
Uehara of the top three has a girlfriend.

153
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,667
That kind of news spreads like wildfire.

154
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,667
-But, you see--
-Don't get me wrong.

155
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,300
I'm not angry
that you're Uehara's girlfriend.

156
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
What?

157
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm pissed at you

158
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
because you lied to me
that there was nothing between you two.

159
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,400
I know it's not easy to tell me

160
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,300
because I'm always talking about Uehara.

161
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:39,500
But you and I have known each other
for so much longer.

162
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,400
And I thought I was your best friend.

163
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:47,500
It's like you're putting up a front,

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,500
but in your heart, you're blowing me off.

165
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Marina...

166
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,667
How come you're going to cry?

167
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,767
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Tell me everything from now on, OK?
I'll tell you everything about me too.

169
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,367
-OK.
-Good.

170
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,467
-I...
-Yes?

171
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,300
To tell the truth,
we're pretending to be dating.

172
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,400
What?

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
Oh. Class is going to start.

174
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
Huh? Hey!

175
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:44,300
Hey, Wait!
You'd better fill me in later! Wait!

176
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,400
Hold on a second!

177
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,867
You mean
you and Uehara are living there together?

178
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,400
Hey! Who told you?

179
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,300
That's right.
So to keep people from finding out

180
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,300
that they're living together,
he said to pretend that they're dating.

181
00:14:55,834 --> 00:15:00,400
I thought he was a Prince Charming,
but she says he's a stuck-up jerk.

182
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,100
Yeah, that's absolutely right!

183
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,867
What's worse, he's got everyone fooled.

184
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,400
Isn't he awful, Mitsuishi?

185
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
Uh, but don't you think

186
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,867
the bigger problem is
the fact you're living with a guy?

187
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:13,000
There haven't been any problems yet.

188
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,700
What're you talking about?

189
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,600
Of course there has.

190
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
Are you taking that to Uehara
at the hospital?

191
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Yep.

192
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,900
It's part of my plan to use food
to keep him from leaving.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,600
So you were up all night cooking.

194
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,200
How did you know?

195
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,700
Rings under your eyes.

196
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,300
He's such a big eater,
I thought I'd better make a lot.

197
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
It took forever.

198
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,200
You know, Nao, I think you like Uehara.

199
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,934
What? Of course I don't!

200
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
I never said anything like that.

201
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,800
That's what's called

202
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
getting to a man's heart
through his stomach.

203
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
I see.

204
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,800
I told you I'm not!

205
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Uehara has a real girlfriend.

206
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
-What?
-What? Who?

207
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,200
His older brother's wife.

208
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,667
She's super pretty.
So cheerful and kind too.

209
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,367
Competent at her job as well.

210
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,967
A real grown-up woman.

211
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
I'm not visiting him.

212
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,400
Why not?

213
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Because she can take care of him.

214
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,567
Yep. She'll do it.

215
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:30,066
She'll take care of him, so I'm not.

216
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm going to eat this myself.

217
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,200
I'm not going. Nope. Not going.

218
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:41,200
Everyone I know is so blind to love.

219
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,500
You are too.

220
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,567
Did you say something?

221
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,200
No.

222
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,000
Maybe I'll just look in on him.

223
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
God damn him!

224
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:22,300
Yo.

225
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
What's that supposed to mean?

226
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,867
You could at least
tell me you were released.

227
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,100
I don't have your number.

228
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh...

229
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,200
ADDED TO MY CONTACTS

230
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,066
Here.

231
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Don't always be contacting me.
I hate Line and texting.

232
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:49,700
Why would I contact you
if I didn't have a reason?

233
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,000
What's that?

234
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,734
Oh... That's your dinner.

235
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,300
I'll have it for a midnight snack.

236
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:03,100
You should have dinner before that.

237
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,967
Don't tell me that...

238
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,500
You ate it all!

239
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,000
Hey!

240
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,300
You broke the rules!
You ate my food without permission!

241
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,500
Oh...

242
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:34,867
I'm recovering so I made an exception.

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
What?

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,467
That ticks me off!
Who said he could make an exception?

245
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:47,734
And how can he eat that much
when he's supposed to be recovering?

246
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
He actually did come back here.

247
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:05,767
Darn it all.
And I was enjoying living alone so much.

248
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,100
{\an8}Oh, that's right.

249
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
MOM

250
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,567
It's Mom.

251
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>Are you eating nutritiously?</i>

252
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:30,700
You wouldn't believe it,
but I'm cooking for myself.

253
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,500
<i>Well, that's good to hear.</i>

254
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:36,000
<i>Oh. You're not forgetting
what your real job as a student is, right?</i>

255
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,600
I've got that covered too.

256
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,000
It's so much easier to study
when I'm living alone.

257
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:45,200
<i>Oh, is that so?
Are you ready for your next final--</i>

258
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,000
Trust me, Mom. I've changed.

259
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,867
I might even make it
into the top half of the class.

260
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,700
<i>Really? That's great.</i>

261
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,500
<i>Your father and I talked this over.</i>

262
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>If you're not in the top half,
then you won't be living alone anymore.</i>

263
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,700
OK. Piece of cake.

264
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,800
<i>Really? I'm looking forward to it.</i>

265
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,600
OK. Bye.

266
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Did I really say, <i>piece of cake</i>?

267
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,767
When are finals?

268
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
From Tuesday.

269
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,967
Today's Saturday.

270
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

271
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh, no!

272
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:45,300
I'm more likely to be out of here
than Uehara is.

273
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
I've got to study!

274
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
My pencils! Oops!

275
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Welcome home.
Must be hard working so early.

276
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Yeah, thanks.

277
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,000
Were you up all night?

278
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,000
Tests are coming up.

279
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Oh, yeah. Must be tough being stupid.

280
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,500
Are you OK?

281
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,734
Oh, yeah!

282
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,767
I've got you!

283
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,600
Uehara! Tutor me, please!

284
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,400
-No.
-What?

285
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,400
-Why not?
-It'd be a real pain.

286
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:44,200
And you seem like a poor learner.
All it would do is exhaust me.

287
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,000
All you do is complain.

288
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:50,467
You really are a <i>man-brat.</i>

289
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,000
Did you and Yuri...

290
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,000
Forget it.

291
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,400
{\an8}Uehara
Yuri's Married-Uehara's Older Brother

292
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,667
Oh, no! I haven't made any progress!

293
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,900
I can't understand this!

294
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,900
I can't understand this!

295
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,867
I can't understand...

296
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,000
{\an8}FINALS

297
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:15,667
Sorry, I can't.

298
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,967
We've got a practice game today.

299
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,767
Oh, I see. Yeah, I guess you're busy.

300
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,700
You've always been the type

301
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:31,000
that won't start
until you're up against a wall.

302
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,200
Summer vacation homework,
research projects and book reports.

303
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,400
Oh, yeah. Your somersault practice too.

304
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:46,100
You helped me with all those, Daichi.

305
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,500
It'd be nice
if you appreciated me a little more.

306
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,000
I do, Daichi.

307
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,734
I totally appreciate what you've done.

308
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,800
OK, I'll do it.

309
00:23:56,834 --> 00:24:01,667
But I really do need
to stop depending on you.

310
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:05,700
Yes?

311
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:09,100
Nothing. Do your best. Bye.

312
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
OK. Thanks. Bye.

313
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,600
That's Yuri.

314
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
That was close.

315
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,200
OA times OB cosine C

316
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,934
minus one half, parentheses, A times B...

317
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,100
Huh? What was it again?

318
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,300
Oh! It's vector.

319
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,100
-Huh?
-Hey there.

320
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,700
Yuri!

321
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:12,300
-Yum! It's delicious!
-This is great.

322
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,600
It's delicious.

323
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm so glad I ran into you, Nao.

324
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,600
I left him a message
to say I was going to drop by

325
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,100
but he never called back.

326
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:24,800
Could you call him for me, Nao?

327
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
I can't get in unless he's there.

328
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,667
Oh, I think he's working today.
Probably...

329
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:34,000
What? He is?

330
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,300
Darn him. Why can't he just call?
He's such a pain.

331
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,000
Uhm, Yuri...

332
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,667
Why don't you call me Yuririn?

333
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,000
Yuririn?

334
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,300
Right.
And you don't have to talk so polite.

335
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,200
Then, Yuririn...

336
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes? What is it?

337
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,700
Uhm...

338
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,900
Uehara... Is he...

339
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,800
Did he say something about me?

340
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:20,834
But... when he's with you,
he seems different than usual.

341
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
He looks so pained.

342
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,834
I think I was his first love.

343
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:31,800
Really?

344
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,500
<i>Takuya and Hisashi's family
and mine were friends,</i>

345
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:38,000
<i>so we got along really well.</i>

346
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,934
<i>The three of us would always
play around as kids.</i>

347
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:47,200
<i>But when their parents died,
they became depressed.</i>

348
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,900
<i>I said I'd be their mother instead.</i>

349
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>So I was always over at their house.</i>

350
00:26:56,667 --> 00:27:02,200
Then I fell in love with him...
Takuya, I mean.

351
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,734
Hisashi is like a little brother to me.

352
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,600
I had absolutely no clue
that he had a crush on me.

353
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,900
<i>Not long after, we got married</i>

354
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,934
<i>and I was living in the Uehara house.</i>

355
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,867
<i>He told me.</i>

356
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,767
<i>"I can't live with the woman I like
and her husband."</i>

357
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,000
It must have been hard for him.
I really felt bad about it.

358
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,367
But...

359
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,066
But, seriously!

360
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,700
Takuya and I were newlyweds
and so in love.

361
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,300
We couldn't help it.

362
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,200
If he liked me,
then he should have said sooner!

363
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
Well, I guess that

364
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:53,600
getting drunk and kissing him a bunch
probably gave him the wrong idea.

365
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:54,600
What?

366
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,800
Oh, dear.
I'll kiss anyone when I'm drunk.

367
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,100
Oh, really.

368
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,500
I'm sure I've kissed Hisashi 20 times.

369
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,867
What? 20 times?

370
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,967
Are you jealous?

371
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,400
No. There's nothing between us--

372
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,100
Yeah, yeah. Sure. OK!

373
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,700
Since I've come all this way,
I may as well see his place.

374
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:19,734
Huh? What? Wait! Wait!

375
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,400
Wait!

376
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,300
You forgot this!

377
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,700
Hold on!

378
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,767
Yes. I'm OK.

379
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,700
Seriously, I'm just fine.

380
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,200
It's alright.
Don't push yourself when you're still ill.

381
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,300
I'm good. I really am all better.

382
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,500
Take the day off and relax.

383
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,667
Bye.

384
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Uehara...

385
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,967
He hung up?

386
00:28:56,967 --> 00:29:00,400
If they're going to cancel,
I wish they'd tell us sooner.

387
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,100
They said they caught the flu.

388
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,900
What? Seriously?

389
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
See you.

390
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,100
-See you later.
-See you.

391
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,800
Hey!

392
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,867
Oh, Daichi. Where are you headed?

393
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:15,900
Nao's place.

394
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,967
Our game was cancelled,
so I'm going over to tutor her.

395
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,734
Later.

396
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,000
Nao's place?

397
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,400
Uh...
There'll be trouble if Uehara's there.

398
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,300
Serious trouble.
Daichi's kind of old-fashioned.

399
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,967
If he found out that Nao and Uehara are
living together...

400
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
What would happen?

401
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,200
Run, Mitsuishi!

402
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:40,500
Oh, my god!

403
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,700
Seriously?

404
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,000
Let's jump rope.

405
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,200
Come on, Mitsuishi. Hurry up!

406
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,300
Yes?

407
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,100
Yo!

408
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,100
-Uh...
-Uh...

409
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:24,367
Who are you?

410
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,367
Isn't this Yoshikawa Nao's place?

411
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
God damn her.

412
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Aren't you the junior, Uehara?

413
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,934
Yeah. What of it?

414
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,100
What are you doing in Nao's place?

415
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:50,300
Hello there! We're coming in, Uehara.

416
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,600
What're you two doing?

417
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,100
Leave this to us.

418
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Huh? Hey!

419
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,000
Hey! I'm not finished talking to you!

420
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,900
Daichi, don't get so worked up, OK?

421
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,900
Hey, guys!

422
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:02,567
I've got milk tea.
Why don't we take a break?

423
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,400
-Hey! That's mine!
-What?

424
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
-Give it back. Give it back.
-Wait! Stop!

425
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Uehara! Are you and Nao--

426
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,700
I'm drinking this!

427
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:11,900
That's mine. Don't you dare!

428
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,200
Who cares about that--

429
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,200
Now, now. Take a deep breath.

430
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,400
Get out of my way, Mitsuishi!

431
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,734
Oh! Look at all these people!

432
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,667
What fun!

433
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,300
-Nice to meet all of you.
-Nao!

434
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,100
I'm Hisashi's sister-in-law, Yuri.

435
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Nao...

436
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
-God damn you!
-Are you all Hisashi's friends?

437
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,767
Of course they're not!

438
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:37,834
Really?

439
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,500
Nao, are you Uehara's girlfriend?

440
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,734
Uh...

441
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,000
Daichi! Daichi!

442
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,900
Nao's living with him,
but she's not his girl--

443
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What? Living together?

444
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,734
You're living with Hisashi?

445
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,100
I knew it! You're his girlfriend.

446
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,800
No, I'm not!

447
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,367
We <i>are</i> living together--

448
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,000
Pretend! They're pretending dating!

449
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,000
That's right!

450
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,700
Why do you have to live together
if you're just pretending?

451
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,000
Wait a minute!

452
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,800
Are you after her body, Hisashi?

453
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,800
After her body?

454
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:07,100
-No way! How shameful!
-It's total chaos!

455
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,900
What the hell are you thinking--

456
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,734
Shut up!

457
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,767
I'll tell you everything.

458
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,934
So everybody, just shut up.

459
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,700
Ow!

460
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:38,200
That's the story. All of it.

461
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,000
Yay!

462
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,400
I've got no interest in her at all.

463
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,000
Damn, you're awfully frank.

464
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,000
She feels the same about me.
We're simply living together.

465
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,500
Right?

466
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,500
Yes... That's exactly right.

467
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,767
Besides,
she's moving to the dorms in April.

468
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,734
And I plan to save enough money
to move by then.

469
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,734
So I'd like to continue...
living together like this.

470
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,567
Uhm...

471
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This is the first time...
Uehara and I have lived alone.

472
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,800
We're trying to figure things out,
so we're alike in that.

473
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:31,767
I'm not like you.

474
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,200
We always fight,

475
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,000
but since we're alike,
we understand each other.

476
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,767
It's reassuring.

477
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,400
So, I know you're worried about us,

478
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
but...

479
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,200
please let us continue living together.
Please.

480
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,100
Please.

481
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:21,467
Yuri.

482
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm sorry I kept it secret
that we were living together.

483
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,000
It doesn't bother me at all.

484
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,467
I understand what Hisashi's situation is.

485
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,900
Since it's with you, Nao,
I feel good about it.

486
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,934
Yuri.

487
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,734
OK, see you later. Take care of Hisashi.

488
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,500
-Nao.
-Yes?

489
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I thought Uehara and Yuri
were having an affair.

490
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,767
-I misunderstood.
-How could you do that?

491
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,400
Well, I was half right.

492
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
Huh?

493
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,000
What?

494
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,100
I can't understand
your way of thinking at all.

495
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,800
Huh?

496
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,400
How can you live with a total stranger?
And she's a girl too?

497
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,600
-What business is it of yours?
-Are you doing this because it's Nao?

498
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:36,700
Because you think
she'll be easy to control?

499
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,834
And so what if I do?

500
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,900
You're the type

501
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,867
that hurts others without even knowing it.

502
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,000
What does that mean?

503
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,767
Exactly like it sounds.

504
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,500
Oh!

505
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:08,567
Daichi... You're angry, aren't you?

506
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you.

507
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:24,200
If anything happens,
you come straight over to my place.

508
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,400
OK.

509
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,500
Thanks for everything.

510
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,000
Christ!
You've been nothing but trouble for me.

511
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,800
How dare you!
Quit acting like it's all my fault.

512
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:57,200
You brought them all over here, right?

513
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,867
Yes. I'm sorry.

514
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:07,567
Well, at least it all worked out.

515
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,934
Huh? What?

516
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,500
High five.

517
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,900
Ow!
Why do you have to use such force?

518
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,800
Anyway,
we can breathe a little easier now.

519
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,500
You really are happy-go-lucky.
I'm going to bed.

520
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:34,767
Oh, no!

521
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:36,800
What's wrong?

522
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,467
-Tests...
-Huh?

523
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,567
If I don't get a good score on my tests,
I'll have to go back home.

524
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,300
Are you kidding me?

525
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,200
I told you before!
How come you can't understand this?

526
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,800
I can't help it if I can't understand.
It's not my fault.

527
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,600
Use the formula, damn it.

528
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,600
I told you too!

529
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,800
There are so many formulas.
There's one here too.

530
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,934
It's this one.

531
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:01,200
-Which one?
-Not that one.

532
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,100
It's so hard!

533
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,400
What? It's your head that's hard.

534
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,200
-Cut it out! That hurt.
-How come you can't...

535
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:12,500

543
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,734
I did it! I'm in!

544
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,500
I did it!

545
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,600
<i>I did it!</i>

546
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,500
<i>I did it, Uehara! 87th place!</i>

547
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,700
<i>I won't have to go back
to the countryside!</i>

548
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,300
Just barely. That sure was close.

549
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,767
<i>To thank you, I'll treat you
something nice. You want milk pudding?</i>

550
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,700
Yeah.

551
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,567
Premium milk pudding.

552
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,200
Got it.

553
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,467
{\an8}MILK PUDDING, PREMIUM MILK PUDDING

554
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:15,400
Yes! I'm in luck.

555
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,300
Huh? What?

556
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,667
Hey! Wait! What?
You're getting them all?

557
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,700
-Come on.
-What?

558
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,934
Wait!

559
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,700
-They've got big size too.
-What?

560
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:36,967
Ah!

561
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,500
Oh! That's good too.

562
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,600
-Start with rock!
-Rock!

563
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,300
-Rock-paper-scissors!
-Rock-paper-scissors!

564
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,800
-It's a tie!
-It's a tie!

565
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,800
-It's a tie!
-It's a tie!

566
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,667
-Ah...
-Yes!

567
00:41:58,467 --> 00:41:59,500
Come on.

568
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,667
Me again?

569
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,500
Oh, alright.

570
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,867
-Thank--
-Here.

571
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,500
Here.

572
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
"Here! Here!" What a jerk!

573
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:18,734
Damn it!

574
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,100
So heavy...
They're so heavy.

575
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,700
Could you please carry just one?
Just one.

576
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,934
Please carry just one.

577
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, alright.

578
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,767
I'll carry these potato sticks.

579
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:42,867
What?

580
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:44,400
Hey!

581
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:49,900
Here you go.

582
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,600
-OK. Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

583
00:42:57,834 --> 00:42:59,467
Don't copy me.

584
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:01,800
You too.

585
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,400
Besides, I thought you wanted premium.
You bought so many of them.

586
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,700
You've got to start with the plain first.

587
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,934
What? That doesn't make any sense at all.

588
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:12,200
-First come, first served.
-Ah! Hey!

589
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:15,900
It's delicious!

590
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,900
What?

591
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,567
You can have half.

592
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,400
I bought it for myself in the first place.

593
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,500
INCOMING
YURI

594
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,300
It's Yuri.

595
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,500
You're not going to answer?

596
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,300
I've got nothing to talk about.

597
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,900
Even if you don't, Yuri might--

598
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,300
Shut up.

599
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Yum.

600
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,400
You're just like an elementary school boy.

601
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:28,900
What?

602
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,934
The kind that teases the girl he likes.

603
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,500
That's not what I meant.

604
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,400
Sorry.

605
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,500
What're you apologizing for?

606
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,400
You're right? Why am I?

607
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,500
Uehara,

608
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,700
you like Yuri, don't you?

609
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,500
Sorry. Go ahead and eat all of them.

610
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,200
I've got to tell Mom about my tests.

611
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,600
Good night.

612
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,567
It's so clear...

613
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:47,500
Uehara... has always liked Yuri.

614
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,300
What the...

615
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,400
Why am I...

616
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:20,700
<i>That day was the first time</i>

617
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,300
<i>I realized
that I might be in love with Uehara.</i>

618
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,400
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
