1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,767
I know you don't realize this,
so I'm going to tell you.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,867
Since we moved in here...

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,667
I...

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,000
have...

5
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,400
been driven crazy by your antics.

6
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:33,400
Huh?

7
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,400
{\an8}You make a mess of this place,
and get me involved in a catfight.

8
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,867
{\an8}And we even have to pretend
like we're dating.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,000
{\an8}On Christmas you came down with a fever
and were bedridden.

10
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,300
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:49,600
And what's more,
you caused a blackout on New Year's Eve.

12
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,767
Now wait a minute here.
I don't have that kind of power--

13
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,200
Trouble just seems to follow you.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,367
Fine, say what you like.

15
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:03,900
But, you know...

16
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,300
it's been a lot of fun.

17
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,367
Huh?

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,100
That's all I have to say.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,967
Does that mean...

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,834
that you enjoy being with me?

21
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,100
Oh! Could this mean...

22
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:31,100
-you actually want us to be a couple?
-Hey.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,700
Just kidding.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,000
It just means
that until you move into a dorm...

25
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't mind you living here.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,500
<i>TOKYO FUN WALK</i>

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,900
<i>SPRING DATE SPOT SPECIAL REPORT</i>

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,600
EVENING STAR RAMEN

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,500
There must be some kind of mistake.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,100
How dare you say something like that.

31
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,000
They're lining up
because they want a taste of our ramen.

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,300
But why all of a sudden?

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,734
This.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,934
"Spring date spot special report."

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,934
I see.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,300
Wow!

37
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,400
EVENING STAR RAMEN

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,867
Huh? Issei?

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,700
That writer is one
of our long-time customers.

40
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,667
I see.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,100
Since that article came out
couples have been lining up like that.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,800
-There's a coupon in there too.
-Really?

43
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:58,600
A ramen date sounds kind of nice.

44
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Really?
Don't women want something fancier,

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
like French or Italian food?

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,400
That's exactly why they like this.

47
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,800
Here you can spend time together
in a more casual way.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,300
I wish I had someone to eat ramen with.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
But I think that a man's true feelings
are for the ramen.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
But doesn't eating together mean

51
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,300
that you can tell each other
your true feelings?

52
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,300
Now I see.

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,934
Man-woman relationships can be very deep.

54
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:29,800
Nao, why don't you come here
for your next date?

55
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:31,700
Here.

56
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,300
If you don't have anyone,
I'll eat with you if you like.

57
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,467
A date...

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,500
<i>Today marks the start of third trimester.</i>

59
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,600
<i>Seniors must face entrance exams...</i>

60
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,300
Aw, jeez. School's already started.

61
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:17,000
I had so many remedial lessons,
I don't feel rested at all.

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh! From tomorrow
I've got to get up earlier to make lunch.

63
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,734
Just buy one at the canteen.
It's a lot easier.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,767
That's far too wasteful, Mitsuishi.

65
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:27,200
It's way cheaper to make one yourself.

66
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,900
This trimester I made up my mind
to make my own lunch.

67
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,400
Then why don't you make enough
for Uehara as well?

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,400
What?

69
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:37,000
If you're making one,
you might as well make enough for two.

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,700
Then you can eat together too!

71
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,200
Lunch with Uehara?

72
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,500
Nah, that'll never happen.

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,200
Since you're supposed to be dating,
eating together won't seem strange.

74
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,700
It'll look natural, in fact.

75
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,900
Yep. If you're dating, that is.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,900
-You can say, "Open wide!"
-Yeah, "Open wide!"

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,567
No way.

78
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,000
Uehara would never eat with me.

79
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:05,700
Sure.

80
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,567
Really?

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,900
-You're going to make lunch for me, right?
-Uh-huh. I will.

82
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,700
Then I'd totally eat it.
Let's eat together.

83
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,000
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

84
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Besides, I'm always hungry.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,567
Yeah, you're right.

86
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,400
Hey!

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,000
Jeez...

88
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,000
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

89
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,200
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
-How many days is that for?
-And how many people?

91
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,700
Uehara is a big eater.

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,667
Yeah, but even so... Well, whatever.

93
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:42,867
-Now listen to me, Nao.
-Huh?

94
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:46,500
You must really play the part
of a lovey-dovey couple well.

95
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,800
-Lovey-dovey?
-Why?

96
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:52,000
The reason why so many actors in dramas
become couples

97
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,200
is because they're playing the part
of being a couple!

98
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,600
-Is that true?
-Nah, that's impossible.

99
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,300
-Shut up, Mitsuishi.
-Yes, ma'am.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,934
Get this, Nao.

101
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:05,300
If you and Uehara play being sweethearts,
then someday you really will become one.

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,500
Understand?

103
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,934
Yes... I'll try my best.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Of course if this will eventually get him
to like me, then I want to try.

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,200
But how should we play the role
of being sweethearts.

106
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:30,066
-Here. Open wide.
-Ahh.

107
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
Yum. It's delicious.

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,900
No way. Never. That'll never happen.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,600
-That's her, Uehara's girl.
-Really?

110
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:47,867
-She's pretty cute, isn't she?
-Who? Who?

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,700
-That girl sitting over there.
-Really?

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
-She's cute, huh?
-Yeah, she is.

113
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,367
Yeah, she is pretty cute.

114
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:54,500
Uh-huh, she sure is.

115
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, that's right!

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Here at school, I'm Uehara's girlfriend.

117
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,400
What are you doing?

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,900
-Oh, Uehara.
-Hurry up and let's eat.

119
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,600
Okay.

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,066
Let's dig in.

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,567
I can do this.

122
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,734
Here, say ahh...

123
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:44,467
-Come on! Here! Open wide.
-What's with you?

124
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,934
You're the one who said we had to act
like we were dating.

125
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,867
Nobody does that when they're dating.

126
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,900
Yes they do! Look!

127
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,967
-Open wide.
-Ahh.

128
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,300
-Do you like it?
-It's delicious.

129
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
I knew you'd like it.
I worked hard to make it.

130
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:04,000
-Thank you.
-Oh, you have something here.

131
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,500
It's rice.

132
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,667
-Give that to me. I'll eat it myself.
-Oh!

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,100
What's with him?

134
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,300
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

135
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,200
Let's do this.

136
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:41,834
-Go ahead.
-What?

137
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
You don't know? Put your head on my knees.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
-Nobody does that!
-Yes they do!

139
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,467
There's something wrong with you.

140
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,200
Did you eat something off the street?

141
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,834
How rude! Who'd eat off the street?

142
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,500
I'm just trying to make it look like

143
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,400
we're a lovey-dovey couple.

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,834
What? You want us to be lovey-dovey?

145
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,900
That's not what I mean.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
It's just that since we're supposed
to look like a couple,

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,567
I thought we should at least try
to make it look like it.

148
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,000
I see.

149
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,800
-Oh, forget it.
-Forget what?

150
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
-I'm leaving.
-Why?

151
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,400
-Clean this up.
-Hey, I haven't eaten...

152
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,900
I haven't eaten the fruits yet.
Let me have the fruits!

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,900
-I'm gonna eat--
-Ah!

154
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,734
-Yeah!
-That was awesome.

155
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,467
You wipe it up, Uehara!

156
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Next game...

157
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,500
You're the one who spilled it.

158
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
-I don't have a handkerchief.
-I don't either.

159
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,600
You've got that. Wipe with it.

160
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,600
Hey! That's my fruit!

161
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,800
Stop!

162
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,000
<i>Give it back!</i>

163
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,400
<i>Hey!</i>

164
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:15,200
-How about going for some tea?
-Why?

165
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,900
Why not?

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
If you want some, then have it at home.

167
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,667
Oh, is that so?

168
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:26,500
-Nao! Uehara!
-Oh, Yuri!

169
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,500
I was just on my way over to your place.

170
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,800
Are you off today?

171
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,800
Kind of.
I took off after doing an interview.

172
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,667
-What did you come here for?
-Why can't I?

173
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,600
I came to bring you souvenirs.

174
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,367
-You mean from Hawaii?
-That's right.

175
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,300
-Ta-da! This too.
-Wow!

176
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,300
I'm going to drop by a friend's,
then I'll be home.

177
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,367
What?

178
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,100
Hey, Uehara.

179
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,900
Bye.

180
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,900
What's with him?
He doesn't even have any friends.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,200
He's just as unfriendly as ever.

182
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,667
<i>-This...
-Wow!</i>

183
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,400
and this...

184
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,400
-and this too.
-Wow!

185
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,900
Look at all this.
Can I really have all of it?

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
-Sure!
-Yes!

187
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,867
Oh, this bikini...

188
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,867
I bought it on a whim,
but I don't look good in it.

189
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,200
Why don't you wear it, Nao?

190
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
-Really? Can I?
-Sure.

191
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,567
I'm so happy.

192
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,500
It's so pretty.

193
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,900
But I wonder if the size is all right.

194
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,800
I wish I were like you, Yuri.

195
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,500
You're so beautiful,
with such a nice figure,

196
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,300
and charming, and a hard worker too.

197
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,000
I can totally see why Uehara likes you.

198
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,400
Oh, Nao! You flatter me!

199
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,000
But I'm serious.
You've got such confidence in yourself.

200
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,467
-I don't have confidence in myself.
-What?

201
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm jealous of you, Nao.

202
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,734
What? Of me?

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,467
You're always trying your hardest.

204
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:10,367
I was like that before I got married.

205
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,800
That may have been the best time
of my life.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,700
Anyway, never mind.

207
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:26,734
But now that you're married,
you can always be with the one you love.

208
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,367
That's what I thought.

209
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:36,900
But the closer we are...
the more anxiety I feel.

210
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,100
I mean, the day we came back
from our honeymoon,

211
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Takuya went right to work
from the airport.

212
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,700
-Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just whining.
-No.

213
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,300
-Let's have some chocolate.
-Okay.

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,967
Oh, Daichi.

215
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,834
-What are these?
-I received these complimentary tickets.

216
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
You've always liked the aquarium, right?

217
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes! I love it!

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,300
-If you're free Sunday, you want to go?
-Really?

219
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
-Yeah. I don't have practice.
- Okay, I'll go.

220
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,000
Is this what you wanted
to talk about the other day?

221
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, uh, yeah... You keep the tickets, Nao.

222
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,300
Okay, I will. Thank you, Daichi.

223
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,734
-Nao.
-Oh, Uehara.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,867
-Oh...
-Hi.

225
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:46,367
You're late.

226
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,800
Did you come to get me?

227
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,000
No, to get lunch.
Break is going to be over soon.

228
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,934
-Fine.
-Hey!

229
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,800
Is that all you can do
after she made that for you?

230
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,734
-What's that got to do with you?
-What's wrong?

231
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,900
I'm sorry, Daichi.

232
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,900
He gets short tempered when he's hungry.

233
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
Wait up.

234
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
-Thank you, Daichi.
-No problem.

235
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,567
Daichi...

236
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,400
She sure seems happy
even though they're just faking it.

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,867
Are you sure you're okay
with things going the way they are?

238
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:37,767
Of course not.

239
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,800
I got these from Daichi.

240
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,900
He said he's going to take me
to the aquarium this Sunday.

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,934
I haven't been there in awhile.

242
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,967
-Do you like the aquarium, Uehara?
-So, Nao...

243
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,767
are you two dating?

244
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:12,800
What? No, of course we're not.

245
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,100
I see.

246
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,600
How could you date a guy
you don't even like?

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,467
It's not really a date.

248
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
I'd never consider going out with someone
if I didn't like them.

249
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,867
What's that supposed to mean?

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,367
You know you still like Yuri,

251
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,767
but you're living with me, right?

252
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,000
It's not like I wanted to.

253
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,100
You didn't want to...

254
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,400
Yeah, I guess you're right.

255
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Gee, I'm sorry that I forced you
to live with me and eat lunch with me.

256
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,700
-That's not what I mean--
-If only I had been Yuri,

257
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,200
it would have been okay, right?

258
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,934
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,734
I'm done.

260
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,367
He must really be angry.

261
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,200
Manager, can I have another serving?

262
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,800
Sure, but this is unusual.

263
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,000
You've not been eating much.

264
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,600
Did you have a fight with that girl?

265
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,100
What on earth am I doing?

266
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,600
Aah!

267
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,600
What am I going to do?

268
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Didn't you sleep well?

269
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,700
No...

270
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
Not really.

271
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,200
-Where's your lunch?
-I overslept.

272
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,867
I see. But you seemed so inspired before.

273
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:45,600
Won't Uehara say anything
if you don't have lunch for him?

274
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,967
I doubt it.

275
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,667
He's probably glad I didn't bring one.

276
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,800
Did you have a fight?

277
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,200
Okay!
I'll buy you anything you want today.

278
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Yes! Only a doctor's son can do that!

279
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Stop saying that.

280
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,100
-I can hardly wait.
-You too?

281
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
-Why? Is there a problem?
-No.

282
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900
-I thought so.
-All right.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
Thanks, you two.

284
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,000
-Let's go.
-Okay.

285
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,200
Here we go.

286
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,100
<i>Oh, it's Uehara.</i>

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,800
He's so handsome!

288
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
<i>He's so much better than the other guys.</i>

289
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,567
<i>What a stud!</i>

290
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,600
-Uehara is buying his lunch again.
-I guess they've broken up.

291
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,500
I never thought he'd stick with that girl
for very long.

292
00:19:56,567 --> 00:20:01,900
That plain Jane is just not a good match
for Uehara.

293
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,066
DAICHI: I'll meet you on Sunday
at nine o'clock. Don't forget the tickets.

294
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,400
<i>How could you date a guy you don't
even like?</i>

295
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,600
I'd never consider going out
with someone if I didn't like them.

296
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:01,200
What business is this of Uehara's anyway?

297
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:09,500
{\an8}Got it. I'm looking forward to it!

298
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,600
ONARIMON STATION

299
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
-Good morning, Daichi.
-Hi.

300
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
You didn't forget the tickets, did you?

301
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,800
Of course not. I'd never forget.

302
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,600
-Okay, let's go.
-Yeah.

303
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,734
I'm looking forward to this.

304
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,367
-It's been awhile.
-Yeah, it has.

305
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,400
-Look, Nao. Tokyo Tower.
-Oh! Look at that.

306
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,467
-It's close.
-We're so close to it.

307
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,467
-Wow!
-Jelly fish.

308
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,700
Aren't they amazing, Daichi?

309
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:11,667
Yeah.

310
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,200
Oh, wow!

311
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,767
Look at these, Daichi.

312
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,700
Wow! They're so cute.
Look how small they are.

313
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
So cute.

314
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,900
Huh?

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?

316
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,867
I can't find my phone.

317
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:40,200
-Really? Did you lose it?
-Where is it?

318
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,200
It's probably at home.

319
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm sure it's all right.

320
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,300
Besides, we were able to meet up okay.

321
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,500
I'll take photos for us.

322
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:54,900
-Good idea. Let's go.
-Yeah.

323
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,900
Look at the penguins.

324
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,100
-They're cute.
-They sure are.

325
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,200
-Look how big their tummies are.
-Their feathers look so soft.

326
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,467
-Oh, capybara.
-Look, capybara.

327
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,300
They're just standing still.

328
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,400
Nao, isn't that a turtle?

329
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,400
-Really? Where?
-There.

330
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:19,600
-It says, "Touch here."
-It's a touch screen.

331
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,934
-Oh, what's this?
-Wow!

332
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,500
-Which one?
-Sunfish.

333
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,700
Okay, sunfish.

334
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,500
Look, look! It's spinning around. Amazing!

335
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,567
It sure is.

336
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,900
She forgot this.

337
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,900
MOM

338
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,800
-How pretty.
-This is beautiful.

339
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,100
-Oh! Take a picture.
-Sure thing.

340
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
-Send it right away.
-Now?

341
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
You always forget, Daichi.

342
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,767
-Okay, okay.
-We'll take a photo for you.

343
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:36,700
How about a souvenir of your date?
$5 per photo.

344
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,000
But this isn't really a date--

345
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,000
-Yes, I'd like one.
-What? You want one?

346
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,900
-What a waste of $5.
-I don't mind.

347
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,100
-Take one with this too, please.
-Certainly.

348
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,734
-Look at the camera, please.
-Say "Cheese."

349
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,600
FROM DAICHI

350
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,767
Oh, no.

351
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,800
MOM

352
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,500
They're so big.

353
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,500
Nao.

354
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,767
Yes?

355
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,900
Are you really looking for a place
to move to?

356
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:38,300
To be honest,
I'm against you living with Uehara.

357
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:43,100
-Daichi...
-Even though you say it's all right,

358
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,500
he's still a guy.

359
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,800
I mean, if something does happen,
then it'll be too late.

360
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Your parents don't know
about it either, right?

361
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,100
Thank you for worrying about me.

362
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,367
But there's no need to worry.

363
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:07,400
There's already someone in his life...

364
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,200
that he likes.

365
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,834
Then why do you make him lunch every day?

366
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, you see...

367
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,667
we're pretending that we're dating...

368
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,100
so nobody finds out we're living together.

369
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,834
You like Uehara, don't you?

370
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,300
If you really do like him,

371
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:34,100
why do you pretend that you're dating?

372
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,300
Why do you let him treat you like that,
when you make his lunch everyday?

373
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,834
He even likes someone else.

374
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,000
Is that really what you want?

375
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:49,467
But I just can't help it.

376
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,200
I like him.

377
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,100
So, I don't mind.

378
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,600
As long as I can be with him.

379
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,567
Maybe, someday...

380
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,734
he'll come to find me attractive.

381
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,400
His feelings just might change, you know.

382
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Yeah, I guess so.

383
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:29,934
Uh-huh.

384
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:35,200
-Then I still have hope.
-What?

385
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,734
I like you.

386
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
I like you, Nao.

387
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,300
Oh, Daichi. Stop joking around.

388
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,734
It's the truth.

389
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I've always liked you, Nao.

390
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,400
I always thought it was enough
if you just smiled at me.

391
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,100
But I'm done thinking like that.

392
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
I don't think that anymore.

393
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,600
-Daichi--
-You don't have to...

394
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
give me an answer now.

395
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:31,467
I just wanted to tell you.

396
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,667
-Can I keep this?
-Why?

397
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:43,300
To commemorate our first date.

398
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,100
Can you get back home alone?

399
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes.

400
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,200
Sorry... but I have to leave now.

401
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,300
Daichi!

402
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,867
I'm looking for someone.

403
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:19,400
I see. Did you lose someone?

404
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,300
Yes, I guess you could say that.

405
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
May I have the name and age.

406
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:28,000
Her name is Nao Yoshikawa.
She's seven... teen.

407
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,700
-Nao Yoshikawa. She's 10? Seven?
-Yes.

408
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,900
-No, 17.
-Seventeen that is.

409
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,300
Seventy.

410
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,500
-Seventeen.
-Yes.

411
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,500
Seventy?

412
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
Uehara!

413
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Nao.

414
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,734
What are you doing?

415
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,066
That's what I should be asking you.

416
00:29:56,567 --> 00:30:01,200
This has been ringing all morning,
so I brought it for you.

417
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Really? You went through all that trouble?

418
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:07,367
It's just that it might be an emergency.

419
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,567
Thank you.

420
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,800
Wow! Look at all these calls.

421
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,567
Sorry, this will take a second.

422
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,200
Hi, Mom? Is something wrong?

423
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,900
<i>Oh, Nao. It's nothing. I figured it out.</i>

424
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,100
What?

425
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
<i>I didn't know how to use the DVR
so I was going to ask you.</i>

426
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,767
That's all it was?
Stop worrying me like that.

427
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,100
<i>Okay, okay. I'm busy, so I've got to go.</i>

428
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,667
What?

429
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,300
Darn her.

430
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,500
Sorry. It was completely trivial.

431
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:55,500
No, it's okay.
It's my fault for panicking over it.

432
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:18,567
Hey... why are you all alone?

433
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
Daichi already went home.

434
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,734
I see.

435
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,600
-Nao.
-Yes?

436
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,500
Wow!

437
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
It's so pretty.

438
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,367
You know what?

439
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:30,200
Today was just like you said.
It was a date.

440
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,734
So you finally figured that out?

441
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,734
You're really slow.

442
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,200
Hey...

443
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
Dim-witted, clumsy and forgetful.

444
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:52,100
How can you call me dim-witted?

445
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,700
-Dim-wit, dim-wit, dim-wit--
-You're so mean!

446
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,367
You're dim-witted, cruel and...
you eat too much!

447
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:33,700
Oh dear!

448
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:41,767
-You want to get something to eat?
-Huh?

449
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:46,100
-But it's right before payday.
-Me too.

450
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:51,867
Oh, right.

451
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,400
EVENING STAR RAMEN COUPON

452
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:58,767
What's this?

453
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,000
-Here you go.
-Oh, it looks delicious.

454
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:09,700
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

455
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,200
It's great.

456
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:17,700
Thanks.

457
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:21,200
How come you never told me you're working
at such a great ramen place?

458
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:24,734
Hey, are you keeping it a secret?

459
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,400
-It's just that...
-See how great she looks.

460
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,100
Hey! Don't!

461
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,500
It suits her perfectly.

462
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,934
-Yeah, it does.
-Issei! No, it doesn't!

463
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,100
Give it back!

464
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,300
-This is totally hilarious.
-No, it's not. Cut it out.

465
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,734
Give it here.

466
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,600
-Let me help.
-It's okay, Nao.

467
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,967
Today you're a customer.

468
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,900
Okay, thank you for the good meal.

469
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,567
-I'm happy for you.
-About what?

470
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,734
You said you wanted
to have a ramen date, right?

471
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
No, that wasn't a date.

472
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:05,500
Don't be shy.

473
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,400
I can pretty much tell
by the way a man eats.

474
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,400
Whether he's is a good guy or not.

475
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,400
He's a real nice one!

476
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,367
I'm serious. It wasn't a date.

477
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
THE NEXT DAY

478
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,567
Who could that be?

479
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
<i>Yes?</i>

480
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,100
-Daichi.
-Good morning.

481
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,767
Let's go to school together.
I want to talk to you about something.

482
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,600
Okay.

483
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,300
I'm sorry about leaving you yesterday.

484
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,300
-It's okay.
-I wanted to apologize.

485
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:53,667
But I have no intention of apologizing
for saying that I like you.

486
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,000
Huh?

487
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,200
I just wanted to say it

488
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,200
and I don't want to take it back.

489
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Daichi, I--

490
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,900
I told you,
you don't have to give me an answer.

491
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,767
You're the one who said
a person's feelings might change, right?

492
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,100
But that was about...

493
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,867
I'm going to become the kind of guy
you're attracted to.

494
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm no longer going
to play the older brother role.

495
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,567
That's all I wanted to say.
I've got to get to morning practice.

496
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
-Want to ride on back?
-What?

497
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,300
See, now you're thinking about it more.

498
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,700
No, I'm not.

499
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,734
Bye.

500
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,000
I mean, I heard they broke up.

501
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,800
They haven't had lunch together
in a while either.

502
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,100
And I heard
that today Nao came to school with Daichi.

503
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,767
Seriously? She sure bounced back fast.

504
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,800
Hey, hey! Listen up! This is just crazy.

505
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,500
-I heard Uehara and Nao broke up.
-No way! Why?

506
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, yeah. I heard they had a big fight.

507
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,300
No, they said Uehara grew tired of Nao.

508
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,900
Oh my god!

509
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,100
Good morning, Uehara.

510
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,400
Morning.

511
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,400
Did you make up with Uehara?

512
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah, I think so.

513
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,567
Then why didn't you bring lunch?

514
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,734
I couldn't go shopping yesterday.

515
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,200
<i>Uehara, is it true you and Nao broke up?</i>

516
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,667
No.

517
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,800
Then how come
she hasn't brought you lunch?

518
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:05,700
Oh, I'm not sure.

519
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,000
If you haven't broken up,
you should tell everyone.

520
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,300
-It only hurts Nao if you don't.
-What am I supposed to say?

521
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,567
I mean, there's all kinds
of crazy rumors flying around.

522
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,000
Rumors?

523
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,200
Like you got sick of her and dumped her.

524
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,367
Or that she was playing you for a fool.

525
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,767
And then there's one
that she was two-timing you with Daichi.

526
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,500
Nao.

527
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:43,700
Yes?

528
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:45,467
We're here to find out the truth.

529
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,734
Is it true you broke up with Uehara?

530
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,100
-Well...
-We want a clear answer.

531
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,900
You don't want any more rumors
about you going around,

532
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,567
like you're a two-timer
or that kind of thing, right?

533
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,100
-I'm going to get Uehara.
-Wait.

534
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,867
But all these awful rumors
make it sound like she's to blame.

535
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:09,300
Why would you want to stay out of it?
How dare you!

536
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,100
But it's not Uehara
that's spreading the rumors.

537
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,500
But since Uehara's involved,
these kinds of rumors spread.

538
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,000
Let go!

539
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,734
Nao.

540
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,200
Oh, Uehara.

541
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,967
I came to get you.

542
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,300
Huh?

543
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,200
Let's walk home together.

544
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,000
I'll take your bag.

545
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,000
Let's go.

546
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,000
I wish he'd do that for me.

547
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,200
Sorry.

548
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:14,834
I guess a lot of bad rumors got started.

549
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,834
I didn't know it was going on.

550
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,367
It's all right. I'm used to it.

551
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,500
You're used to it?

552
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,100
-I'm the one who should apologize.
-Why?

553
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,667
Because I said a pretty callous thing
to you about Yuri.

554
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,767
I should have apologized earlier,
but so many things were happening...

555
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm sorry.

556
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,567
After you said that to me about Yuri,

557
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,000
the reason I couldn't face you,

558
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:58,000
was simply because I was embarrassed.

559
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:01,200
That's not the kind of thing

560
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,500
that would get me angry at you,

561
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,934
or make me want to hurt you.

562
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,500
Besides, I've gotten over her.

563
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,400
You don't need to worry about it.

564
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,300
Really?

565
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,200
Oh, I don't want to talk about this stuff.

566
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:24,967
Listen. Don't ever talk about this again.

567
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:28,000
-But--
-I said, "Don't."

568
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,000
-Okay, here we go.
-Oh, oh, oh.

569
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,500
There.

570
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:55,700
-Ready?
-Yeah.

571
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,500
-Ta-da.
-Wow! It looks delicious.

572
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,367
-Thank you for the meal.
-Okay.

573
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,900
-Let's eat.
-This is great today.

574
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,400
-There's so much.
-Yeah, there's a lot.

575
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,667
I put a lot in.

576
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:13,500
-Look at the carrots.
-Oh, wow.

577
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,800
It took me an hour to cut them like that.

578
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,300
That's way too long.

579
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,500
Yum. This is good.

580
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,100
What's with you? Quit staring.

581
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,834
I can't help it.
It's been awhile since we ate together.

582
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:42,200
Oh, chicken. I don't have any chicken.

583
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:43,400
I'll give you a meatball.

584
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,667
I've got meatballs. I got a lot of them.

585
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:47,400
-Have more meatballs.
-I've got plenty.

586
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,100
The meatballs are more expensive.

587
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,900
Yum. I'm going to have some chicken.

588
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,100
I think it's raining.

589
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,667
-You're right.
-Yeah.

590
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:01,500
I knew something weird would happen
since you're making dinner.

591
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:03,700
What? Why is it my fault?

592
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,800
-Huh?
-Huh?

593
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:12,900
Who could that be?

594
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,767
Yes?

595
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,834
Yuri!

596
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,934
What's wrong? You're soaking wet.

597
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:30,967
Yuri.

598
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:35,300
What happened to you?

599
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,100
Uehara...

600
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,667
I'm getting a divorce.

601
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,400
What?

602
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
