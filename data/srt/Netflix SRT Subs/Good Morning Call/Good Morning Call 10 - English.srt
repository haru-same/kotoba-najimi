1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Thank you.

3
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,767
This is good.

4
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,300
Here.

5
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
My mom gave these to me.

6
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,834
It's good.

7
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,700
She only bought this
because she wants to eat them.

8
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,200
This is so sweet.

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,700
You don't like sweets much,
do you, Daichi?

10
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,300
But you gave me chocolates every year.

11
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,567
That's because if I give you ones
that I want to eat

12
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,934
then I can eat them with you.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,300
I think <i>you</i> ate most of them.

14
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,500
Daichi.

15
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:37,667
Today, I--

16
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:39,100
Don't worry. It's OK.

17
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:44,367
If you don't want to talk about it,
then don't.

18
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,000
You can stay here tonight if you want to.

19
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,400
We've got school tomorrow...

20
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,900
so I'll go back home today.

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,834
Yuri... how are you feeling?

22
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,367
I heard you have a fever.

23
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,700
I thought
you were coming home late tonight.

24
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Listen to me, Yuri.

25
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm feeling tired.

26
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,000
-So we can have dinner out, OK?
-I want to tell you everything.

27
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,600
I'd like to have soba or something.

28
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,700
-Come on, listen.
-I don't want to hear it!

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,300
Hear him out.

30
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,900
You can still divorce him
after you listen to what he has to say.

31
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,834
You stay out of this!

32
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,500
Sorry for not telling you
about my transfer.

33
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,600
I meant to tell you all about it.

34
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,967
-Yeah, right.
-I did. I'm serious.

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,100
How can you talk to
your ex-girlfriend...

36
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,667
but not talk to me about it?

37
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,300
Her husband was transferred
to live alone overseas,

38
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,800
so I wanted to ask her some questions
about it.

39
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:09,767
So?
What if her husband is overseas?

40
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,567
She really has nothing to do with this.
I just...

41
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,400
I just couldn't tell you, that's all.

42
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:20,467
Couldn't tell me what?

43
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,000
I want you to come with me.

44
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,400
I know what you'd say.

45
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,433
You'd say
that you'd throw away your life here

46
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
and come with me.

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,300
-Then why--
-But if you did...

48
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,700
If you did...
you wouldn't be losing just your job...

49
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,400
but our home in Japan too.

50
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't tell me...

51
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,100
you were worried about me
having a place to stay.

52
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,600
I never asked you to do that.

53
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,300
Or maybe

54
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,200
you were going to let me have Yuri?

55
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,667
I knew it. You and your ex-girlfriend
are getting on good.

56
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,500
It only makes sense.

57
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,533
Instead of this crazy drunk,

58
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,700
you'd rather be with a woman
that understands your work--

59
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
-What did you do--
-I told you before.

60
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
I will never let you have Yuri.

61
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,700
Then take her with you!

62
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,233
If we go there,

63
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,000
we won't be able to come back
for three years.

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,734
You'll have to quit your current job,

65
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,100
and we won't be able to see Hisashi.

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
You already know, right?

67
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,734
You know what I'll say.

68
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,300
Oh, sorry.

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,300
Uehara.

70
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,667
Sorry about the trouble I caused you.

71
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,900
Quit being a pussyfoot!

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,467
That's payback.

73
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,000
Nao.

74
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:16,467
Nao.

75
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,700
Nao.

76
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,867
Sorry. I'm going home. Yuri.

77
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,100
So that means
Yuri stayed overnight here?

78
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:23,333
{\an8}UNKNOWN

79
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,967
Hello. This is Yoshikawa Nao.

80
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,000
-Nao.
-Uhm, Uehara...

81
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,300
I just found out there's an opening
at the girls' dorm from next month.

82
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,967
What?

83
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,367
They said I could move right in
at that time.

84
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,600
I didn't expect an opening this soon.

85
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,467
Oh, I see.

86
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,834
That's good news.

87
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:34,767
It's a little sooner than I planned,
but it's OK, right?

88
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Nao,

89
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,100
-about today--
-Sorry...

90
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,800
but I don't want to hear about it.

91
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,467
I'm going to sleep for a while.

92
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,767
<i>-Oh, come on. Cut that out.
-Why?</i>

93
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:30,967
Oh!

94
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,967
Good morning!

95
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,600
-Oh, Marina.
-Good morning.

96
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,600
Good morning.

97
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,834
So, how was your Valentine's date?

98
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,400
Did you tell him?

99
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,400
No.

100
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,967
What? You mean you didn't tell him?

101
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,467
No, it was kind of...

102
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,400
Jeez! You look so depressed.

103
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
-Mitsuishi, you go on ahead.
-Huh? Why?

104
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,800
-Dang, you're cold.
-Just go!

105
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,667
-But we were so lovey-dovey yester--
-Mitsuishi!

106
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
OK.

107
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,100
Nao?

108
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,200
<i>Yuri, huh?</i>

109
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,200
You know,
there may have been a good reason for it.

110
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,400
Like what?

111
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uh, well... Look,

112
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,934
when a friend is truly in trouble,

113
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,600
you'd at least want to listen
to their problem, right?

114
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,000
-But she's not a friend.
-Huh?

115
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,367
Yuri's not just a friend.

116
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,600
I mean, he's always liked her.

117
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,100
But, even though he used to like her,
she's still his sister-in-law.

118
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,033
You wouldn't like it
if he were the type of guy

119
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,500
who was cold and ignored
that kind of thing.

120
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,734
Yeah.

121
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,867
But...

122
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:07,100
what I hate more is seeing Uehara
become all frantic over Yuri.

123
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,200
I hate myself for hating Yuri too.

124
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,967
And I really hate myself
for being so jealous.

125
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,100
I'm going all crazy inside!

126
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:33,100
Nao, why don't you stay at my place
for a while?

127
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,600
I'll listen to you
complain about whatever you like.

128
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
OK?

129
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:47,667
OK.

130
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
What did you want to talk to me about?

131
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:06,800
What's your problem?

132
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,700
I thought you said you told Nao
how you felt about her.

133
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,734
Then how come she was crying?

134
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,567
She was soaking wet,
carefully carrying that cake.

135
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,000
What's wrong with you?

136
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:41,300
Are you even thinking about
Nao's feelings?

137
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,700
If you make a promise, then keep it!

138
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
You got her hopes up
and played with her feelings.

139
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,567
She just giggles and brushes off
whatever you say.

140
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,934
Have you ever thought about her feelings?

141
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,700
No. No way. I won't let you.

142
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
I won't let you have Nao.

143
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:16,300
She's the only one who can decide that.

144
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm not going to back off either.

145
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,600
It's a little late to be saying that.

146
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,100
I knew letting you two live together
was a mistake.

147
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,667
There you are.
Where's Nao's special lunch?

148
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,500
Jeez!

149
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:55,367
I thought I'd be able to get
some leftovers.

150
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,100
So, how was the cake?

151
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,600
You got one from Nao, didn't you?

152
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,867
I totally thought I'd get something
at least from Nao this year, but,

153
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,500
"This year, I'm only giving one
to the person I'm serious about."

154
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,867
That's what she told me.

155
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,500
How was it?
Was Nao's true-love cake good?

156
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,767
-Oh!
-You can have it.

157
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,467
What? Really?

158
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
You haven't had any of it.

159
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:40,667
Nao.

160
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:44,667
Daichi.

161
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,300
Do you have a little time right now?

162
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,400
Sorry, but I've got work today.

163
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
I see.

164
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:57,867
Are you all right?

165
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:03,767
Yeah.

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,500
Nao's going to be staying at my place
from today.

167
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,200
OK.

168
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank you, Daichi.

169
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:16,800
No problem.

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,100
-Bye.
-See you.

171
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,367
OK.

172
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,667
{\an8}EVENING STAR RAMEN, CLOSED

173
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:33,600
What are all these?

174
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,000
They're presents from customers.

175
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,500
-They're all for Issei?
-Yep.

176
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't believe you're popular, Issei.

177
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,100
Hey, I'm called the "Handsome Manager,"
you know!

178
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,100
-Really?
-He takes after me.

179
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:53,333
By the way,
did you meet up with him yesterday?

180
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,734
-Huh?
-Uh... Uehara, is that his name?

181
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,467
-He came here yesterday.
-Really?

182
00:18:58,734 --> 00:18:59,800
He was looking for you.

183
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,200
Sorry, but we're still closed.

184
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,934
Aren't you Nao's...

185
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,100
Has she been here?

186
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
No, today's her day off.

187
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,400
Yeah, I thought so.

188
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:14,834
Thanks.

189
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,734
He was kind of frantic.

190
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,300
Did you give him the cake?

191
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,000
No.

192
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,967
I see.

193
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,967
Things don't always go so smoothly.

194
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,300
I'll be staying over
at another place for a while.

195
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
<i>So, you mean,</i>

196
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:12,200
Uehara went around looking for you?

197
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,734
Yeah, I think so.

198
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't you think you should see him
and talk about it?

199
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,500
You can't keep avoiding him like this,
you know.

200
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,867
There's an opening in the girls' dorm.

201
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Really?

202
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,934
They said I can move in next month.

203
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,100
So you'd move out of your place?

204
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,400
I still haven't given an answer
to the dorm.

205
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:56,467
But we already decided
that we'd only live together

206
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,900
until there was an opening at the dorm.

207
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,734
Besides, I can't keep it secret
from my parents forever.

208
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Is that what you want?

209
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,300
I don't know anymore.

210
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:25,200
He told me that he likes me,
but I don't know if it's true.

211
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,767
What?

212
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,767
It makes me think sometimes...

213
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,500
what if it hadn't been me
that was living with him?

214
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,100
It was just chance
that I was close to Uehara.

215
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,834
But if I hadn't been,

216
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
then he probably wouldn't have
even noticed me.

217
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,700
Then...

218
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,734
I never would have had to go through
falling in love with Uehara.

219
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Nao.

220
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,100
And I never would have had to feel
this way.

221
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:19,100
There's no point in talking like that now.

222
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,800
You've met, and that's that.

223
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
Listen to me.

224
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,700
Chance and fate and all that stuff,

225
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:30,867
that's what love is made of. All of it.

226
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,000
You could go on forever
talking about "what-ifs."

227
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,300
Has it really been nothing but heartbreak?

228
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>You were happy, Nao.</i>

229
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,467
You were happy
when you fell in love with Uehara.

230
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:10,500
I don't want you to regret
falling in love with Uehara.

231
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
OK.

232
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,400
So, you need to tell Uehara

233
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,400
everything you're thinking about.

234
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,867
Even if you do move into the dorm,

235
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,700
it's no good trying to run away from this.

236
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
OK.

237
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,300
{\an8}Oh! Answer it! Answer it!
It might be Uehara.

238
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:01,900
{\an8}DAICHI

239
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
{\an8}Oh, it's Daichi.

240
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,300
Hello?

241
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,300
Sorry about calling you so late.

242
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,000
It's OK.

243
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,600
What's wrong?

244
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,500
You know, Nao, I still like you.

245
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,600
If it were me, I'd never make you cry.

246
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,100
I'd never play with your feelings either.

247
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,100
You know what I thought about
when I saw you crying the other day?

248
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,867
I thought, "I want to be with Nao."

249
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,934
No, that's not it.

250
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,567
I want you to be with me.

251
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,600
When I enter university,
I'm thinking about living on my own.

252
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Really?
You're not going to commute from home?

253
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,600
I changed my mind.

254
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Nao, will you live with me?

255
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,600
I want to live with you, Nao.

256
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,000
Daichi...

257
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,600
Nao.

258
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,200
I want you to think it over
carefully again.

259
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Daichi...

260
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,200
I...

261
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:35,767
I think I might be moving out of there.

262
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,500
Really?

263
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,200
There's an opening at the girls' dorm.

264
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,400
They said I can move in next month.

265
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,000
-Then--
-But...

266
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,600
I'm sorry.

267
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,567
I...

268
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,834
I still like Uehara.

269
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,133
With all my crying,

270
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,100
I caused you a lot of trouble, Daichi.

271
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:20,934
But, I really still do like Uehara.

272
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,934
No matter who he actually likes.

273
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,600
So...

274
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:39,500
I'm sorry.

275
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,934
My second confession of love...

276
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,100
and I get rejected again.

277
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,700
Daichi.

278
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,400
Well, I knew it would happen, though.

279
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,500
What's so great about that guy, anyway?

280
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,500
He's so selfish.

281
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,000
I can't tell what he's thinking at all.

282
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:20,900
And he's mean,

283
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,600
childish,

284
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,200
eats too much

285
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,300
and plays with my feelings all the time.

286
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,600
But, still...

287
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,934
he's kind in a lot of ways too.

288
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,467
OK.

289
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:09,367
Thanks always. From Nao.

290
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,800
This is delicious.

291
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,633
<i>Ow, ow, ow!</i>

292
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,433
What's this all about?

293
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,100
I'm supposed to be having lunch
with Marina.

294
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,500
There's nobody in there!

295
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,033
I feel like I could die
if I don't tell someone this.

296
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,200
What?

297
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,867
I felt like digging a hole
and shouting into it.

298
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:12,834
So what is it?

299
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,867
Daichi confessed his love to Nao.

300
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:21,400
<i>-That's old news.
-You know about it?</i>

301
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,400
-Even though it happened yesterday?
-Huh? Yesterday?

302
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,900
Daichi said to Nao,
"When I graduate, let's live together."

303
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,834
Seriously? And what did Nao say?

304
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,033
-Hey.
-Before I could hear that,

305
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,200
I ran away.

306
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,700
Why did you do that?
Her answer's the important part!

307
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:46,300
If Nao chose Daichi,
what would happen to Uehara?

308
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Uehara would be getting what he deserves.

309
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,400
He broke his Valentine's promise with Nao.

310
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,300
-Really?
-As for me,

311
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,200
I think Daichi is a better match for Nao.

312
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:59,000
But Uehara also likes Nao.

313
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,834
I'm not so sure about that.

314
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,000
It doesn't seem like
he treats her very well.

315
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,400
I like what I just heard.

316
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,934
Let's go, shall we?

317
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,967
I'm getting a really awful feeling
about this.

318
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,600
<i>-What? Seriously?
-Yes, seriously.</i>

319
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:27,467
<i>I heard Daichi asked Nao to live with him.</i>

320
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,500
So it's true about Daichi
and Nao having that kind of relationship.

321
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,533
But don't you feel awful for Uehara?

322
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,667
Yeah, the poor thing.

323
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:36,467
I feel so bad for him.

324
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,900
-Oh, dear.
-Uehara was right there.

325
00:31:56,433 --> 00:32:00,066
Nao. Can we talk with you for a moment?

326
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:02,700
OK.

327
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:06,867
Is it true that you're going to live
with Daichi when he graduates?

328
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,400
How do you know about that?

329
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
What are you talking about?

330
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:13,900
We're not asking you, Marina--

331
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,200
You don't have to answer, Nao.
This is so stupid.

332
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,600
It must be true if you can't deny it.

333
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,667
It's quite a shock.

334
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:23,734
So it was true that you have
that kind of relationship with Daichi.

335
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,600
That means Uehara was just your toy,
right?

336
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,400
That poor Uehara.

337
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,400
I would never--

338
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,500
-You're just sore that we found out.
-That's right. Tell it to us straight!

339
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,567
You're going to choose Daichi, right?

340
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:43,200
There's nothing to say. I just...

341
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,667
<i>It was all my idea.</i>

342
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,834
Daichi.

343
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:54,900
We made it.

344
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,333
Mitsuishi, you went and got him?

345
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
I was worried it would get out of hand.

346
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,867
My love for her is all one-sided.

347
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,934
Don't go bullying Nao for it.

348
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,300
But...

349
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,000
Nao!

350
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,967
-Uehara!
-Uehara!

351
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,200
Come with me.

352
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,600
What do you want with her?

353
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
-It's none of your business.
-It's none of yours either.

354
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
You broke up, didn't--

355
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,667
We didn't break up!

356
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:50,767
Let's go.

357
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:05,000
That was on purpose, wasn't it, Daichi?

358
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,200
Huh?

359
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:09,200
You got Uehara worked up on purpose,
right?

360
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,800
I'm not as unselfish as that.

361
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,967
You know,
they really are a troublesome pair.

362
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
You want to go out with us?

363
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,400
We'll go to karaoke or bowling,
or anything you like.

364
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,934
-Abe will pay for everything.
-Huh?

365
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,133
He's the one who eavesdropped
on you confessing your love.

366
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,400
-Hey!
-No, I wasn't.

367
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,100
I just happened to be there.

368
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:34,300
OK, let's go bowling after karaoke!

369
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,667
We'll do it all!

370
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,834
-Are you serious?
-Abe's paying.

371
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,000
Where did you stay last night?

372
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,200
At Marina's place.

373
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,700
You mean, you were worried about me?

374
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,100
No.

375
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,000
I didn't think so.

376
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,200
It's got nothing to do with you.

377
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:14,900
I'm sorry.

378
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,300
I'm sorry... I didn't keep my promise.

379
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,900
There's nothing between Yuri and me.

380
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,300
She was drunk

381
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:40,467
and was staggering down the street
in a terrible state.

382
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:43,000
I couldn't help but look after her.

383
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,800
She came here only
because she thought you were here.

384
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,734
She and my brother had a good talk
and settled things.

385
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,567
She was drunk.

386
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:05,600
Totally smashed... and threw up.

387
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,767
Did she kiss you?

388
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,500
Is that what you're worried about?

389
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,467
-I can't help it.
-Don't be stupid.

390
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,967
That's no answer!

391
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,200
-Where are you going?
-I'm thirsty.

392
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:36,300
What's this?

393
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,900
Isn't that what you said?

394
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,900
You'd only want this in return.

395
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
{\an8}MILK PUDDING

396
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,100
The cake... was delicious.

397
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:11,600
But it was crushed.

398
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,100
It still tastes the same.

399
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,600
This isn't the kind of thing
you're supposed to give as a present.

400
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,800
There are...

401
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,066
way too many.

402
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,834
Stay right here.

403
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:46,400
Don't go anywhere.

404
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,100
Uehara.

405
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,600
I like you.

406
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
I really like--

407
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,000
I know.

408
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,500
OK.

409
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,467
{\an8}<i>To all graduates and parents,</i>

410
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,066
<i>I want to express my
heartfelt congratulations.</i>

411
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,500
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

412
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,867
Take a picture with me!

413
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,433
-Congratulations, Daichi!
-Congratulations, Daichi!

414
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
-Picture, please.
-Thank you.

415
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:03,767
-Thank you.
-Here, here.

416
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:05,800
Daichi!

417
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,500
-Sorry. I have to go.

418
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:10,800
-Daichi...
-Sorry.

419
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,100
Excuse me.

420
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:19,100
Congratulations on graduating.

421
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,934
Thank you.

422
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:26,500
Nao.

423
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,500
When you've got tests,
start studying ahead of time.

424
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,000
OK.

425
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,567
And eat properly.

426
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,367
OK.

427
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,000
And don't be late.

428
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,200
I know.

429
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
And don't cry anymore.

430
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,834
You know, I won't be around if you do.

431
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,200
OK.

432
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:31,300
Daichi.

433
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,600
Thank you.

434
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Didn't I just tell you not to cry?

435
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,867
I can't help it.

436
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Look who's here.

437
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:51,000
Nao!

438
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,500
Daichi, thanks for all you've done.

439
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:55,600
Thank you.

440
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,033
-You can leave Nao in my hands.
-What are you talking about?

441
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Well, you can leave Marina in my hands.

442
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,100
-You got it.
-Oh, Mitsuishi!

443
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,200
I can't believe Daichi's graduating.

444
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
It was eight years.

445
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,000
My one-sided love for Nao was that long.

446
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,600
What are you laughing about?

447
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:36,300
No... it's nothing.

448
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:44,867
I totally thought
forgetting was impossible.

449
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,900
But I was able to forget
after meeting her.

450
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,400
I was able to forget about someone I loved
for eight years.

451
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,200
Are you encouraging me?

452
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,500
Sorry if I sounded righteous.

453
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:03,600
That kind of pissed me off.

454
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Uehara.

455
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:25,600
Let's go.

456
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,900
OK.

457
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
Dang, I'm hungry.

458
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,200
Hey!

459
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,934
Huh? Ow!

460
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,600
What do you want to eat today?

461
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,000
Hey, quit walking away!

462
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,467
-Come to think of it...
-Huh?

463
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,367
-What happened with that?
-With what?

464
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,200
The girls' dorm.

465
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,867
Oh, about that,

466
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:09,100
I missed my chance to take it,
so they got another person.

467
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:12,900
-Really?
-But that's all right.

468
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,734
You told me
that you didn't want me to go anywhere.

469
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,200
What?

470
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:22,100
-You said that, right?
-No, I didn't.

471
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,767
Yes, you did!

472
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,100
"Stay right here."

473
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:29,400
-You're getting carried away.
-Are you glad?

474
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,000
Are you?

475
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,867
Not really.

476
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,867
You can't be honest, can you?

477
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,300
<i>What do you want for dinner tonight?</i>

478
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,133
-Meat.
-What? Meat again?

479
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,834
-OK, braised beef and potato is fine.
-But that's meat too!

480
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,967
Shabu-shabu would be nice.

481
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,367
And that's meat as well.

482
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:11,400
Dad! Mom!

483
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,600
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
