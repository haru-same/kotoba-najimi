1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,900
Yes?

2
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,500
Nice to meet you. Thank you
for always looking after my brother.

3
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:20,867
Your brother?

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,900
I'm Uehara's older brother, Takuya.

5
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,700
Oh! You're Uehara's big brother?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,100
{\an8}Since Yuri was still asleep,

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,300
{\an8}I think Uehara left already.

9
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:44,100
{\an8}Don't worry. It's my fault
for dropping in all of a sudden.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,567
{\an8}It's OK.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,900
I've been busy with work
since Hisashi came to my place,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,700
so we haven't had a chance to talk.

13
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:54,000
But I was able to take a day off,
and decided to come for a visit.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,734
I see.

15
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:58,500
I agree...

16
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,467
that it's better to talk directly
with Yuri.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
Here you go.

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,800
Thank you.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
This is good.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>I hate to admit it</i>

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
but he is really super handsome.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,567
More than Uehara?

23
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,500
Yep. They're like chalk and cheese.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,400
Chalk...

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,567
Oh, yeah, Nao... is that right?

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Yes.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,734
Here. I hope that you like it.

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, thank you.
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,200
It's my way of saying thank you
for always taking care of Hisashi.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,400
He's quite fortunate to live with someone
as pretty as you.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,834
Oh, no, no... I'm not so...

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This situation is like...

33
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,200
Nao.

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,667
Please look after my younger brother.
Thank you for everything.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,400
Thank you for everything as well.

36
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,667
<i>What are you doing, Nao?</i>

37
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:26,734
Hisashi!

38
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,934
Yikes! Hisashi!

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,800
What's up with you? That's creepy.

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,500
I thought you went back to your home.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,967
I forgot my phone, so I came back for it.

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,900
I thought I told you not to come here.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
But, Hisa!

44
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,000
Hisa?

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,300
I'd like to see where you live and stuff.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Do you have enough money?
Are you sure money isn't tight?

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,700
I'm so worried, I can't help it.

48
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not just your older brother,
but like your parent as well.

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,100
How come you told Yuri your address,
but didn't tell me?

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,400
Aw, shut up.

51
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,867
This is why I didn't want you to know.

52
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,900
Come on, I'm sure you're in a pinch,
aren't you?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
I mean, just look how skinny you've--

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,700
Quit touching me!

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
You know I don't gain weight easily.

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,200
If you eat properly, you'll grow more.

57
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,400
Pipe down!

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Yuri.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,300
From what I've heard,

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
it sounds like you couldn't care
less about me.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,767
Aw, man. What a pain.

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,700
Are you drinking, Yuri?

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,900
Acting like you're Mr. Common Sense,
you traitor!

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now, like I told you several times before,

65
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,000
I haven't betrayed you, Yuri.

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,767
-Just come back--
-Liar!

67
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,200
You met your former girlfriend.

68
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,834
-She's a work acquaintance.
-Work acquaintance?

69
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm in sales for a home builder.

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,667
She is an employee for one of our clients.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,700
Oh, that's it? Yuri, if it's for work--

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,500
You planned a vacation with her,
didn't you?

73
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,700
Huh?

74
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:59,200
The two of you were cozily planning
a vacation abroad.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
That's what you were planning, right?

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Uh...

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,934
Oh...

78
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,000
My friend just happened to see you
and sent it to me.

79
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:12,100
Hey, is that really Takuya?

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,934
This is... me...

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
-Huh? Hey!
-This thing...

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,300
Stop and listen to me, would you!

83
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,900
Hey! Where are you going?

84
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:26,400
Huh? What are you going to do
with your wedding ring?

85
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,400
Excuse me!

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,767
I'm divorcing you! Divorce, you hear!

87
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,300
-Yuri, wait!
-Let go of me!

88
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,100
-No! Don't! Don't!
-Darn you!

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
I will never forgive you!

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
-Ah!
-Ah!

91
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,367
Oh my.

92
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
Anyway, when Yuri calms down,
I'll tell her to return.

93
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,500
-Sorry for all the trouble.
-Just forget about it.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,300
When Yuri gets like that,
there's nothing that can be done.

95
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,500
Yeah.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
That's true, Hisa,

97
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,100
but are you cooking for yourself?

98
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,100
Don't tell me you're eating whatever,
like cup ramen or pizza?

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,734
You've always been like that.

100
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Hisa!

101
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,867
-Leave me alone.
<i>-Hey! Hisa!</i>

102
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:35,500
You're brother really loves you,
doesn't he?

103
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:39,000
It's really annoying.
He's overly obsessive.

104
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,600
Aren't you going back home today?

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,967
Not when things are like this.

106
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,567
I'll start staying here again.

107
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,600
I see.

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
I wonder
if Takuya really did have an affair.

109
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,967
I don't think he's that type.

110
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,967
Divorce! Divorce!

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What a hopeless case.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,667
Does Takuya know?

113
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,200
That you've always liked Yu--

114
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,400
Don't you dare tell him.

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,900
-Huh?
-You saw how he acts toward me.

116
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,467
If he ever found that out,

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm sure he'd tell me to have her.

118
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,100
-But--
-He's always been like that.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,967
If I said I wanted something...

120
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,100
he'd always...

121
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,734
give a silly smile and let me have it.

122
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,467
At any rate, don't you dare tell him.

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,800
<i>Uehara's brother came over?</i>

124
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,300
-Marina!
-Here! Ah.

125
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,600
So, what kind of guy is he?

126
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:14,500
If he's Uehara's big brother,
he must be so totally high level!

127
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Cool type? Fresh faced?
He's going on my handsome list.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
-Do I even exist to you?
-Huh?

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,300
Hmm, he's a nice guy,
but maybe a little flaky.

130
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:26,100
At any rate, he totally loves Uehara.

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,100
But then he hardly seems to know himself.

132
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,400
He's kind of thickheaded.

133
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,800
Which sounds like his brother is...

134
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,200
a male version of Nao?

135
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:41,000
I wonder what Uehara is really thinking
about this.

136
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,200
Huh?

137
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,667
If things don't work out with Yuri
and his brother

138
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,000
I wonder if he'll want her again.

139
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
Are you still worried about that?

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,100
I mean, he's always liked her.

141
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,567
He liked her in a special way.

142
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,900
He said he's gotten over her.

143
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,000
But I'm not sure he really has.

144
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,200
What about the other
of the top three boys?

145
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,000
He's totally truthful about his feelings
with you, right?

146
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah.

147
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:13,800
Oh, could it be that you've become serious
about him since he said he likes you?

148
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,600
No, of course I haven't.

149
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,600
It's just that being with him is getting
more awkward every day.

150
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,500
That's what we mean
by you're getting serious about him.

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Huh?

152
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,700
-Yoshikawa Nao.
-Here!

153
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,100
{\an8}ENGLISH MINI TEST, 32 POINTS

154
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,867
Uh oh.

155
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,967
Her troubled heart
has affected her scores.

156
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,300
-What was her score?
-32.

157
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,200
-That's good for her.
-Mitsuishi!

158
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,400
<i>Nao.</i>

159
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,000
Daichi.

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,400
-What about practice?
-We're off this week.

161
00:08:58,667 --> 00:08:59,934
I see.

162
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
-Uhm, you know.
-Uh...

163
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,734
Oh... Go ahead.

164
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,567
Yuri is still at your place, right?

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,900
Uh-huh.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,900
Actually, Uehara's brother came by.

167
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,400
Seriously? So everything's been settled?

168
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
More like it added fuel to the fire.

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,700
It just makes matters more complicated.

170
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
You know,

171
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,100
this is no time for you to be worrying
over another family's problems.

172
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,667
Finals are coming up pretty soon.
Are you ready?

173
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah, I'll be fine. Just fine.

174
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,734
You're so easy to read.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,834
If you're stuck with your studies,
just give me a call.

176
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,667
I told you I'll be fine.

177
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,400
Do you feel awkward?

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Huh?

179
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,300
When you're with me.

180
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,800
Well, uh...

181
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,500
I guess it's only natural.

182
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,100
Daichi... has your character changed?

183
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:06,867
You think so?

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,900
Uh-huh.

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,367
I think you just didn't know
this side of me.

186
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,200
Huh?

187
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,934
I said I'd wait for you,
but I didn't say I'd wait silently.

188
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,567
Bye.

189
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,934
I've told Nao that I like her.

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh.

191
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:37,867
Yo.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,200
Huh? Isn't that Takuya?

193
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,200
I wonder what he's doing?

194
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,834
The ring!

195
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,400
Hisa! Nao!

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm going to work.

197
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
What? Wait a second!

198
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,400
Hey, Hisa!

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,300
I see you didn't find the ring, did you?

200
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,500
-No, but I'll keep looking.
-OK.

201
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,000
-Come in here.
-Thank you.

202
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,834
Sorry, but Uehara is at work.

203
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,300
What am I apologizing for?

204
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,767
It's OK. I was just glad to see his face.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,567
You really do love your brother,
don't you?

206
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,900
Well,

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,200
it's always been just the two of us
for a long time.

208
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:05,567
You really are against
Uehara living alone, aren't you?

209
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Well, he's not exactly alone, though.

210
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
He's never been much trouble at all.

211
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
He never showed much emotion,
and acted strangely mature.

212
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,200
-A man-brat.
-Huh?

213
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,834
Yuri told me about that.

214
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes, a man-brat.

215
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,367
He always tolerates things
so he wouldn't cause me any worry.

216
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,834
-But--
-Oh, I know.

217
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,000
He is sometimes childish.

218
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,734
And he gets angry so easily.

219
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:41,734
Yeah, but that's what's
so cute about him.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,100
-You think so?
-Yes, of course.

221
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,300
He's desperately trying to be mature,
but his emotions are showing all over.

222
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,300
But he never says a word
when it comes to what's crucial.

223
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,467
That's why I've never thought of
forcing him to come back home.

224
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:02,900
Huh?

225
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,734
He's got his own reasons for doing things.

226
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,100
But I've always had a dream.

227
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:11,767
A dream?

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm a little old to be thinking like this,

229
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,400
but ever since I was a kid

230
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,100
I've always dreamed of living in a house
that I built.

231
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,767
Yuri would be there... and Hisa.

232
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,467
I always thought it'd be nice
if we could live like that someday.

233
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,100
But I don't think
that "someday" will be arriving soon.

234
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,100
Takuya...

235
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,200
Takuya!

236
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,000
I want you to make up with Yuri.

237
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
What?

238
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,300
I mean, you can't let it go on like this.

239
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:52,100
For Uehara as well,
if you two aren't happy,

240
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
you'll never achieve that dream.

241
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,100
Or did you actually have an affair?

242
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,000
No, I didn't!

243
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,600
Like I told you yesterday,
we weren't planning a trip.

244
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,600
It was a business meeting.

245
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,300
She wanted to clear up
the misunderstanding,

246
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,567
so she went and called Yuri.

247
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,000
Then why haven't you explained that
to Yuri?

248
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,200
I did.

249
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,834
But she won't even listen to me.

250
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,734
-Takuya!
-Yes?

251
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,600
I've got an idea. Trust me!

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,900
Here, here, here. Here you go!

253
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Here's your special ramen!

254
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Nao... What's the meaning of this?

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't you worry about it.

256
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,700
This new ramen is on me.

257
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,500
That's not what worries me.

258
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,000
What's <i>he</i> doing here?

259
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,000
You know what they say about a man
and woman eating ramen together.

260
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,667
-They can say what their really thinking.
-That's right.

261
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:53,400
Our place is really popular with couples.

262
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,400
Even when things are all mixed up,
they get straightened out like ramen.

263
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,100
I eat here every day,
but it hasn't helped a bit.

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,300
That's because you're eating alone.
No meaning in that.

265
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,834
That's so stupid.

266
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,567
-Oh, this is delicious.
-This is great!

267
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Manager!

268
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:27,800
Well, since we're here, I guess
I'll listen to what you have to say.

269
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,200
Hey, that'd be perfect for Hisa!

270
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,800
-Huh?
-When is this?

271
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,600
The beginning of next week.

272
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,000
"Ramen eating competition.
Champion eats for free."

273
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,734
Hisa would win for sure,
don't you agree, Yuri...

274
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh!

275
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:48,967
Damn him.
He's so obsessed with his brother.

276
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,834
Yuri!

277
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,467
Uhm, Yuri--

278
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,934
Sorry about that.

279
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,200
I've caused you trouble now too, Nao.

280
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,500
-That doesn't bother me.
-Nao,

281
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:07,100
I know you told me
it's OK to be a fool if you like someone.

282
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,000
But...

283
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
that's not exactly easy either.

284
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,867
Maybe I'll have an affair too.

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
-Huh?
-Yeah, that's what I'll do.

286
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,767
I mean, I've got lots of guy friends.

287
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,934
First I'll contact Onishi.

288
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,734
Ah! Don't do that!

289
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,100
You can't do that.

290
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,467
Having an affair...

291
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,700
That's just plain cruel.

292
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,100
Naturally it would be so to Takuya.

293
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,667
And to this Onishi as well.

294
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,400
And to... Uehara...

295
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,834
Uehara...

296
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,600
has always liked you, Yuri.

297
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,066
But he removed himself from the picture...

298
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,967
so you two could be happy.

299
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,700
So how can you...

300
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,900
how can you say you'll get divorced...
or have an affair so easily?

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
That kind of thing...

302
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,600
would be super cruel to Uehara!

303
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:57,967
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,667
ISSEI

305
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,367
-Go back.
-Huh?

306
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
I won't be having any affair.

307
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,300
-But--
-Don't you worry.

308
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
OK?

309
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:56,000
Thank you... Nao.

310
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,300
COFFEE SHOP

311
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,400
I've told Nao that I like her.

312
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:29,100
Uehara's as sullen as ever again today.

313
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,867
-I wonder if it's about that?
-What?

314
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:36,000
That guy from my class
who came here the other day.

315
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,600
He and I were getting along really well.

316
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,667
Yeah, so?

317
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:42,867
No matter how handsome a guy is,
when he thinks about the girl he likes,

318
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:45,767
you can tell he's in love when he's
happy and anxious at the same time.

319
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,000
Hey!

320
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,567
Hey.

321
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
Hey.

322
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,100
Dad,

323
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,300
how will I get him to forgive me?

324
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,767
Hold on here. Where's today's horoscope?

325
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,500
Uh, let's see. It says to face north.

326
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
Which is north?

327
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,100
<i>Yes?</i>

328
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,700
-Oh.
-Daichi.

329
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:24,567
These are the test sheets from last year.
I thought you could study from them.

330
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,834
Thanks. They'll be a big help.

331
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,500
Sorry that I'm dressed so sloppy.

332
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,967
Huh? Do I look funny?

333
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,400
-No, I'm actually really happy.
-Huh?

334
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,600
I mean, the other day you also
let me see you in that jersey at work.

335
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,367
Oh, well that's--

336
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,967
It seems like you're taking me
more seriously since I said I like you.

337
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,500
That's not what's going on--

338
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,100
What are you doing standing there
at my door?

339
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,467
Why don't you take this opportunity
to clear things up.

340
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,934
Huh?

341
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
What are your feelings?

342
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:05,734
Hey, Daichi.

343
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:07,867
Are you still--

344
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,600
What are your feelings about Yuri now?

345
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,100
You liked her, didn't you?

346
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:31,000
Thanks to Nao,
it looks like you're eating properly.

347
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,600
But also as a way
of saying thanks to you two,

348
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,000
I thought I'd make dinner.

349
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
Hisa will eat anything,

350
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
but he's never liked stew
since he was little.

351
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, I didn't either. I wonder why?

352
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,800
Maybe since it's
so clearly a family dish--

353
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,767
How come you haven't said anything?

354
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,367
Huh?

355
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Could it be... you always knew?

356
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,567
You knew that I always liked Yuri?

357
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,500
Are you even listening?

358
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,300
Look at me!

359
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,000
Not Yuri.

360
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,500
Huh?

361
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,800
Yuri is the one thing
I won't let you have.

362
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,367
Takuya.

363
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,100
Sorry, Hisa.

364
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,834
Wait, Uehara!

365
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,300
<i>Damn you!</i>

366
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,300
Yuri, when did you get here?

367
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,800
Damn you!

368
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:34,834
Uehara.

369
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,000
For eight whole years...

370
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,300
he acted like he didn't know.

371
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
God damn that jerk!

372
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,300
I feel like such an idiot.

373
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
This whole time
I was desperately hiding my feelings.

374
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,400
He didn't let you have her.

375
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,300
What?

376
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,467
He didn't give you a silly smile
and let you have her, right?

377
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,100
That was really admirable of Takuya.

378
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:28,000
He's the kind of big brother you deserve.

379
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,900
Uehara?

380
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,600
-Get me closer.
-You're heavy, you know.

381
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,667
-But I can't see.
-What?

382
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:02,800
-Lift me a little higher.
-I can't go any higher. Ow!

383
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
-Uh, it's not here.
-What?

384
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:09,734
Oh!

385
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,000
-There it is!
-Really?

386
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:17,900
Here it is!

387
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,400
Oh.

388
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,400
Hey, come on. Let me see.

389
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:24,200
Hey, what're you hiding it for? Show me!

390
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,367
-Fine!
-What's with you?

391
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,400
It's just a key ring!

392
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:40,667
Nao?

393
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,100
Daichi.

394
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,567
What are you doing out here?
It's freezing. You'll catch a cold.

395
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,300
-I've got to find a ring.
-A ring?

396
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,700
Yuri's marriage ring.
Uehara's looking for it.

397
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:06,100
But that's got nothing to do with you,
Nao.

398
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:07,967
-You've got tests--
-It matters to me.

399
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,967
It's more important than tests.

400
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,467
I see.

401
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,834
You get back home.

402
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,567
I can't do that.

403
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,600
-I'll keep looking until--
-Go home.

404
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,734
This is...

405
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,800
my responsibility.

406
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,300
Besides, unlike me, you're pretty dumb.

407
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
I won't be having you hate me
because you failed your tests.

408
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,934
What a joke it would be
if you were held back.

409
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,567
My grades aren't that bad.

410
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,200
Besides, if I take remedial lessons,
I won't be held back.

411
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,100
Taking remedial lessons
is a problem itself.

412
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,467
Your problem is
that you never usually study anyway.

413
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,000
Whose fault do you think it is
that I've gotten all wrapped up in this?

414
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,600
Like I said,
forget about this and go home!

415
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:54,500
OK, fine! I <i>will</i> go home!

416
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,500
Are you sure you want me to?

417
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh dear!

418
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,367
Sorry.

419
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:18,200
Jeez! What's wrong with you? You're heavy.

420
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,900
Ow!

421
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
I am not heavy!

422
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,800
I can't believe this.

423
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
Uehara!

424
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,967
Uehara!

425
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:19,100
Here it is!

426
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,400
Here it is! Here it is!

427
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,300
Here it is! Here it is, Uehara!

428
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,300
Uehara!

429
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,867
Here it is! Here it is! We did it, Uehara!

430
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,300
That's dangerous. Give it back to me.

431
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,767
Thank you.

432
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,000
Huh?

433
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,300
Thank you.

434
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,000
-Huh?
-Aw, jeez.

435
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,900
I said, "Thank you."

436
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,300
Huh?

437
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,567
<i>Don't get carried away.</i>

438
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,500
Ow.

439
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,100
Oh, all right. Here, let me see.

440
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,900
Pain, pain, go away!

441
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,600
That made it worse.

442
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:31,000
Welcome back, Hisa.

443
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Thanks.

444
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,200
We're back.

445
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,100
Hey.

446
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,700
What have you two been up to?

447
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,000
Yuri!

448
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,200
Wait a sec. Have you two already made up?

449
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,800
Don't talk like that.

450
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,667
What I want to know is
where you guys have been.

451
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:58,800
Oh!

452
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,100
Don't let her take it off again.

453
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,400
Hisa!

454
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,500
Thank you.

455
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:20,600
Nao.

456
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,567
Thank you.

457
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,800
Thanks for scolding me,
and saying it would be cruel to Uehara.

458
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,300
You're absolutely right.

459
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,900
Yuri.

460
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
What are you talking about?

461
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:38,734
-It's none of your business.
-Why?

462
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,400
-Right?
-Right?

463
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,600
What's that all about?

464
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,567
<i>This is my responsibility.</i>

465
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,100
Hello, Daichi?

466
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,600
Can I meet you somewhere today?

467
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,200
I have something important to tell you.

468
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Here goes.

469
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,100
EVENING STAR RAMEN

470
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,300
<i>-Welcome!
-Sorry.</i>

471
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,300
<i>I couldn't wait, and started without you.</i>

472
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,700
Closer to your house would have been fine.

473
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,667
I don't mind. I like the ramen here.

474
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:40,100
Besides, this place isn't dark or boring.

475
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:41,734
Here you go.

476
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
Thank you, Issei.

477
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,500
Daichi.

478
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,600
I've come to apologize to you today.

479
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
I'm sorry.

480
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,100
Nao?

481
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,567
I...

482
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:11,400
I've taken advantage of your kindness
to me.

483
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,400
I always have.

484
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,000
-Don't worry about that.
-I'm sorry.

485
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Like I said, don't apologize.

486
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You haven't done anything
to apologize for, anyway.

487
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,000
Daichi.

488
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,200
This is really good!

489
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,000
The ramen here really is great, isn't it?

490
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
This is great.

491
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,600
-It's cold.
-It's cold.

492
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,567
Here.

493
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm fine.

494
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:00,967
Oh, OK.

495
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,700
So, I'll see you later.

496
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,700
Yeah.

497
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,100
Don't make that face.

498
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,467
I'm glad that thing
with Yuri has been cleared up now.

499
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,100
See you.

500
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,900
The ring...

501
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm home.

502
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,567
Hey, how's it going?

503
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
Huh? Did you eat already?

504
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,500
Yeah. I'm full.

505
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,834
Oh, I see.

506
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,100
It's all quiet now
without Yuri and Takuya.

507
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,734
Yeah. So, you want to watch some TV?

508
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,200
What do you want for lunch?

509
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,667
Huh? I thought you already ate.

510
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:45,500
Oh, yeah.

511
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,600
But I was just thinking how I'd like
some of the stew Takuya made.

512
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,834
-OK?
-Yeah.

513
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,367
OK, I'll have to heat it up.

514
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:15,767
By the way...

515
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
Yes?

516
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:23,100
Yesterday... Well, I mean...

517
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,300
This thing that's happened...

518
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, I mean, this whole time lately

519
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:31,834
I'm sorry I got you involved.

520
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
I don't mind.

521
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,100
Thanks to you... I've been able to
get over a lot of things.

522
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,100
I mean...

523
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,000
This time it's for real.

524
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,100
Me too.

525
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:11,667
Because of this, I guess you could say
I've learned a lot about myself.

526
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,834
Oh.

527
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,967
I see.

528
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,400
-Uh-huh.
-I'm glad to hear it.

529
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
Thanks.

530
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,734
This stew is delicious.

531
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,500
Yeah.

532
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,567
It's really good.

533
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,600
Uh-huh.

534
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,667
Hello?

535
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Good morning, Nao.

536
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,100
Is Hisa there?
He isn't answering his phone at all.

537
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,900
<i>Takuya,
what are you calling at this time for?</i>

538
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,100
Yuri and I had a long talk

539
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:20,300
<i>and decided that the three of us
would live together.</i>

540
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,300
<i>I believe
good news should be delivered promptly.</i>

541
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:24,867
What?

542
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,600
<i>I'm really sorry for all the trouble
we've caused you, Nao.</i>

543
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,600
-Huh?
-<i>Nao?</i>

544
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Huh? Uh...

545
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:36,667
But isn't this awfully sudden?

546
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:39,100
<i>Don't worry.
We'll keep paying half the rent.</i>

547
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,667
No, that's not the problem.

548
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
<i>Oh, sorry. I've got to move the car.</i>

549
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,600
Hey! Wait!

550
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,667
<i>So what's preventing you?</i>

551
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:02,100
<i>Keep it down. She's still asleep in there.</i>

552
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,100
If you've gotten over it,
then what's the problem?

553
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,600
Do you hate living with us that much?

554
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
That's not what it is.

555
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:11,800
I've got no problems
the way things are now.

556
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,100
What are you talking about?
What about money?

557
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,500
Then send me more.

558
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,200
Are you joking? What a waste of money.

559
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,100
This is close to school.

560
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,900
You never complained
when you lived at our place.

561
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,467
Or could it be...

562
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,200
you have another reason
why you <i>have to</i> live here.

563
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,100
What kind of question is that?

564
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,900
For example...

565
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
you don't want to leave Nao, or something.

566
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
Or that you like Nao?

567
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
What?

568
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:02,000
<i>Today was just like you said.
It was a date.</i>

569
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:07,467
Even though we've only been together
for a short time,

570
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,400
we've already got this in common.

571
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:13,367
<i>Today, this pudding is better than usual.</i>

572
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,300
Do you like her? Do you like Nao?

573
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,100
Yeah, I do.

574
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,600
Did you hear that, Nao?

575
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,600
Yuri!

576
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,834
What? What's going on?

577
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,800
OK, I'm going.

578
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,400
Oh, and you can stay here
for as long as you like, OK?

579
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,767
Besides, we're newlyweds,

580
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,900
so it's best to leave us alone anyway.

581
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,667
Thank you for letting me visit.

582
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:02,100
Hey! Hey, Yuri!

583
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,600
Hey.

584
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Hey.

585
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
-No, I can't.
-Hey!

586
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,000
I can't! I can't!

587
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,967
-What are you doing?
-I can't!

588
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:57,300
-Hey!
-I said I can't!

589
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,600
Hurry up and open up this door.

590
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600

591
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:09,200
{\an8}-It went perfectly!
-Yea!

592
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:11,300
That really went well.

593
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,500
Now I feel like we've returned the favor.

594
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,700
He's pretty settled in already too.

595
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,867
And besides,
Nao was a really big help to me.

596
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,700
Which makes it nice to see that
Nao's feelings finally got through to him.

597
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,200
I'm really glad.

598
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,600
OK, let's go!

599
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:39,867
{\an8}You got it.

600
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:40,900
{\an8}TOUKEN HOME - SYDNEY OFFICE

PROJECT LEADER: TAKUYA

602
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:58,600
Did you... hear what I just said?

603
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Yes.

604
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
It's true.

605
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,500
What?

606
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:48,400
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
