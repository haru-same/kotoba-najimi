1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,000
Yuri.

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
Who the hell do you think I am?

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,367
Oh my God, he kissed me.

4
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,834
Me and Uehara...

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, no...

6
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,200
Hang on,

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,200
he thought I was someone else.

8
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,567
That's it, it's just a mistake.

9
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,500
There's nothing to worry about.

10
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:16,834
No, who am I kidding?

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
It totally worries me.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,734
What should I do?

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,734
My very first kiss...

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Because you kicked me,

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,300
my stomach turned red.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,867
Hey, stay away from me!

17
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey, what's the matter?

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,100
You're the one who did it, you know.

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,934
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,200
What?

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,900
Don't you remember?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,700
Remember what?

23
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,100
If my alarm's going off,
wake me up normally.

24
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,800
-What do you mean <i>normally</i>?
-Are you daft?

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,000
Wake me up gently, OK?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,567
There's no way I can do that?

27
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey, you.

28
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,100
What?

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,834
Don't tell me, after all this time,

30
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,100
you're concerned about living with a boy?

31
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,300
Are you fantasizing about me
making a move on you?

32
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Don't worry.

33
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,934
I have absolutely no interest in you.

34
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,600
Put my bag back the way it was,

35
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,400
and like I said before,
don't talk to me at school.

36
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,800
Now I'm ticked off.

37
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,834
Darn him!

38
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,200
Three meters.

39
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,900
Huh? Where did Uehara go?

40
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,100
Wait! Where am I?

41
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,567
Damn, she's so stupid.

42
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,500
-Good morning.
-Hi.

43
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,867
Is Nao having the day off today?

44
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
I haven't heard anything. Where is she?

45
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,900
Today is my big chance to see Uehara.

46
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, that's today, huh?

47
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Yep!

48
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
What a load of crap.

49
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,200
I got a message from Nao.

50
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,500
{\an8}What does it say?

51
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,000
{\an8}She says "I am lost."

52
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,300
What?

53
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,500
Where am I?

54
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,467
I'm going to be late.

55
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,400
Oh no, it's a dead end.

56
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Help! No!

57
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Help me!

58
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:12,900
I made it.

59
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,200
I had a messed up first kiss from someone

60
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,400
who told me he's not interested in me,

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,300
and I got chased by a dog!

62
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,767
This is all, completely, entirely,

63
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:32,000
Uehara's fault!

64
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Hey! Be quiet in here!

65
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,800
-Yes, Sir!
-You are late.

66
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:38,900
Yes.

67
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm so sorry, please excuse me.

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Aren't you going to eat, Nao?

69
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,767
I think she's run out of energy for today.

70
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,800
You followed unknown roads,
moreover, you have no sense of direction!

71
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:01,600
It's not my fault, it's...

72
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't tell anyone we live together.

73
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,200
Well...

74
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,300
Actually it's all my fault.

75
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,600
Hey, keep your chin up.

76
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:17,100
After this, we have sports with A class!

77
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,000
Joint sports class...

78
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,600
Hey, come on, you two. Perk up!

79
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,900
We can see Uehara who looks so cool!

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,200
I've seen enough. No thanks.

81
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm full.

82
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,900
Come on, Nao, what are you talking about?

83
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,700
-Get out of the way!
-Hey! What the...

84
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,200
-Nao, let's go!
-Huh? Why?

85
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,400
-Quickly now!
-Wait a sec, Marina!

86
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,800
Look at that. It's like a fantasy world.

87
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,000
He's so sharp and cool.

88
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,934
But sometimes, he looks so lonely.

89
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,400
The shop's sold out of curry bread.

90
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Really?

91
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,100
Did you see that?

92
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,900
He's just bummed about the curry--

93
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,600
It must be because he suffered
while growing up.

94
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,200
He is the perfect guy for me.

95
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,300
You know Uehara lost his parents

96
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,834
when he was a kid, right?

97
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm no freeloader you know.

98
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:26,900
So, in conclusion,

99
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:31,000
no matter how many times I see him,

100
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,200
he is the perfect man for me! Uehara!

101
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,834
Well, I don't like him.

102
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,600
-What?
-Oh, nothing, don't worry.

103
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,767
Don't you think he has a girlfriend?

104
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,734
Really? Who told you that?

105
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,300
Huh?

106
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,500
Yuri.

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,500
No, what I meant was that
he must have at least one girlfriend.

108
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,200
I haven't heard that rumor yet,

109
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,000
but I would be so shocked if he has one.

110
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I don't get to see cool guys like him
so often, you know?

111
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,667
I don't know why he's so popular.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,300
He is one of the top three.

113
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
The <i>rules</i> are so tough too.

114
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,500
<i>Rules?</i>

115
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,700
You heard them the other day.

116
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
<i>-Remember?
-I remember but...</i>

117
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,000
<i>The unspoken rules among girls.</i>

118
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,467
Sit.

119
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,867
There are three groups interested in
Uehara at the moment.

120
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>First are the teachers' favorites,</i>

121
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,100
{\an8}<i>the super smart girls.</i>

122
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,900
<i>Next are the really naughty ones,</i>

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,400
{\an8}<i>the outlaw girls.</i>

124
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,700
<i>And the ones that are popular
with the guys,</i>

125
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,200
{\an8}<i>the manager girls.</i>

126
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,867
These three groups decided

127
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:14,700
to manage all interactions with Uehara.

128
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,734
Uehara is for everyone.

129
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,900
If you talk with him or meet with him,

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,300
it can cause big trouble!

131
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,767
He's like a goddamn national treasure.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,867
Yes, national treasure! No touching!

133
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
Hey, shouldn't you be getting ready?

134
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Next lesson is your favorite, right?

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
You're right!

136
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, no! I kissed the national treasure!

137
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,900
So, Marina, which group are you in?

138
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
I'm just one of the majority.

139
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,600
I just hope that Uehara

140
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,367
will approach me on his own.

141
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,367
Yeah, right. Nice imagination!

142
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,200
Mitsuishi!

143
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,100
{\an8}UEHARA

144
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,300
{\an8}-What's up?
-What?

145
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,700
It's nothing.

146
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,100
Nothing at all. I got to go to the toilet.

147
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,900
I have a sore tummy.

148
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,300
-Nao?
-Nao?

149
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
If I get found out...

150
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,967
I'm screwed!

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Hey Uehara, help us out next lesson.

152
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,500
We don't want to lose to class D.

153
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,467
No, I'm going to sleep in the infirmary.

154
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Do you know her?
She's looking right at you.

155
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,400
Nope, no idea.

156
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,867
She's dancing!

157
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Maybe she ate something wrong!

158
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,734
You!

159
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,567
Hey!

160
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,200
I told you to stay away from me!

161
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,800
It's an emergency. Read this!

162
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,300
What?

163
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
Hey, stop it!

164
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,667
Thanks to her, I couldn't play hooky.

165
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,300
YOSHIKAWA

166
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,667
Where did she go?

167
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Hey! Wait!

168
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,700
<i>You've got the wrong sports clothes,
Uehara.</i>

169
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,967
<i>There's no one in the home economics room,
so let's swap there.</i>

170
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,500
It's not me, it's your mistake!

171
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,200
UEHARA

172
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,200
Hey, wait!

173
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,967
Stop it!

174
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,934
UEHARA

175
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
What the hell? Why did you cut it?

176
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,467
Because you wouldn't listen to me.

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Fix it!

178
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,000
What?

179
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,500
I'll give you five minutes.

180
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,000
That's impossible!

181
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,767
It's just a small hole.

182
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,000
It's like wearing a pants
with holes in the knees, see?

183
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,400
This is not the knee, you idiot!

184
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
There's no shirts with a hole here!

185
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,300
You always get pissed off.

186
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,767
What the...

187
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,300
Fine, I'll fix it.

188
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
You are such a pain.

189
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,800
If only you had listened to me...

190
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,500
No, this is your fault,

191
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,000
and who the hell cuts shirts like this?

192
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,767
Can't help it now though.

193
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,000
No one cuts it like this though.

194
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,934
Shut up.

195
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,500
Which needle do I use?

196
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,500
Who cares! Use any of them.

197
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:58,567
I found it.

198
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,500
Not yet?

199
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,100
Don't rush me, OK?

200
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,834
Hurry up. You are a girl, right?

201
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,100
Hey, that's a stereotype!

202
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,867
You were going to sleep
in the infirmary anyway.

203
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,200
That has nothing to do with it.

204
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,600
What a pain in the ass.

205
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,500
What did you say?

206
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,300
No, nothing.

207
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,367
Ouch!

208
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,867
Oh, are you OK?

209
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,834
What the hell? It's no big deal.

210
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:44,500
Hey, come on,

211
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,000
what would you do
if a girl got a scar on her hand?

212
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,200
A girl?

213
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,300
If you're a girl, fix this!

214
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,100
Shut up, I'm doing it now.

215
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,567
-You are taking forever.
-Help me then.

216
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,300
Strike three! Batter out!

217
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,467
{\an8}-Do your best!
-You can do it!

218
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Strike! Batter out!

219
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,367
-Uehara, you're so cool!
-You're awesome!

220
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,467
Don't worry about it, Mitsuichi.

221
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,700
It's only you coming for me, Nao.

222
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,400
-Don't say that, it's not true.
-Yes, it is.

223
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:27,400
-Nao!
-Hi, Daichi.

224
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,066
-Do you have sports class too, Daichi?
-Yeah.

225
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:34,100
Hey, you are holding the bat wrong.

226
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,600
Daichi, can you teach me?

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,900
I want to hit him for a home run!

228
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,767
-At any cost...
-Wow, that's not like you, Nao.

229
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,200
You're all feisty.

230
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,300
I don't like him.

231
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,867
-Just because he's cool,
-You're right.

232
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:56,000
good at sports and doing well in school,

233
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,500
-he thinks he can get away with anything.
-That's right.

234
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,400
The world doesn't revolve around you!

235
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,867
Yeah! Not you!

236
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:07,900
-Hit it!
-I will.

237
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
-Nao, you will hit a home run!
-Yep, I will!

238
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,300
First, this is how you hold the bat.

239
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
OK!

240
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,100
-OK.
-Left hand at the bottom,

241
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
-keep your arms in tight.
-OK.

242
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,600
-See?
-Yeah.

243
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,200
Don't try to hit it with your bat,
use your whole body.

244
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,800
Like a spring, unwind and hit!

245
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:31,934
Strike!

246
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,467
Three Strikes! Batter Out!

247
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:46,300
Game Over!

248
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
What? That's it?

249
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:10,834
Uehara could have gone a bit easy on me.

250
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:28,000
Huh? Where is my uniform?

251
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,567
<i>Yoshikawa.</i>

252
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,300
This was on the hallway floor.
Is it yours?

253
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,100
What? Did you drop your uniform, Nao?

254
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,100
Perhaps... Thank you.

255
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:49,700
Hey, what's wrong with you?

256
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Maybe this is all part of

257
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,667
Yoshikawa's charm?

258
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,700
I'm so jealous of her feminine charms.

259
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:00,900
Looks like Uehara is interested
in you as well.

260
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,567
What? Really?

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,900
No, not at all.

262
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,367
-Bye then.
-See you around.

263
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,900
Milk pudding or milk jelly...

264
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,567
It's so hard to choose between them.

265
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,500
It's such a tough choice.

266
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,300
I love the richness of pudding,

267
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,734
but I also love the smoothness of jelly.

268
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,567
Which do you like better, Marina?

269
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,467
-What are you hiding?
-What?

270
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,700
Whenever you hide things,

271
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,700
you talk a whole bunch of crap,
over and over.

272
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,467
Really?

273
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:50,867
I didn't mean to babble.

274
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,300
Wait, Marina!

275
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,300
Marina, wait!

276
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,967
Now, Marina...

277
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,000
What the hell?

278
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,400
You're living with a boy like this?

279
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,700
It will take a bit to explain, but...

280
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,567
You were hiding it from me too?

281
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:42,900
Sorry.

282
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,200
That's the whole story.

283
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,500
So we're not living together nor dating.

284
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,734
I'm just waiting until a space
is available in the girls dorm.

285
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,967
So, who is it?

286
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,100
What?

287
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,867
The guy you are living with?

288
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,800
Well, it's...

289
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,834
Older, same age? Which one?

290
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:24,100
About the same, I think.

291
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,934
What? Same school? Do I know him?

292
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,200
What? Daichi?

293
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Not him, no.

294
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,900
No, not him.

295
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,500
So, better than him? Worse?

296
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:42,500
Definitely worse...
I mean Daichi is one of the top three.

297
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Well... I'm not sure.

298
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,767
What?

299
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,200
Socially, he's actually above Daichi.

300
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:00,800
Which means that...

301
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,967
It's Uehara!

302
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
Welcome home.

303
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,934
I thought you have part time job today.

304
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,300
I finished early.

305
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:24,300
Oh, I see.

306
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,834
This is my best friend, Marina.

307
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,200
Of all days, why today...

308
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Go.

309
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,600
Darn it all!

310
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,800
Sorry that I kept it a secret.

311
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,300
Nao!

312
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,567
Yes?

313
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,300
This is amazing!

314
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
Sit down, sit down.

315
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,300
This is so amazing.

316
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,200
You can get close
to the incredible Uehara.

317
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,867
If I come to your house,

318
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:35,000
I can meet him anytime, right?

319
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,200
Well, I guess yes,

320
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,100
but he is usually at work, not home.

321
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,767
So, Nao, how do you feel about him?

322
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
About what?

323
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,700
You don't feel anything for Uehara?

324
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,100
Nothing actually.

325
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Really?

326
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,300
Nothing at all.

327
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,734
If that's the case, can you help me?
Please! Set me up with him!

328
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
I guess I can try,

329
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,300
but Uehara is not the guy you think he is.

330
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,600
You're not even listening.

331
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:13,600
Oh, what? Yay!

332
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:16,300
Yay!

333
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:21,600
-See you then.
-OK, see you tomorrow.

334
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,300
I don't understand
why she likes him so much.

335
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,100
Crap, you scared me!

336
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,400
He didn't hear me, did he?

337
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:52,834
Hey!

338
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,800
What are you thinking?

339
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What do you mean?

340
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,500
Living together.
If we get found out, we'll be expelled!

341
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,600
I know--

342
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,100
No, you don't, that's why you brought her!

343
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,500
Listen to me--

344
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,567
Keep her quiet, OK?

345
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Marina's not like that.

346
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,300
-How do you know?
-I just know.

347
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,200
She's been my friend since junior high.

348
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,567
Friend...

349
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,867
What do you mean?

350
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,400
I can't trust her.

351
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,500
What?

352
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,100
Your friends are just like you.
Totally absent minded.

353
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:48,867
Hey, you!

354
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,200
Marina is

355
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,100
totally different from me.

356
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,967
She's serious and strong.
You don't have to worry about her!

357
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,100
You don't even know Marina,
but you say you don't trust her.

358
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,600
That's not fair.

359
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,934
Marina is a friend I trust the most!

360
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,767
What a complete jerk!

361
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,667
<i>I hate you!</i>

362
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,000
MEGUROGAOKA HIGH SCHOOL

363
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,700
What the fuck?

364
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,834
{\an8}Stay away from Uehara Hisashi.

365
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,467
Where are you going?

366
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,667
The toilet.

367
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,100
Yoshikawa, what are you doing?

368
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm so sorry.

369
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,367
Nao, are you OK?

370
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:04,600
Yeah.

371
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Really?

372
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,600
What?

373
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,967
Something's up this morning.

374
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:20,600
You're not yourself.

375
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:21,700
Oh!

376
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,100
Did something happen with Uehara?

377
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,367
No, that's not it.

378
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm just a bit hungry. That's all.

379
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,500
-Really?
-Yes, really.

380
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,367
When you are not smiling,
it really upsets me, you know.

381
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,200
Thanks, Marina.

382
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,300
No problem.

383
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,400
Oh, dear...

384
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:56,600
Yoshikawa, someone's calling for you.

385
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,400
Who?

386
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,934
Uehara. He's waiting in the PE hall.

387
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,934
Really? Thanks.

388
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,600
Maybe she's really popular?

389
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,734
-Well...
-Huh?

390
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,600
Why would he call for me at school?

391
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,700
What did I do wrong this time?

392
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Uehara?

393
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Where is he?

394
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
What?

395
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,000
Sorry, we tricked you.

396
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:55,800
There's no escape, you know.

397
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,667
So, what is it between you and Uehara?

398
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
What?

399
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,734
Stop pretending, spit it out!

400
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,500
Don't pretend that you don't know

401
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,200
the rules about Uehara Hisashi.

402
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,100
Stay away from Uehara Hisashi.

403
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,934
Hey, why are you here, Uehara?

404
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,600
What?

405
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,900
Uehara is for everyone, OK?

406
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You got it?

407
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,900
And you're not really good enough
to fit in with us though.

408
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
She's right.

409
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:48,867
I'm amazed you have the guts
to meet Uehara with that face and body.

410
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,700
<i>Even though he is so cool and perfect,</i>

411
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,567
he has a big scar on his heart.

412
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,400
-That is Uehara.
-Poor Uehara.

413
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,934
But we all are always by his side.

414
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,400
We're kindly watching over him.

415
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,600
That is our reason for living.

416
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,600
-That's right.
-Yep, she's right.

417
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:25,500
He absolutely needs us.

418
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,100
You're so right.

419
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,400
I don't think he needs that.

420
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,834
-Huh?
-Huh?

421
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,600
He's not <i>poor</i> Uehara, you know.

422
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,300
<i>He doesn't need you.</i>

423
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:47,100
Huh? What are you saying?

424
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,100
-Uehara lost his parents--
-I know!

425
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,667
I know that,

426
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,567
but when someone is doing his best,

427
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:02,834
you should say, <i>well done</i>,
not <i>poor you</i>, right?

428
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,700
Your rules are so stupid.

429
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,200
-Huh?
-Huh?

430
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,200
You keep saying you know him

431
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,100
because of his looks and this and that,

432
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,467
but if you really want to get
to know someone,

433
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,700
You should talk, laugh and fight with him.

434
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:30,100
Without doing that, how could you know?

435
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,100
For those who don't even know that,

436
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,867
Uehara won't even express
the slightest interest!

437
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,567
Oh, dear, I said it all.

438
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:02,100
Right, now you've pissed me off.

439
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:04,700
Who the fuck are you?

440
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,700
Fuck off.

441
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,867
-Uehara?
-Uehara?

442
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:43,767
You, you are just so stupid.

443
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,200
What?

444
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,734
She is my girlfriend.

445
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,734
Huh?

446
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,667
When you have a problem, tell me.

447
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,300
-No way...
-You're lying.

448
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,100
Uehara?

449
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,000
Let's go.

450
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,767
Hey...

451
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,934
What?

452
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,000
Why are you doing this?

453
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,934
Me and you--

454
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:43,200
Be quiet. Just walk, OK?

455
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:44,934
OK.

456
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,467
Oh my God!

457
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,367
Nao?

458
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,200
Huh?

459
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,567
No one's looking now, right?

460
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,400
What?

461
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,100
I thought it over again.

462
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,100
I realized pretending to be strangers
was impossible.

463
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:28,300
If we pretend to go out, I have a reason
to go to your house, right?

464
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,400
So, what you're saying is...

465
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,100
Let's pretend to be going out.

466
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:33,867
<i>Pretend?</i>

467
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,667
Oh, sorry, did I get your hopes up?

468
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,200
No, not really.

469
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,567
OK, so you want to really go out then?

470
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,600
Got you!

471
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,467
Well, I've got to go to work. Bye.

472
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,000
Uehara,

473
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:18,967
thank you

474
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,100
for saving me.

475
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:30,900
I'm sorry.

476
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Huh?

477
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,734
About yesterday.

478
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,667
About your friend.

479
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,400
Oh, that... yeah.

480
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,400
Go back quickly or you'll catch a cold!

481
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,667
Okay.

482
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,000
Uehara?

483
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:07,100
Uehara!

484
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Hey, are you OK?

485
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,200
Hey, Uehara...

486
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,734
{\an8}MEGUROGAOKA SAKURA HOSPITAL

487
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,400
Don't worry, he's just tired from work
and not enough sleep.

488
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:36,600
Maybe he was just a bit undernourished.

489
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,834
If he eats properly, and rests
for a few days, he'll be fine.

490
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,200
Thank you so much.

491
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,300
<i>I've gotten in touch with his family too.</i>

492
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,100
Take care.

493
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,867
Uehara?

494
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Oh.

495
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,800
"Oh?" I was really worried about you.

496
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,500
It's because you sleep on the couch.

497
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,100
You're exaggerating, it's nothing.

498
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,800
Nothing?

499
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,300
Right, let's go home.

500
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
What?

501
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:31,000
Hey, take it easy.

502
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,000
I'll be fine if I eat something yummy.

503
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,500
What?

504
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,300
Yuri.

505
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,367
<i>Yuri?</i>

506
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,800
<i>So she's Uehara's girlfriend?</i>

507
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
