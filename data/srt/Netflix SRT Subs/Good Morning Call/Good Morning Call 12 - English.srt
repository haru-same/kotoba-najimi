1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,934
{\an8}You don't have a girlfriend now, right?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,734
{\an8}I heard that your only love is ramen,
and you don't have a girlfriend.

3
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,266
Jeez, what should I do?

4
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,533
{\an8}Hey! What're you doing?

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,967
This here is my girlfriend!

6
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,967
So, I'm sorry, I can't go out with you.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,767
Yow! That's hot!

8
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,000
I put my hand right in the pot!

9
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,266
{\an8}CLOSED FOR PREPARATION

10
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,667
It started about a month ago.

11
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:51,266
Just before closing she... Yukari...

12
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:55,767
I don't know why, but she was crying
while she ate her ramen.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,433
<i>I wanted to cheer her up somehow.</i>

14
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:04,266
<i>So I gave her a free soft-boiled egg.</i>

15
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,333
Here. It's on the house.

16
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:14,934
That's all?

17
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,600
The next day

18
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,700
she said, "Please be my boyfriend."

19
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,800
I turned her down, but she won't give up.

20
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:32,000
But even so, why did you lie like that?

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,967
That's not like you at all, Issei.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,667
But lately Yukari's been
phoning our house,

23
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,000
and waiting for me outside.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,500
She was waiting out front
when we came to prep.

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,367
At prep time? That's 5 a.m.!

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,767
If things get any worse,

27
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,467
I won't be able to concentrate on work.

28
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,834
Then why don't you flat out reject her?

29
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,967
Yeah, that's right, Issei.

30
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,900
It doesn't matter
if she ends up hating you.

31
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:12,433
You've got to keep telling her
until she understands.

32
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,166
Yukari...

33
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,667
she tells me
that our ramen is really delicious.

34
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:27,033
I can't be so cold to a customer
that says good things about our ramen.

35
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,066
Issei!

36
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,500
You are truly my son!
You're the real Evening Star!

37
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,934
Father!

38
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,133
Uhm...

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,767
-Oh, wait.
-Huh?

40
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,433
-I beg you!
-What?

41
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,633
While you're here at the shop...

42
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,834
No, just while Yukari is here,

43
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,800
please act like you're my girlfriend.

44
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:57,900
Please!

45
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,967
Don't do that.

46
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,500
When you bow down to me like that,

47
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,633
it feels so wrong.

48
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,200
Oh, yeah.

49
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,900
You're right.

50
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,500
Huh?

51
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,800
The money you owe
for the broken dishes is $12,000.

52
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,633
Who's letting you secretly pay that off
in installments?

53
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,934
Wait a minute!

54
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,500
That has nothing to do with this!

55
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,600
What are you whispering about?

56
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,934
Oh, nothing.

57
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:40,333
At any rate,
I've already got a proper boyfriend.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,333
I can't deal with you guys.

59
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,367
Hey! Wait for me, Uehara!

60
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:54,667
EVENING STAR

61
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:59,867
You're OK with that, Uehara?

62
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:03,266
I can act the part
of another guy's girlfriend?

63
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,700
I don't care.

64
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:08,467
-You're just faking it, right?
-Well, yeah, but--

65
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:11,333
Anyway, it's really cold. Let's go home!

66
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,066
What's with him?

67
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:19,867
Darn him!

68
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,200
We can't go in now.

69
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,400
I told you, we can't go in now!

70
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,633
-Let's go, Tetsu.
-Yeah, let's.

71
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,333
That's the first time
I've seen a real live kiss.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,367
And right in front of us, too!

73
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,467
Jeez! Who want's to see that?

74
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,600
I guess that's normal.

75
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,700
An elevator is pretty isolated.

76
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,233
You see it all the time in movies.

77
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:26,166
But it's not like I want to kiss here too

78
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,600
just because it's isolated.

79
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,633
What the heck are you mumbling about?

80
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,300
<i>You're supposed to be Issei's girlfriend?</i>

81
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,767
Yeah. And what's worse,

82
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:45,000
Issei tried to blackmail me with
the money I owe for the broken dishes.

83
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,734
But it's just while
that woman's at the shop, right?

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,533
-Yeah.
-What's wrong with that?

85
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Oh, sorry.

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,967
Sheesh! What a pain!

87
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,266
Huh? What is it?

88
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,500
Just because I didn't text him
for a while yesterday, he's all jealous.

89
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,667
From: Mitsuishi
I tried contacting you all day yesterday!

90
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,834
Mitsuishi's worried about you.

91
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,633
It wasn't like a group date!
We were just doing karaoke.

92
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,433
Yeah, some guys were there,
but he's getting way too possessive.

93
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,433
-I wish Uehara were more possessive.
-Huh?

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:32,533
That's so much more boyfriend-like.

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,266
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,800
You're the one with the boyfriend
that everyone wants.

97
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,734
Is he really my boyfriend?

98
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,066
I can't deal with you guys.

99
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,900
Anyway, it's really cold. Let's go home!

100
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,367
-One Miso Ramen!
-OK!

101
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,166
I'll take care of this, Nao.
You get them.

102
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,734
OK.

103
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,367
Here's your water.

104
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,100
I told you,
I came right home after the karaoke.

105
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,166
But you still could have texted me,
right?

106
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,300
Jeez! Quit being so nosy!

107
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,500
I'm not being nosy!

108
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,734
OK, you two! Enough! This is on me.

109
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,333
-Really?
-Thanks!

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,500
Would you two make up already?

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,533
-How is it?
-Yum! Good!

112
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,967
Nao, that woman's been glaring
at you for a while.

113
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,133
Huh?

114
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,500
She's been here since this morning.

115
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,000
Since this morning?

116
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,433
Is that Issei's stalker?

117
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,467
<i>Thanks! That was great!</i>

118
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:07,567
Yeah.

119
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh, you're supposed to
act like the girlfriend--

120
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:13,166
Shh! She'll hear you! She'll hear!

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,367
Dang, what a negative attitude she's got!

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,233
Hey, Nao. Clean up the counter.

123
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,367
Uh... OK.

124
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,600
Oh! Oh!

125
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:48,767
How about... How about some water?

126
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,767
Here's some water.

127
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,967
-You're a liar.
-Huh?

128
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,967
You and Issei aren't a couple.
That's a lie, isn't it?

129
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,533
Oh... No...

130
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,867
No, that's not...

131
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,200
-Issei!
-Yes?

132
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:08,667
Will you go on a date with me tomorrow?

133
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,633
What?

134
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm not giving up
until you go on a date with me.

135
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,033
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,533
I've got a girlfriend.

137
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,200
Isn't that right?

138
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,066
Give it up.
You can't fool me any more.

139
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,600
We're not trying to fool you.

140
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:35,867
If you're going together,
then why aren't you friendlier to her?

141
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,633
Well, uh... because we're working.

142
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,600
Isn't that right, Nao?

143
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,900
Yeah...

144
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:47,533
And you never ever touch each other.

145
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,266
That's not true!

146
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,834
Uh... yeah...

147
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,367
You two don't give off
a lovey-dovey aura at all.

148
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,367
Lovey-dovey aura?

149
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,033
-I love you, Nao!
-Huh?

150
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>When did you two get together?</i>

151
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,867
Nao... you and Issei are...

152
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,500
No, no, we're not, Abe!

153
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes, we are!

154
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,133
Issei!

155
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,166
She's got a boy--

156
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,300
Boy, you sure want to eat curry,
don't you?

157
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,033
But this is a ramen shop.

158
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,500
Here! Have some potstickers!

159
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,467
-Marina, get some soy sauce.
-Here you go!

160
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:32,800
No, there's something fishy going on.
You're hiding something.

161
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,133
No... No, not at all.

162
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,467
At any rate, we really are a couple.

163
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,533
Then prove it to me.

164
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,467
Show me proof that you're lovey-dovey.

165
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,633
Proof?

166
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:51,300
Show me all day tomorrow.

167
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,834
Huh? What do you mean by that?

168
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,433
Huh?
The three of you are going on a date?

169
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,300
Uh-huh.

170
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,600
It just kind of ended up
that the three of us would go together.

171
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,100
Really?

172
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,433
Issei was at a loss for what to do.

173
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,367
So he said if that would satisfy her,
then he'd do it.

174
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,967
Oh, but don't worry, Uehara.

175
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:23,033
We're only doing this to convince Yukari.

176
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:31,734
But... if you really don't want me to go,
I can tell them no.

177
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,667
Go! Go!

178
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,567
Yes!

179
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,667
Huh? Were you saying something?

180
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,967
Forget about it.

181
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,834
I'm taking a bath.

182
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,700
Is he really my boyfriend?

183
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,667
FAKE DATE DAY

184
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,734
<i>Wow, what a nice day!</i>

185
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,166
There's only a slight breeze.
It's perfect date weather.

186
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:08,734
Don't you agree, Nao?

187
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,934
I'm not sure I can do this.

188
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,934
I'm really sorry to make you do this.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
But this will be the end of it.

190
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,667
Just play my girlfriend for today.

191
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:20,633
I know.

192
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,467
I'm here.

193
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,400
Hello.

194
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,166
Thank you for letting me watch you today.

195
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,433
Sure, you're welcome.

196
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,867
Dang, computers are expensive.

197
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,100
This is no time to be casually
flipping through a magazine.

198
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,467
Cut that out, you jerk.

199
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,266
I came here to advise you
as your close friend.

200
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,367
-Since when are you my close friend?
-Ouch!

201
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,333
Listen to me, and don't be too surprised.

202
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:08,200
Nao and the guy Issei she works for...

203
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,333
are dating!

204
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,934
I'm serious! I saw them!

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,166
OK, fine. Now get out of here.

206
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,467
I've got my own work to go to.

207
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,233
-Uehara!
-Crap! I'm going to be late.

208
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,700
Jeez! You handsome guys
sure don't have to worry much.

209
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,133
When Issei put his arm
around Nao like that

210
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,333
it totally ticked me off,
and I'm not even her boyfriend.

211
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,934
What should we ride first?

212
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,967
Probably something scary is best.

213
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,934
Right...

214
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,433
Nao?

215
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,400
Yeah!

216
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,667
Oh, that looks good.

217
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:04,066
Let's ride that. Come on.

218
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,767
I wish I could have come here with Uehara.

219
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,433
-No, not that one.
-Why not?

220
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
It'll be fun.

221
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,934
Can you believe that the three of them
are on a date together?

222
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,333
But why do we have to watch them?

223
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,934
We're doing this for Nao's sake.

224
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,467
How is this for Nao?

225
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:34,133
I'm calling this
Operation Set His Heart on Fire!

226
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,734
-Oh. There they are!
-I brought him.

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
What the heck are you guys
also doing here?

228
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:44,700
We're all making sure
that Nao doesn't do anything foolish.

229
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,900
This is dumb.
Don't you have anything better to do?

230
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,567
Aah! Uehara! Have a look! Have a look!

231
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,834
-Huh?
-Look! Look! Look!

232
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,433
Hide!

233
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,066
She's supposed to be acting,

234
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,133
but that's going too far.

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,567
I'm so worried about her.

236
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,800
As her best friend, I'm concerned.

237
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,667
What if things escalate
between those two?

238
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,633
Just let go of everything
and have a great time today, OK?

239
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:28,533
-I'm not sure I can.
-Don't you like this kind of ride?

240
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,600
Yes, I do. It's just that...

241
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,367
Something is giving me a chill.

242
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,066
Oh, no. I'm scared, Uehara.

243
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,900
Get your hands off me, jerk.

244
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:53,300
I feel so guilty that it seems like
I can hear Uehara's voice.

245
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,300
You got his approval, right?

246
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,333
-Yeah, but...
-Uehara!

247
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,567
I just don't feel right about it.

248
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:01,700
{\an8}With all these couples here,

249
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,967
{\an8}it makes me think about Uehara.
I wish he were here.

250
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:16,367
-That was a real surprise.
-It sure was.

251
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,700
-That was more fun than I expected.
-Yeah, it was.

252
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:24,567
-This is too much.
-It's only a merry-go-round, Issei!

253
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:26,967
Have they always gone this fast?

254
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,633
-Look how much it's going up and down!
-It sure is.

255
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,367
Oh! Mount Fuji!

256
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:37,066
Hey, look, Yukari!
You can see Mount Fuji!

257
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,900
-Fuji's totally gigantic!
-It's huge!

258
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,333
Look! Can you see it?

259
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,767
-It sure is pretty.
-Wow!

260
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:45,934
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

261
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:55,266
Hey, this is so much fun!
How come you're not riding it?

262
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,333
See!

263
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,333
She's totally gotten into it now.

264
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,967
Look, Uehara!
What cool french fries!

265
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,033
Shut up!

266
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,867
Very nice. It seems
his heart's starting to catch fire.

267
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,300
That's kind of cruel, you know.

268
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,233
Who cares. I'm doing this for Nao.

269
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,033
<i>You're terrible at this.</i>

270
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:54,967
<i>You're pretty bad too.</i>

271
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,300
Wait, Issei! Wait!

272
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,100
I haven't been to an amusement park
in a while. It sure is fun!

273
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,133
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

274
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,467
-Doing this is nice once in a while.
-It is!

275
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,333
-Oh!
-What?

276
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,100
Next let's do something
that you want to do, Yukari.

277
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,633
I don't really care. Anything is fine.

278
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:22,367
Oh, come on. Since you're here,
you may as well have fun.

279
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:29,767
Or, maybe,
you've become convinced about us?

280
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,266
Oh, yeah. That's right.

281
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,467
I was just plain having a good time.

282
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:36,934
Yukari,

283
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:40,667
I would hope that you could still be
a regular customer

284
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,100
-like you have been, and--
-I'm not convinced!

285
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:48,200
I still don't believe
that you're a couple.

286
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:49,100
Yukari--

287
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,300
You want me to choose the next ride,
right?

288
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,033
Uh-huh.

289
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,600
I've decided what I want to do.

290
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,133
Which one?

291
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,934
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

292
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,734
Open the door! Come on! Open the door!

293
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,667
JIKYU GENERAL HOSPITAL

294
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,633
I can't take this!

295
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,567
No! No! Go away!

296
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,667
Uhm, is the exit this way?

297
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,400
Uh, this sure must be hard work.

298
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,333
By the way, my name is Abe Jun.

299
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,900
Everybody calls me Abe--

300
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:08,500
Jeez, Abe! Let's get going!
Sorry about that.

301
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,033
How can you hit on girls
in a place like this?

302
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,633
Jeez! That scared me!

303
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,133
How's this job?

304
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,367
I can't take any more of this.

305
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,867
I can even hear Marina's voice.

306
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,867
I must be hearing phantoms.

307
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,633
I'm so afraid, I'm losing my mind.

308
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,300
I want to go home!

309
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,433
-What are you doing there?
-No! Leave me alone!

310
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,266
Quit screaming! It's me!

311
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,333
-Look! Look!
-I'm scared.

312
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,066
It's me! Look!

313
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,133
Uehara... Why are you here?

314
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,667
I could ask you the same.
Why are you alone?

315
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,000
I so wanted to be with you.

316
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,567
Let's go.

317
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,967
Come with me.

318
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,767
OK.

319
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,100
JIKYU GENERAL HOSPITAL

320
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,633
Nao!

321
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,233
Huh?

322
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,166
What are all you guys doing here?

323
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:02,533
Well, to tell you the truth,
I happened to receive some tickets.

324
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
But we didn't want to interfere.
Right, Mitsuishi?

325
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,667
Yeah. We didn't say anything,
and did different stuff.

326
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:11,900
Who's this good-looking guy?

327
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:18,467
Oh, uh... Uehara, he's...

328
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,367
He's a classmate. A classmate!

329
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,200
-We're all Nao's classmates.
-That's right.

330
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,333
I see.

331
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,967
By the way,

332
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:34,100
-there's another great ride.
-What's that?

333
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,200
The Ferris wheel here
has these four gondolas

334
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:40,033
that are completely see-through.

335
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,800
Wow! Cool!

336
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,500
And there's this rumor

337
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,834
that if a couple rides in one of those
and kisses at the very top,

338
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,767
-they'll be happy forever!
-Yeah!

339
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,266
Really?

340
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,900
That's so stupid. I'm going home.

341
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,266
Come closer.

342
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,467
Uehara.

343
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:10,066
Nao.

344
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,200
I want to ride that.

345
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,033
What?

346
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,066
I really want to ride that!

347
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,834
{\an8}TRANSPARENT GONDOLAS

348
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:42,066
Even though I said that,
it's still going to be three of us.

349
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:49,400
I'll hold back Yukari and Issei.

350
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,967
-Then you jump on with Uehara.
-What?

351
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,300
I'll let you and him have
the see-through one.

352
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,166
Get a kiss at the top! You can do it!

353
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,533
{\an8}LOVER'S HOT SPOT
FERRIS WHEEL

354
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,367
Marina.

355
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:10,700
It'll work out. Uehara wants it too.

356
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,834
I know you're on the same wavelength.

357
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,467
OK.

358
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,133
Ready? Let's do this.

359
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,500
Ready... Go!

360
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,300
Issei!

361
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,400
Nao!

362
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,600
Marina.

363
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,667
Uehara!

364
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,133
<i>-Let's get on, Issei.
-You must be kidding!</i>

365
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,667
{\an8}<i>OK, Uehara and me ride together.</i>

366
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,066
{\an8}<i>Get your hands off me, you creep.</i>

367
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,700
<i>Ouch!</i>

368
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,934
{\an8}<i>-I mean...
-Stop it!</i>

369
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,400
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

370
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,433
<i>Come on! You're holding up the line!</i>

371
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:16,100
What the... Why am I all alone in here?

372
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,433
Where's Nao?

373
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,834
Things got all messed up.

374
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:30,867
<i>What the... How did it end up like that?</i>

375
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:33,867
Just forget about it, would you?

376
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,233
How can you talk like that?

377
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,166
I mean,
you don't have to go to all this trouble.

378
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,734
Things will work out between Nao
and Uehara if you leave them alone.

379
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm not doing this... just for Nao.

380
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,333
Huh?

381
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,500
We need a chance to make up too.

382
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
Mitsuishi...

383
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,800
you can see what's going on with others,

384
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:18,200
but you can't tell when things are wrong
with yourself.

385
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,533
Wow! Oh my god!

386
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,533
Marina and Mitsuishi are...

387
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,667
kissing in the gondola!

388
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:44,667
They got there first.

389
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,800
We ended up as an odd pair, didn't we?

390
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,033
Sorry.

391
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:04,300
No, it's all right.

392
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,100
It's actually been
a really fun day today.

393
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,633
Uhm, Yukari.

394
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,467
Why do you like Issei so much?

395
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,934
Well, I mean...

396
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:27,166
I don't really know you,

397
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:31,967
but you don't look like
the super aggressive type.

398
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,800
Because he smiled at me.

399
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:39,567
Huh?

400
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:44,166
I've never been able to smile much.

401
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:49,500
I was always alone, even in university.

402
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:53,600
One day, I got my courage up
and went to a group blind date.

403
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,934
But I couldn't join the conversation.

404
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:04,500
Everybody would stare at me,
but act like they weren't.

405
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,633
Then on my way home...

406
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,900
Here. It's on the house.

407
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,834
Your reward for working hard today.

408
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,166
<i>At that time</i>

409
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,266
it felt like...

410
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,867
Issei was the only person
who appreciated me for who I am.

411
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:37,900
So I began to wish
that I could spend more time with him.

412
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:44,567
I know it was really
out of place for me to do that.

413
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:45,834
No, that's not true!

414
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,700
This is what Issei told me.

415
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,400
"Yukari said good things
about our ramen."

416
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:02,066
You've encouraged Issei, Yukari.

417
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,400
I know that his smile was
just a smile for a customer.

418
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,934
-That's not true.
-I'm convinced.

419
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:15,033
I've been convinced about you two
for a while.

420
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:16,533
Huh?

421
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:21,100
I was just being spiteful.

422
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:27,467
After being with you all day today,
I understand now.

423
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,834
If you can make Issei smile like that...

424
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,567
then I have to give up.

425
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,567
Yukari...

426
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:49,900
<i>Sorry about</i>

427
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,233
borrowing Nao today.

428
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,633
It's OK. She owes a lot to you.

429
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,133
But I bet it ticks you off, doesn't it?

430
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:00,867
Not really.

431
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:03,834
You're OK with it?

432
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,166
Yeah, I am.

433
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,166
How can you be?

434
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,433
It's not really my place to say this,

435
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,934
but when you act all cool like this,

436
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,633
it makes her feel anxious about you.

437
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:29,533
She's always smiling.

438
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,166
Huh?

439
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,934
She also gets angry easily,

440
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,333
and cries easily too.

441
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:42,500
But she always ends up
with a smile on her face.

442
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:48,467
Her emotions keep her pretty busy.

443
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
I think that's what's so great about her.

444
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

445
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,333
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,800
Maybe I didn't have to worry.

447
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,834
It feels to me now like she
and I are family.

448
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,166
When she first came to our shop,
she was totally hopeless.

449
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,433
Every day she broke dishes
and confused orders.

450
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:27,033
But she told me that she couldn't
let her parents find out,

451
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,500
and she worked her butt off every day.

452
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,934
You know,
Nao has a kind of mysterious power.

453
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:46,834
I lied.

454
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,400
-I lied to you.
-Huh?

455
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:55,700
I'm <i>not</i> OK with this!

456
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,300
Jeez, dude.

457
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,166
Oh, Marina
and Mitsuishi said they're going home.

458
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,533
They were really lovey-dovey.

459
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,934
-Why don't we go home too?
-OK.

460
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,900
I'll leave you guys here.

461
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,567
I'll say bye to you now.

462
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:26,900
I like Evening Star ramen, but...

463
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:33,300
I won't go there again
until I can get over you, Issei.

464
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,767
Yukari--

465
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,700
Thank you for everything today.

466
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,800
Thank you for all the good food
you've made for me.

467
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,533
Wait, Yukari!

468
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,567
I can't let it end like this.

469
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,367
Nao.

470
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:07,433
Yukari has been very frank about
how much she likes you, Issei.

471
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,567
So you need to be frank with her too.

472
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,367
What are you talking about?

473
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,433
I'm very sorry, Yukari.

474
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,200
I...

475
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,667
I'm sorry!

476
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,767
I lied to you.

477
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,066
To tell you the truth...

478
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,533
she's not my girlfriend at all.

479
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,033
I didn't want to hurt you, Yukari.

480
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,200
So I made this all up.

481
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,667
But I know that was way more cruel.

482
00:33:56,233 --> 00:34:00,367
I'm terribly sorry, Yukari.

483
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,033
You see, Yukari--

484
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,734
That's enough.

485
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,367
-Huh?
-They need to settle this on their own.

486
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,400
-But--
-This has nothing to do with us now.

487
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:20,834
"Us"?

488
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,767
Hey! Wait!

489
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,800
Sorry, Issei and Yukari!

490
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,734
Wait! Wait! Yukari!

491
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:33,567
I'm really glad
I was able to talk with you.

492
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:36,467
I mean it. Really!

493
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,700
I understand what you're telling me...

494
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,100
but it still doesn't make sense.

495
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,734
Everything is my fault.

496
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,200
I forced her to do this.

497
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,734
That's not what I mean.

498
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,333
Were you actually acting?

499
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,166
Huh?

500
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:14,066
Are you sure you really have no feelings
for Nao?

501
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,867
Well, I mean, she's got Uehara.

502
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,100
And besides, to me,
she's just a co-worker.

503
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:28,066
Let's face it, ramen is my only love.

504
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:31,467
Or to put it another way,
ramen is my girlfriend.

505
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,400
So, you won't even acknowledge it
yourself, huh?

506
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,233
Huh?

507
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:47,600
Nothing.

508
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,600
I thought you were
more of a man than that, Issei.

509
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:55,800
What?

510
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,200
Good bye.

511
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,967
Huh? Hold on!

512
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,967
What's that all about?

513
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,300
-Issei.
-Huh?

514
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:12,700
-Oh, it's just you.
-Did you just get dumped by your stalker?

515
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,400
No!

516
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,633
Where the hell were you, anyway?

517
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,433
-Let me tell you what happened to me.
-Huh?

518
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,567
I was just... dumped by a ghost.

519
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,000
-What?
-Oh, I have an idea!

520
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:32,233
How about you and me swap sob stories?

521
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,066
Hey! I did not just get dumped!

522
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,100
-Yes you did.
-Shut up, you jerk.

523
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,166
What are you grinning about.
It's creeping me out.

524
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:49,066
Well, you came and found me.

525
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,133
Found you?

526
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,133
When I first met you,

527
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,433
I could never tell
what you were thinking.

528
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,600
You would never
pay attention to me either.

529
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,567
But to me at the time, that was enough.

530
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:05,934
In fact, it's like a miracle to me
that we've ended up like this.

531
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,200
So I've decided to enjoy myself now,
no matter what happens.

532
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,166
You sure are on top of the world.

533
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,600
Also, I was really happy today.

534
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:15,867
About what?

535
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,333
Because you found me in the dark
at the haunted house.

536
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,033
It was like you could sense me,
and feel my presence.

537
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
That's how you found me, right?

538
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,367
Oh, you!

539
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,700
Hey... Wait!

540
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,600
It sure is taking long.

541
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,133
Nao.

542
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,400
Huh?

543
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,300
I want you to quit.

544
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,900
What?

545
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,433
Quit that job.

546
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,834
Why?

547
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
You can get a job somewhere else.

548
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,200
Like a cafe with just women.

549
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,333
What's with you?

550
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,700
I was...

551
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:30,433
I was just thinking
how boyfriend-like that was.

552
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,333
You're goofy.

553
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,367
Hold the elevator!

554
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:38,834
Sorry. Let me squeeze in here.

555
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:43,767
Sorry.

556
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:05,333
Young people these days.

557
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,467
{\an8}CLOSE

558
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,567
THREE WEEKS LATER
THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR

559
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,433
I'm so happy that I can hardly stand it!

560
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,934
I never thought I'd be with you
and Mitsuishi our senior year too.

561
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,166
I'm so happy!

562
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm super happy too!

563
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:34,667
We can complain about our boyfriends
every day now.

564
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:36,533
Then wouldn't it be better
if I wasn't here?

565
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,567
Hey! I'm with you guys this year too!

566
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,633
Oh, but Uehara is still
in a different class.

567
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,333
Yeah, but I'm perfectly fine with that.

568
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,433
He promised to be with me at lunch
and when we go home.

569
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,734
You're acting like you've got it made.

570
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,500
Did you two get closer over spring break?

571
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,100
Yeah, I guess.

572
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,500
<i>Is Yoshikawa Nao in here?</i>

573
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,533
-Do you know her, Nao?
-No.

574
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:10,867
I've never seen her before,
but she's a real cutie.

575
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,000
She sure looks pissed off though.

576
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:14,767
Huh?

577
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,767
Do you know who Yoshikawa Nao is?

578
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,367
That's her over there.

579
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,467
What's going on?

580
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,734
-Oh, she's coming!
-She's coming over here!

581
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:32,467
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

582
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,266
Are you Yoshikawa Nao?

583
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,166
Yes.

584
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:42,467
Come with me for a minute.

585
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:48,433
"Come with me"?

586
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,967
I'm Kitaura Nozomi.

587
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:02,100
Kitaura?

588
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,500
I transferred in here this spring.

589
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:08,633
Oh... you're a transfer student.

590
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,066
No wonder I've never seen you.

591
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:17,200
So,
what did you want to talk to me about?

592
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:23,667
Is it true...

593
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
that you're dating Uehara Hisashi?

594
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,567
Huh?

595
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:37,066
Uh... well...

596
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:07,767
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
