1
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:13,533
Wow! This is so beautiful!

2
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,133
What?

3
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,700
Quit staring at me like that.

4
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,300
Sorry.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,166
Huh?

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,667
It's just that you're
a thousand times more beautiful.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, Uehara.

8
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,400
Ow!

9
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:00,900
Huh? Where'd Uehara go?

10
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,533
What a handsome guy!

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,934
I forgot how popular Uehara is.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,533
Oh, my god! You're so good looking!

13
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,166
Excuse me! Excuse me!

14
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,133
{\an8}Hey! What are you doing?

15
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,300
{\an8}-Are you OK?
-Huh?

16
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,667
{\an8}I'm just fine.

17
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,166
You were the one who was in trouble.

18
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,433
What?

19
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:35,200
-So, where to?
-Huh?

20
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:36,967
Where do you want to go?

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,633
KISHIGON FOOT SPA

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,033
You still haven't decided?

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,567
Hmm, this place is nice too.

24
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,800
But I don't want to miss this either.

25
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,433
Just choose one.

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,400
Why?

27
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:56,333
You can't go everywhere
when we don't have much time.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,767
But...

29
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,133
We can come again.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,600
Huh?

31
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,400
What?

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,800
Nothing.

33
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:13,266
Yeah, you're right.

34
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:19,066
We can come again... just the two of us.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,700
Okay, let's go here!

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,567
I wanted to go here no matter what.

37
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,367
At this shrine,

38
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,567
they have these wooden votive plaques,
that grant eternal love for a couple.

39
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,734
Really?

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,934
I'm buying one for sure.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,266
Dang, these stairs are steep.

42
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,200
Yeah. Votive plaque! Votive plaque!

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,400
PRAY FOR LOVE
ROMANCE FULFILLMENT VOTIVE PLAQUES

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,700
I'd like one of your
romance fulfillment votive plaques.

45
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,700
Make it two!

46
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:22,900
No, ten, please!

47
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,967
What are you thinking?
You don't need that many.

48
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,266
I want enough to last all eternity.

49
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,367
-What?
-Uhm...

50
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,600
I'm terribly sorry,

51
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,200
but the votive plaques just sold out.

52
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,533
-Huh?
-Another customer wanted all that we had.

53
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,533
Someone just like you.

54
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,100
I can't believe it.

55
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh! There you guys are!

56
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,033
So, how did it go?
Are you two getting closer?

57
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,333
Our future together is unclear.

58
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,233
Oh! Hey, you guys!

59
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,467
Huh? Kitaura, you're here?

60
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,967
We met by chance
and wanted to go to all the same places!

61
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,633
You just followed me around!

62
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,633
It must be thanks to these.
I'm glad I bought them all.

63
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,233
Hey! Those are the votive plaques!

64
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,967
You mean you're the one
who bought them all?

65
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,900
Yeah.

66
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,734
Aw, come on! Give me one!

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,767
-Give me one!
-Why?

68
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,867
-Give me one!
-No way!

69
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,834
I guess we're all here.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,266
-You can't use that many!
-There are only five!

71
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,033
Oh, Kitaura.
They said we could add you to our room.

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,934
Why?

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,734
"Why?"
But, I thought you were all friends.

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,633
No.

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,133
Uehara just happened to give me--

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Oh, by the way...

77
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,667
Keep quiet about that.

78
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:23,734
Right?

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,367
So, those tickets were yours,

80
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,367
but you want to protect her so much,
that you gave them to me.

81
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,467
I like knowing your weakness.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,700
Okay, I'll take you up on your offer
and stay with you guys.

83
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,567
I'm looking forward to it, Nao.

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,333
Me too.

85
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,133
Hey! Wait for me!

86
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,133
Yea! Look at this! Come on!

87
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,700
The Mejiro room is for the men.

88
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:13,200
The ladies will stay in the Tsugumi room
on the second floor.

89
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,734
Okay. Thank you.

90
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,200
What? You mean we're not together
in the same room?

91
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,500
Young guys and girls in the same room?
Are you nuts?

92
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,100
I made sure they separated us.

93
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,200
I thought I was going to have a chance
to hit it off with Kitaura.

94
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,567
Oh!

95
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,300
There's a place nearby
for fulfilling romantic hopes.

96
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,333
-Really?
-Really?

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,166
The legend is related
to those votive plaques that you have.

98
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,934
It's called Tragic Lovers Hill.

99
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,967
"It became known to help in achieving
a successful romance."

100
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,800
Please tell us all about it!

101
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,633
-Of course.
-So, tell us!

102
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,967
But the two of them died
without ever consummating their love.

103
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,066
The villagers felt so sorry for them

104
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,500
that they built Tragic Lovers Hill.

105
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,033
-Or so I've heard.
-What do you mean by that?

106
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,133
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,367
I've only been the hostess of this inn
for a short while.

108
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,867
But I've also heard that a lot of couples

109
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,567
that go up that hill, have had their
romantic wishes fulfilled.

110
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,767
Their wishes have been fulfilled?

111
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:24,667
-You've already got a boyfriend.
-She can't hear a word you're saying.

112
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,500
I will be going now.

113
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,967
Oh, that's right.

114
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,300
The house where the woman
in the legend was born

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,900
is right where this part of the inn is.

116
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,266
Sometimes

117
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,567
she comes here to visit...

118
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,333
or so I've heard.

119
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,667
That scared me!

120
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,300
But it's only a rumor.

121
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
Make yourselves at home. Good bye.

122
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,667
What was that?

123
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,633
That scared you, didn't it?

124
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,433
You were scared, right?

125
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,734
I'll have one too.

126
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,233
That scared you too, right?

127
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,734
Won't any of you admit it?

128
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,233
Come to think of it,

129
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,433
there was something
about close couples visiting the hill

130
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:19,400
and being cursed, or maybe not.

131
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,567
I forget which it was.

132
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:35,900
Come out.

133
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,266
I think it's a great plan
for bringing happiness to

134
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,166
me and Kitaura,

135
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:44,800
Nao and Uehara

136
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,367
and you two as well, of course.

137
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:51,600
I agree that it's the right thing to do.

138
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,734
Now we just have to figure out

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,834
how to get Nao and Uehara to join in.

140
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,266
But what about Issei?

141
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,467
Yeah.

142
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,467
I know. I'll treat him to ramen tomorrow.

143
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,000
-What?
-You forgot about him?

144
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,433
{\an8}Crane Room
Yoshikawa Party

145
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,533
-This is so good!
-This is great!

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,100
-Could I have your scallops?
-My scallops?

147
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,100
-Yeah.
-Then give me your sukiyaki.

148
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,100
Here!

149
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,367
Okay, you two. Draw one out each.

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,300
What is this? Some kind of lottery?

151
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,033
You might win something nice.

152
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,100
Here.

153
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,834
Okay.

154
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,600
This one is for you, Kitaura.

155
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,300
Here, Issei.

156
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,800
What? Don't we even get to choose?

157
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,266
If it's food, I don't want it.

158
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:02,500
It's time for the Tragic Lovers Hill Dare!

159
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,967
-Yeah! A dare!
-Yahoo! What fun!

160
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,266
-This will be great!
-And scary!

161
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:09,967
Count me out.

162
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,467
Uhm...

163
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:17,133
I don't really want to take part
in a dare either.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
{\an8}Huh? "Participation Required"?
Are you crazy?

165
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:25,967
No way.

166
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,734
-A man can't break his promise.
-Your romantic wishes could be fulfilled.

167
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,633
-Are you sure you don't want to, Nao?
-Fine. I'll go. Let me eat.

168
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,700
-But, her ghost might show up.
-Pass me the tuna

169
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,934
-What?
-I'll participate, so give it to me.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,934
Oh, that's too bad.

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,266
It seemed like such a good chance

172
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,667
for you to get that votive plaque
that you wanted so badly.

173
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,967
Votive plaque?

174
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,066
Votive plaque.

175
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,133
Votive plaque!

176
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,400
TRAGIC LOVERS HILL

177
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,233
The rules are simple.

178
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:05,133
You must bring back
my precious votive plaque that is up on...

179
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,533
Tragic Lovers Hill.

180
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,233
-I'll let you have it!
-He'll give it to you!

181
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
-Really?
-You want one, right, Nao?

182
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,066
Yes! I do! I do!

183
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,467
Oh, but do I have to go alone?

184
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,667
Don't you worry!
A dare should always be done in a pair.

185
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:26,200
Now check those tickets you drew earlier.

186
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:31,333
You just might be matched up
with the person of your dreams!

187
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,033
-Oh! It's you, Mitsuishi!
-Cool!

188
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,800
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

189
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:40,967
Huh?

190
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,600
What happened?

191
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:53,233
Sorry! You play the ghost!

192
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
How did that happen?

193
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,133
Oh, dear, Abe.

194
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,700
You're such an idiot.

195
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,367
Okay, I'll be the ghost.

196
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:12,667
Leave some time between each pair.

197
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,433
What a totally useless ghost
he's going to be.

198
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,667
Is this going to be any good?

199
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:21,333
Well, to be honest,
I'm more afraid of the real ghost

200
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
than I am of Abe.

201
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,200
Are you seriously that scared?

202
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,100
-After hearing that story, yes!
-There's no ghost.

203
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,133
If that ghost really does show up,

204
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,500
I'll just run away.

205
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,133
-Don't run away!
-Why not?

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,266
-Uehara.
-What?

207
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,166
-Don't run away!
-You're looking pretty unhappy.

208
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,800
-Good thing it's dark, huh?
-You can't.

209
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,600
-Come on, let's get this over with.
-Please don't!

210
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,867
Boo!

211
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,734
Thanks for setting this up.

212
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,800
Why does this always happen to me?

213
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,834
TRAGIC LOVERS HILL

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,734
Okay, shall we go?

215
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,433
I'll get that votive plaque
and fulfill my romantic wishes!

216
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:29,734
Let's do it!

217
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,133
-Eek!
-What's wrong?

218
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,767
-I'm afraid!
-You're scared already?

219
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,033
-I can't do this!
-Let's go!

220
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,967
No! Wait!

221
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,467
You want that dumb votive plaque, right?

222
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,500
I'm scared! I'm scared!

223
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,100
{\an8}SUCCESSFUL ROMANCE

224
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:47,467
{\an8}Aren't you going to pray so that
your romantic wishes will come true?

225
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,467
I don't believe in that kind of thing.

226
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,934
Same here.

227
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,300
You decide your own fate by yourself.

228
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,533
Yep, that's right.

229
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,200
I don't like the type

230
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,467
that expects other people
to do things for them.

231
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,100
It just shows how dedicated she is to you.

232
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:10,600
She's a really cute girl.
Hold on tight to her.

233
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,567
Her type is actually pretty popular.

234
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:17,633
I never asked for your advice.

235
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,500
You sure get upset when I touch
your sensitive spot.

236
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,233
Would you just shut up?

237
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,667
Oh! Hey, you guys.

238
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,600
You guys sure are fast.
Did you get it already?

239
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,433
Yeah.

240
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,533
That guy is so curt.

241
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,066
You know they really do make a good pair.

242
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Oh, Nao.

243
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,734
Just kidding.

244
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,533
Sorry.

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,500
I didn't mean to complain to you.

246
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:09,934
Okay, it's not far to the top
of Tragic Lovers Hill.

247
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,100
Let's go, Issei.

248
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:28,734
Okay.

249
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,867
After praying this hard,
it should work out.

250
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,834
Don't you agree, Issei?

251
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,934
That'll be enough for sure!

252
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,967
-Issei! Hurry! Let's go!
-Okay.

253
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,834
What's that?

254
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,066
-Huh?
-What?

255
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,166
What happened? Oh, no!

256
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,100
Let's get out of here, Issei!

257
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,667
It's all right. Just calm down.

258
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,767
Oh, no! What's that?

259
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,133
It's taking those two awfully long.

260
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,667
What are they doing?

261
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,266
Do you think they got lost?

262
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,200
How? There's only one trail.

263
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:36,800
Yeah, you're right.

264
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,467
Finally, they're coming back.

265
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,066
What took you so long, Nao?

266
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,300
Huh? Abe?

267
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,133
What are you doing here?

268
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,500
How come you came down first?

269
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,033
You mean Nao and Issei are still up there?

270
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,300
It was getting late,
so I totally thought they'd come down.

271
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
I wonder if something happened to them.

272
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,600
I'm so sorry about this.

273
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,600
How could you faint
at the sight of a raccoon dog?

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,800
It jumped out so suddenly,
it frightened me.

275
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,066
Dang, you're heavy!

276
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,633
Really? You're kidding! I'm sorry.

277
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,033
-I'm sorry, Issei.
-Just kidding.

278
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,033
Your boyfriend sure must have it rough.

279
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,533
-Ugh!
-Yeah, maybe so.

280
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:36,367
I fainted with Uehara once too.

281
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,233
<i>You're so damn heavy,</i>

282
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,734
and such a pain in the ass.

283
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
<i>He carried me on his back then too.</i>

284
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
He complained a whole lot.

285
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,333
When I really think about it,

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,233
I guess I do cause him a lot of trouble.

287
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,600
It won't take long for him
to run out of patience for me.

288
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,700
I've got to get my act together.

289
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:10,900
I need to think more clearly
and be more careful.

290
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,400
And study harder too.

291
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,867
How come you're the only one
who has to change?

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,834
Huh?

293
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,433
Shouldn't a real couple

294
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,300
be equal?

295
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,000
Shouldn't you have an effect on each other

296
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,133
and turn into something great together?

297
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,300
Yeah, there's a lot of things
you need to change.

298
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,533
But, there are a ton of things about him

299
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,233
that I think he really needs to change
as well.

300
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, Issei.

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,767
So, you see

302
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,633
I think it's wrong

303
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,734
for you to change everything
about yourself.

304
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,967
So a true couple should be equal, huh?

305
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,266
Is that the kind of romance you want?

306
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,400
What does that matter?
This isn't about me, anyway!

307
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:13,967
They sure are taking long.

308
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:20,700
Are you going to find them?

309
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,333
This won't end

310
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,333
until those two come back down.

311
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,433
You're just worried about Nao, aren't you?

312
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,567
-Oh, shut up!
-Uehara!

313
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:38,967
Did something happen to you?

314
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,834
Nao fainted.

315
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,066
Sorry for taking so long.

316
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,600
It was probably just a raccoon dog,
or something dumb like that.

317
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,266
How did you know?

318
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,967
I don't even know why you care so much
about that stupid plaque anyway.

319
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,300
She's doing it because she wants
you two to become closer!

320
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,367
I'm leaving.

321
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,333
-What?
-Hey!

322
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,033
Wait up, Uehara! Wait for me!

323
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,066
Hey, Uehara! Hold up!

324
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,133
Listen to what Nao has to say!

325
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,667
Dammit, Uehara! Get down.

326
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:12,100
-Huh?
-Are you okay?

327
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,633
Hey, Uehara! God damn, you!

328
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,834
I challenge you to a duel!

329
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,834
Winner gets Nao!

330
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,333
-What?
-What?

331
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,233
-What are you talking about, Issei?
-Issei?

332
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,567
How can you fight for her?
She and Uehara are dating.

333
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,100
This is so stupid.

334
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,333
Oh, I get it.

335
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,000
You're running away
because you're afraid you might lose.

336
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,633
I didn't think you were such a loser.

337
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,633
I'm not doing it
because it's stupid to fight over Nao.

338
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,100
But if you want to fight me,
go right ahead.

339
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,333
Then that settles it.

340
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,367
What?

341
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,533
Oh! Wait! Wait! Hold on a second here!

342
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,867
-What?
-Get over here!

343
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:58,333
What are you doing?
We're not finished yet!

344
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,367
To be honest, I really don't think Nao
has eyes for anyone else besides Uehara.

345
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,600
-So, please--
-Yeah, I know.

346
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,600
Don't worry about it. I'll lose.

347
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,934
-Huh?
-Huh?

348
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,934
I can't stand that Uehara isn't honest
about his feelings for Nao.

349
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,367
So I was thinking

350
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:18,100
this is a good way for Nao to see
how he really feels about her.

351
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
Oh, I see. That's why.

352
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:21,500
-I'm totally for that!
-Good idea, huh?

353
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,333
-Yeah!
-However...

354
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,166
what should I duel him in?

355
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,967
Oh, you haven't figured that out yet?

356
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:34,333
Since we're at a hot spring,
there's always the usual way.

357
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,767
-What's that?
-Yeah. What?

358
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,567
It's time now to start

359
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:45,533
the First Hot Springs
Ping Pong Competition for Yoshikawa Nao!

360
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,066
-Yeah!
-All right! Ping pong!

361
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,700
Ping pong?

362
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,100
Sounds like fun.

363
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,200
What? You're interested too, Kitaura?

364
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,600
The winner will be determined
after one set.

365
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,200
The uniforms will be <i>yukata</i>!

366
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,500
<i>Yukata</i>!

367
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,967
-Why <i>yukata</i>?
-It's a secret!

368
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:05,934
The winner of the competition

369
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,967
can do whatever they want
with Yoshikawa Nao!

370
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,433
What?
Who gave you the right to decide that?

371
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,266
Don't worry. Just watch, okay?

372
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:20,533
The heroine should simply watch
as her prince battles it out for her.

373
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,667
-That's not right.
-Huh?

374
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,433
-A real couple isn't like that!
-What?

375
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,467
All right, everyone, line up!

376
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,667
If you think you can win, step forward.

377
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,233
Why are you joining, Kitaura?

378
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:55,266
Because it's a perfect chance
to crush you.

379
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,166
What a pain this is.

380
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,233
-Huh?
-Huh?

381
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,767
What are you doing?
Why are you joining in?

382
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,600
Because I want to be equal with you,
Uehara.

383
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,700
I want us to be an authentic
and true couple!

384
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,100
Isn't that right, Issei?

385
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,800
Huh?

386
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,233
Uh... yeah.

387
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,100
Huh?

388
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,033
{\an8}Match one!

389
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,934
{\an8}Yoshikawa Nao versus Uehara Hisashi!

390
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:39,333
Our bright future together
hinges upon my victory here!

391
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,100
{\an8}I'm ready for you!

392
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,266
{\an8}Bring it on.

393
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,800
One point.

394
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,333
I guess our future together
doesn't look good.

395
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,800
Match two!

396
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:27,500
Abe versus Issei!

397
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:32,700
I'm totally serious about this!
You're going down!

398
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,867
I thought you'd given up on Nao.

399
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,333
Didn't you know?

400
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,834
Nao and I get along really well together.

401
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,266
We do?

402
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,400
Really?

403
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,834
You'll never see my serve coming.

404
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,700
{\an8}This is going to be fun.

405
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:53,133
I couldn't see it.

406
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,133
11 points.

407
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,567
-Didn't we just see the same thing?
-Yep.

408
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,300
{\an8}Tournament Line Up

409
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,133
Match three.

410
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,000
-Kitaura Nozomi versus...
-Uehara Hisashi!

411
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:23,967
Why the heck are you taking part?

412
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,767
I just told you.

413
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,233
-This is the perfect chance.
-For what?

414
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,767
To crush you!

415
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:33,600
Oh, come to think of it...

416
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,700
Oh, yeah.
You've got some kind of grudge against me?

417
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,700
You snatched away the one person
who was precious to me.

418
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:46,333
Momoyama Mami.
You remember her, right?

419
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,567
{\an8}It was when I was in elementary school.

420
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,333
<i>I was really popular with the girls.</i>

421
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,266
EIGHT YEARS EARLIER

422
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,033
<i>Compared to those crude and vulgar boys,</i>

423
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
<i>I was way smarter</i>

424
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,000
<i>and way more masculine.</i>

425
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,967
<i>Mami was the one I liked the most
out of all of them.</i>

426
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:05,867
<i>She was as cute as a button
and would always be by my side.</i>

427
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,834
-Uhm...
-Yes?

428
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,000
I've found a guy that I like.

429
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,033
What?

430
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,367
Uehara Hisashi.

431
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,333
<i>Uehara Hisashi.</i>

432
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,467
<i>After that,</i>

433
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,834
<i>Mami was with you all the time.</i>

434
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,200
On Christmas and Valentine's Day!

435
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,300
"Uehara! Uehara!"

436
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,233
You swiped Mami's pure
and innocent heart from me!

437
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,367
I'll say it again.
I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,700
He might just be aggravating her more.

439
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,633
Yeah.

440
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,667
Kitaura's actually has
a very interesting personality.

441
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:45,567
Uh-huh.

442
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:49,867
Today, I'm going to put an end
to this long dispute between us!

443
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,834
Yeah, whatever. Anyway, bring it on.

444
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,200
{\an8}Here goes!

445
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,734
I did my best for you, Mami.

446
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:09,200
You're pretty awful at ping pong, Kitaura.

447
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,767
The time has finally come...

448
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,834
for the final match!

449
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,800
Uehara Hisashi

450
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,667
versus Sata Issei!

451
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,800
This is it, Nao!

452
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:28,500
The final match
we've all been waiting for!

453
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,900
Why are you getting your phone out?

454
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,900
If I win, I'll take Nao for mine.

455
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,433
Say what you like.

456
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,133
Here goes.

457
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:48,100
Like my snap serve?
I got good at that from making ramen!

458
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,667
Yes! Handsome guys dressed
in <i>yukata</i> are so nice!

459
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,133
Their exposed chests
and their flying sweat!

460
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,533
<i>Yukata</i> are so awesome!

461
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,433
That's why we're wearing <i>yukata</i>?

462
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,400
Keep it up, you two!

463
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,834
And loosen up those <i>yukata</i> a little too.

464
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,166
Oh, darn you, Uehara! What are you doing?

465
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:27,333
You could have gotten that
with your right!

466
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,600
Shut up and just watch.

467
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,734
You've got to make better use
of your footwork!

468
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,467
Who made you my coach?

469
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,467
And you've got a lot of wasted movements.

470
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,900
What?

471
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:38,900
Hey!

472
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,367
Your fault for not focusing.

473
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:41,834
That was your fault, Nao!

474
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,700
You pay attention, Uehara.
You'd better win.

475
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,633
You don't have to tell me that. I will!

476
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,967
-Use your right next time.
-Nah, left.

477
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:49,967
What? No, your right.

478
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,567
-Shut up and butt out.
-Your right!

479
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,500
-Don't touch me! Go away!
-Use your right.

480
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,834
Let's do this, Uehara.

481
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,233
Yes!

482
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
Yes!

483
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,734
-Hey, Uehara.
-Yeah?

484
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,900
Even if you lose,
don't break your promise.

485
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,333
You don't have to worry about that

486
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
because I'm not going to lose.

487
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,266
Uehara.

488
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,467
Here goes.

489
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,633
Ow! That hurt!

490
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,233
-Yes!
-Huh?

491
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,667
What? You won?

492
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,367
You mean you didn't see that?

493
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:16,300
Really? You won? For real?

494
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,467
Yeah.

495
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,867
Yes! Yes, Uehara! Yay!

496
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:22,967
Of course I won.

497
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:25,800
-The winner is Uehara!
-Yay!

498
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,367
I'm super thirsty. Let's go.

499
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,734
-Huh?
-Let's get something to drink.

500
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,133
But why me too?

501
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,100
I won, right?
Being able to do whatever I want with you,

502
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,633
means you do what I tell you.

503
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:42,400
But you said it was stupid
to fight over me.

504
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:43,700
Let's go!

505
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,166
I thought this was supposed to make Uehara

506
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,500
show how serious he is about her,
so they'd become closer.

507
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,834
-Looks like it didn't work.
-Yeah.

508
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,500
I don't know about that.
I think Uehara has changed a little.

509
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,667
Really?

510
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:06,333
He's always been so unsociable.
You could never know what he was thinking.

511
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,600
But since he's been with Nao,

512
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,000
he sometimes lets his feelings show to us.

513
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,300
You mean he's become more open?

514
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:16,266
I'm not sure if he's more open
to you, Abe.

515
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,700
-What?
-Huh?

516
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:22,100
I think Uehara <i>has</i> changed.

517
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,333
You know, you're a really good actor,
Issei!

518
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,433
Yeah, you are!
At the end there,

519
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,300
I totally thought you were going to win.

520
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,533
I was very nervous.

521
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Oh, really? You think so?

522
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,734
Well, yeah. You know,

523
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,767
it just comes with experience. Experience.

524
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Here you go.

525
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,400
What is it?

526
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,967
What's gotten into--

527
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:59,066
You're supposed to do as I say, right?
Then hold still.

528
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:07,467
You know, he really does...

529
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:11,834
Huh?

530
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,500
No. It's nothing.

531
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,934
What's with you? Be more careful
who you're around when you faint.

532
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,467
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,633
Silly girl.

534
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:48,900
I sweated a lot. I'm going to take a bath.

535
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,500
Wait. Do I smell sweaty?

536
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,133
I can't let things go
any farther than this.

537
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,767
I've got to be careful.

538
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:14,667
{\an8}<i>Don't you think that's a great idea?</i>

539
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,667
Sounds good to me.
I'll call them right now.

540
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:17,567
Okay!

541
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,800
Girls are way bolder
about this kind of stuff.

542
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,867
Oh! Are you okay with this too, Issei?

543
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:27,166
Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.

544
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,767
-Okay!
-Yeah.

545
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,233
I wonder what I should tell her.

546
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:36,266
That was a really nice bath.

547
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,467
Oh, I probably took too long.

548
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:45,734
Huh?

549
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,233
What?

550
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:53,266
Hey! Those guys' bags are gone...

551
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,967
The girls are gone too?

552
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,166
Huh?

553
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,400
That means...

554
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:06,834
it's just us two alone?

555
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,033
YUSANNOSATO TODOROKI MOTEL

556
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,734
This place was really close.

557
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,467
We got here in no time.

558
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,600
-And it smells nice too.
-It's like a laundromat.

559
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,233
I got another room.

560
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,533
-Thank you, Kitaura.
-Thanks.

561
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:34,767
It's Nao. That was fast.

562
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:37,600
Hello?

563
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,633
Where are you, Marina?

564
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,300
<i>It's a secret.</i>

565
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,000
What?

566
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,233
Why did you disappear all of a sudden?

567
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,433
This was supposed to be a trip
for just you two, right?

568
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:54,800
Yeah, but...

569
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,734
Besides, you've still got two rooms.

570
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,100
It's the same as your place.

571
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,900
Yeah, I guess so.

572
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,066
But still--

573
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:04,967
Anyway, see you later.

574
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:05,967
-What?
-Bye!

575
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,133
Hey! Wait a minute, Marina!

576
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,767
-That's so mean!
-I hung up as fast as I could.

577
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,934
So, where are they?

578
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,333
Uh...

579
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,300
I think they went home.

580
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:28,233
What?

581
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:51,000
Then... let's go to bed.

582
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,533
What?

583
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,700
Don't be stupid! I'll go downstairs.

584
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:01,200
Oh. Yeah. I get it.

585
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,166
You're right.

586
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:11,834
TSUGUMI ROOM
Yoshikawa Party

587
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,367
What was that?

588
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,033
Sometimes

589
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,767
she comes here to visit...

590
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,100
<i>or so I've heard.</i>

591
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:55,133
Uhm... I, uh...

592
00:36:55,834 --> 00:37:00,100
I was kind of hoping
I could sleep here too.

593
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,767
In my room,

594
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:10,967
it feels like there might be... a ghost...

595
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,967
Excuse me! Excuse me! Terribly sorry!

596
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:20,066
Sorry it took me so long.

597
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,967
I thought that all of you
had gone back home.

598
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,967
But you two will be staying, right?

599
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:28,300
-Oh, yes.
-Yes.

600
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,834
You must be a happy man,
with such a pretty wife.

601
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,600
Oh! Should I put out just one futon?

602
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,367
-No! Two!
-No! Two!

603
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,233
Good night. Enjoy yourselves.

604
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,166
Uhm...

605
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,300
Yes?

606
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,100
You know...

607
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,667
I'm going to sleep upstairs.

608
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,233
What?

609
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,300
Wait, Uehara!

610
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,700
Good night.

611
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,233
Don't you...

612
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,033
Don't you think...

613
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,633
I'm attractive?

614
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,934
What?

615
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:05,967
It just seemed like
you rejected me just now.

616
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:08,667
So I...

617
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:12,600
Being with you can be really exhausting.

618
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:19,233
I don't trust myself.

619
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,100
Huh?

620
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:24,834
Don't you see?

621
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:28,233
I don't trust myself. I don't know if I'll
behave if we sleep in the same room.

622
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,367
Do you see? Now, let go of me.

623
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,033
Don't you worry.

624
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,433
I'm not interested in anyone
but you right now.

625
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:57,800
Me either.

626
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,166
I'm not interested in anyone besides you,
Uehara.

627
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,400
You're the most important person to me.

628
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:17,133
So...

629
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:23,033
So, this kind of thing...

630
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,700
I wouldn't mind... if we did it.

631
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:52,900
Nao.

632
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,667
You're really hot right now.

633
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,133
Yeah, I feel really warm.

634
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,467
I'm kind of dizzy

635
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:15,533
and feel faint.

636
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,734
CHIGIRA INN

637
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:21,834
I'm sorry.

638
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,133
I wonder why I got a fever.

639
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:28,800
Maybe I was in the bath too long.

640
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:32,000
Forget about it. Just sleep.

641
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,667
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,767
Yeah, whatever.

643
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,400
You're a handful.

644
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:54,467
I can't believe you actually fell asleep.

645
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:30,200
Dang, now I'm wide awake.

646
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:39,266
Hi.

647
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:42,100
Hey, don't go.

648
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,266
What happened with Nao?

649
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:48,834
She's asleep.

650
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,600
Asleep? You've got to be kidding!

651
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,967
What the heck are you doing
out here, anyway?

652
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,266
-Taking a walk.
-This late at night?

653
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,533
I've got a lot on my mind.

654
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,333
Who cares about me, anyway?

655
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,500
You just do whatever you want
and leave Nao behind?

656
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:18,834
Oh, now I see.

657
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:20,567
What are you so happy about?

658
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,166
I'm not happy.

659
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,400
I'm going back.

660
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,633
Hold on a second!

661
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,433
-What?
-Come on! Just come with me!

662
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,567
But why?

663
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,100
YUSANNOSATO TODOROKI MOTEL

664
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,867
-Got a pair!
-Really?

665
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,834
My natural ability
at cards is shining through!

666
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:42,700
Yes!

667
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,700
Come on! Give it to me! Give it to me!

668
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,100
-Why that one?
-Come on! Let me have that one!

669
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,533
What a pain you are!

670
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,133
You're a pain too. You're both the same.

671
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Quit fooling around.

672
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,533
Hurry up! Hurry up!

673
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,233
Okay, got one!

674
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:09,100
Cut that out!

675
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,333
-Yes!
-You peeked!

676
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,300
I did not!

677
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:28,500
Why isn't Uehara here
when I really need him?

678
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,367
<i>Darn you, Uehara!</i>

679
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,967
{\an8}A FEW DAYS LATER

680
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:42,100
Nao.

681
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,567
You're creeping me out.

682
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:08,734
Hey! Wait! Wait for me!

683
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:11,066
-Where do you want to go next time?
-Huh?

684
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:13,166
You want to go abroad?

685
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,867
We could get a private beach
over the summer!

686
00:45:15,934 --> 00:45:17,900
We don't have that kind of money.

687
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:20,633
What's wrong with having high hopes?

688
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,600
Oh, yeah. I had a crazy dream last night.

689
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,633
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
