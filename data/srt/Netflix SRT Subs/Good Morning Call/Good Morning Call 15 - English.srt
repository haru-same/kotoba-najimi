1
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:15,533
{\an8}<i>Uehara, I hope you're doing well.</i>

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>It's already been two weeks
since we took that wonderful trip.</i>

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,934
<i>I'll be 18 years old soon.</i>

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,066
<i>But, I hate to say it,</i>

5
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:32,066
<i>I'm not sure if I'm prepared
to celebrate my birthday with you.</i>

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,333
<i>My good health was always
the one thing I've had going for me.</i>

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,867
<i>So, until yesterday,</i>

8
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:42,433
<i>I never thought I'd end up like this.</i>

9
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,300
{\an8}Why didn't you answer?

10
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,266
{\an8}ONE DAY EARLIER

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,467
{\an8}-Answer what?
-My texts!

12
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,266
{\an8}Yesterday and today,
you didn't answer any of them.

13
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,834
{\an8}But we see each other every day anyway.

14
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,867
{\an8}That's not the issue here!

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
"Look, Uehara!

16
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,467
Check out these flowers
I saw near my work!"

17
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,233
Yeah, they're so pretty, aren't they?

18
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,400
"Uehara!

19
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,300
I'm at a cafe with Marina right now!

20
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,533
Yum! I'm having
a limited edition special cake!"

21
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,266
That was totally delicious!

22
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,333
It was so sweet! And really cute too!

23
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:25,533
Those kinds of texts don't need an answer.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Yes, they do!

25
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:34,400
You're the first person I wanted
to share my feelings with, that's all.

26
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,500
OK, I understand. Is that all you wanted?

27
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,600
You've got the whole day off
from work today, right?

28
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:43,800
Yeah.

29
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:47,867
Don't you think you've been at home
too much since you got this computer?

30
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:51,166
It's a holiday today,
so why don't we go out somewhere?

31
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:54,066
Sorry, but could you leave me alone?
You're distracting me.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,700
I've been replaced.

33
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:05,734
That computer means more to him than me.

34
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,100
Oh, but maybe

35
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,633
I was being too pushy.

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,033
But that means
I'm a failure as a girlfriend!

37
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,633
Oh, dear!

38
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,633
These must be the DVDs Uehara rented.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,066
I've never heard of any of these.

40
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:55,967
Are you going to watch all those movies?

41
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,667
Uh, yeah.

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,333
I think I'd like to watch them with you.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,834
Don't force yourself.

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,400
You only watch romances
and cartoons, right?

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,133
I'm not forcing myself.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,867
I was just thinking I'd like to watch
your kind of movies.

47
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,734
OK, sure, if you want.

48
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,033
You want one?

49
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,100
Huh? It's not over yet.

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,033
Sorry, but I'm going to watch it
in my room on my computer.

51
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,266
Huh? Wait! Wait a second!

52
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,700
Leave me alone for a while.

53
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,734
What?

54
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,600
I won't be outdone!

55
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,333
My greatest weapon is my cooking!

56
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,734
There we go.

57
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:42,867
It's all ready.

58
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,734
Uehara.

59
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:52,600
I'm going to be demure about this.

60
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,100
I know this is your day off
and I'm sorry to bother you,

61
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,433
but dinner is ready!

62
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:06,500
Send!

63
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:22,100
{\an8}I guess you're not answering
because you're angry?

64
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,633
{\an8}Oh, that's right!
You're still watching that movie.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,600
{\an8}Sorry for bothering you.

66
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,867
<i>Buzz off! Leave me alone, would you?</i>

67
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,433
Now I'm really pissed off!

68
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm not letting you have a bite of this!

69
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll eat it all!

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,633
Go ahead and play with your computer.

71
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,233
Yum! This is good! Really good!

72
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,934
And it made you sick.

73
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,433
Now you're hospitalized for three days.

74
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,100
They think it was the oysters
in my seafood soup.

75
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,967
Getting food poisoning from your own food.
That's so like you, Nao!

76
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,400
Oh, dear!

77
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:35,633
And you two seemed
so lovey-dovey on that trip.

78
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,400
That night nothing happened
because you got a fever, right?

79
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:44,200
Yeah, but the bonds between us
became stronger.

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,367
But I just can't get his attention
away from that computer.

81
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:51,367
Romance is probably pretty low
on his list of priorities.

82
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,133
But don't you think
saying "buzz off" is going too far?

83
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,233
-Is that what you say to your girlfriend?
-No, it's not.

84
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Not only won't he come for a visit,
he doesn't even answer my texts!

85
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,834
He's probably living it up
all by himself now--

86
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,834
This could be a good thing!

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,567
-A good thing?
-Yeah!

88
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:11,100
It'll be good for him to realize
how important you are to him.

89
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:15,200
They say,
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

90
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,500
You get out the day after tomorrow,
and that's your birthday, right?

91
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,700
You two will be totally lovey-dovey
when you get home.

92
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,934
I'm sure he's forgotten.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,533
No. I bet right now he's wondering
what kind of present he should get you.

94
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,200
Saturday is his day off, so he might even
set up a surprise for you!

95
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,467
Oh, my god!

96
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,600
A present from Uehara?

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,967
Happy birthday, Nao.

98
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:57,934
Thank you, Uehara.

99
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,900
Next year, and the next,
and all the years after that,

100
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,567
let's always be together.

101
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,567
Uehara.

102
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,467
Forever, Nao.

103
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,967
You just have to be patient
until the day after tomorrow.

104
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,800
Of course.

105
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,033
-What's that?
-Huh?

106
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,967
-Let me see!
-Cut it out.

107
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,767
{\an8}Out of hospital

108
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,266
Welcome! Water, Nao!

109
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,834
Oh, yeah. She's not here.

110
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,834
Huh? Nao's not here today?

111
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,867
No. Sorry.

112
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:19,433
What the... I came here
because I wanted to see her pretty face.

113
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,867
Don't act like that.
I'll give you free roast pork slices.

114
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,800
You're so generous, Issei!

115
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,066
Nao has become the face of our shop.

116
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,467
No, she hasn't!

117
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,500
Without her around,

118
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,700
there's a lot less trouble
with broken bowls.

119
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,633
-I'm done.
-Get the register, Nao.

120
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,433
Oh, yeah. She's not here.

121
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,567
{\an8}MEGUROGAOKA SAKURA HOSPITAL

122
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,700
I can't take it.

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,767
I can't take this anymore.

124
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,033
Uehara.

125
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,533
Uehara.

126
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,300
Uehara.

127
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
Uehara.

128
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,767
OK, Uehara!

129
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,900
-Oh! Hello--
-<i>This is an answering service.</i>

130
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,100
Uehara. This is Nao.

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,166
You must be busy with work.

132
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,834
I'm doing fine! Just fine!

133
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,100
I'll be home the day after tomorrow,
no problem. Don't worry about me.

134
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,433
You don't need to worry about me at all.
Really!

135
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,667
You don't have to visit either--

136
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,567
Such a cruel boyfriend.

137
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,533
His own girlfriend is sick.
How dare he not contact you?

138
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,367
This is none of your business!

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,033
He's... busy with his work.

140
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Are you sure he's working?

141
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,133
Yes, of course I am!

142
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,967
Unlike me,
even though he's a high school student,

143
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:06,500
he's independent, gets great grades
and is good at sports.

144
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,800
All that's pointless
if he doesn't treat his girlfriend right.

145
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,700
-But I'm the perfect boyfriend!
-Huh?

146
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm devoted and kind.
And mentally, I'm an adult.

147
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,233
Plus, since I'm a university student,
I've got free time.

148
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,533
I never asked.

149
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm Senzaki Yu. Nice to meet you, Nao.

150
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,500
Leave me alone!

151
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,033
I thought I was unlucky
to get acute gastritis,

152
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,934
but it was actually good luck.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,400
I was able to meet
this pretty little lady.

154
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,967
Get your hands off of me!

155
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,967
What's wrong with you?

156
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,100
That hurt!

157
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,600
What's with that weirdo?

158
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:46,734
I wish I was with Uehara right now!

159
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,433
<i>You don't need to worry about me at all.
Really!</i>

160
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,300
<i>You don't have to visit either--</i>

161
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,433
This is braised beef with potatoes.

162
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,867
I made more than we need,
so I wanted to share it.

163
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,266
Oh, thank you.

164
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,600
By the way, Uehara--

165
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,533
Uehara! You...

166
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:33,867
Not you again.

167
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,900
Is that any way to talk
to your best friend?

168
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,567
We're not best friends.

169
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,834
And...

170
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,900
you've got Nao, so why...

171
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
What are you talking about?

172
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,300
I'm Momoyama Mami.

173
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,934
We used to be classmates.

174
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,300
I'm Abe Jun. I'm Uehara's best friend.

175
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,600
If you knew a girl this pretty,
how come you never introduced me?

176
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,767
I didn't know her.
We only met again recently.

177
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,066
-Recently? When?
-I don't remember.

178
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,867
About two weeks ago.

179
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,233
I was visiting someone who lives here,

180
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,233
<i>and just happened to see him.</i>

181
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,400
Is that Uehara?

182
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,300
He was with his girlfriend,
so I didn't say anything

183
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,300
because I didn't want to disturb them.

184
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,233
The next day we ran into each other
on the elevator.

185
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,200
Perfect!

186
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,934
OK, I'll be going now.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,734
OK. Thanks for the food.

188
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,233
Hold on! Hold on!

189
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,600
-Come inside.
-Huh?

190
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,934
For some tea.

191
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,834
What do you think you're doing?

192
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,367
She'll find out we live together.

193
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,533
It'll be fine. Leave this to me.

194
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
-Uhm...
-Oh, sorry.

195
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,400
Actually,
Uehara lives with his older sister.

196
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,767
She's out today, so feel free to come in.

197
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,633
Come, come.

198
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:51,967
His former classmate is totally cute!

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,433
She goes to one of those all-girl schools
for rich princesses.

200
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,667
She's a perfect young lady.

201
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,934
The queen of young ladies.

202
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,233
At any rate,

203
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,734
she's as pretty as a picture.

204
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,600
Letting strangers in is against the rules.

205
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:14,000
Besides, if he's got time for that,
then why isn't he visiting me?

206
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,633
-You don't misunderstand, Nao?
-Huh?

207
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,033
She has a boyfriend.

208
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,467
He's older and lives in the building.

209
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:26,533
So it's more like
just a neighborly friendship.

210
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,333
Oh, but I'm not worried at all.

211
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,467
Really?

212
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:35,166
Things like being cute or sexy

213
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,333
don't mean anything to Uehara.

214
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,800
I guess you're right.
He <i>did</i> choose you, after all.

215
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,200
All he was really interested in
was her cooking.

216
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,367
-What?
-What?

217
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:52,967
She... cooked something for him?

218
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,967
Yeah. But it was more like,

219
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,400
"I made too much for my boyfriend,
so I'm sharing it."

220
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,700
-And he took it?
-Yep.

221
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,200
Why?

222
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,033
-Why?
-Don't take it that way!

223
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,133
The first time, he was totally starving,

224
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,867
so he couldn't stop himself.

225
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,934
Couldn't stop himself?

226
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,600
Then she kept on bringing it,
so he'd accept it.

227
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:20,567
Now he can't refuse--

228
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,567
He should refuse!

229
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,533
Don't tell me that!

230
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,767
Darn him!

231
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,467
<i>That spells trouble.</i>

232
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,667
-You think so?
-Yep.

233
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,100
Oh, but you see,

234
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,734
she's got a boyfriend--

235
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,266
-Don't be a fool.
-Huh?

236
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,433
-Nao.
-Yes?

237
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,166
Why do you think I'm so popular
with the girls?

238
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,233
Because you're cooler
and more masculine than most guys.

239
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,800
That's true, but it's not the only reason.

240
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,700
-I will never cheat on them.
-Huh?

241
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,133
All men will cheat on their women!

242
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,667
Whether he's got a girlfriend
or she has a boyfriend doesn't matter.

243
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,834
His instincts will always win!
That's the kind of beast men are.

244
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,433
I see.

245
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,934
So, you've been in a lot of relationships.

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,467
I've never been in one.

247
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,734
What?

248
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,967
But lots of girls
have shared their problems with me,

249
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,533
so I know all about men.

250
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,767
Oh, now I see.

251
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:19,300
You'd better watch out.
She's going to be trouble.

252
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,967
It's obvious she's trying to get at him
through his stomach.

253
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,033
In fact,
she could be lying about

254
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,467
her boyfriend living in that building.

255
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,700
Really?

256
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>Uehara.</i>

257
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,867
We meet again.

258
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,667
-Sorry for making you come with me.
-It's OK.

259
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:59,166
My boyfriend said he was going to be late,

260
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,567
so I didn't know how I was going to
pass the time.

261
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,367
I'll pay, so have as much as you like.

262
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:08,000
No, it's OK.
You gave me food yesterday too.

263
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:16,200
I've got a favor that I want to ask you,
Uehara.

264
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,467
We're going to have
an elementary school reunion.

265
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,033
A reunion?

266
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,567
I'm in charge of organizing the girls.

267
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:29,066
All the other girls are begging me
to get you to come.

268
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,133
Do you think you can come?

269
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,834
Well... I've got work.

270
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,000
Please! Even just for an hour.

271
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:41,900
I guess your girlfriend wouldn't be
too happy about that, would she?

272
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,333
No, it's OK.

273
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,133
Oh, you're still not over
what happened a long time ago?

274
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,367
What happened a long time ago?

275
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:55,700
You know, I liked you the whole time
we were in school.

276
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,166
-Uhm...
-Yes?

277
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,300
What's your name again?

278
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,667
I'm really sorry.

279
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,767
I'm terrible at remembering names.

280
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm Mami. Momoyama Mami.

281
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:21,800
Momoyama... Mami.

282
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,000
You snatched away the one person
who was precious to me.

283
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:27,867
Momoyama Mami.

284
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,133
That's you?

285
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,266
You finally remembered?

286
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:37,734
No. I don't remember
what happened between us.

287
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,133
-You're so mean.
-Oh. I'm sorry.

288
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,900
Seriously. I'm sorry.

289
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,567
I'm just playing with you.
You're too funny, Uehara.

290
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,333
I feel stupid for being worried about it.

291
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,433
You're not angry?

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,166
No.

293
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,567
But you'll come to the reunion,
won't you?

294
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,934
Fine, I will.

295
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,066
Good! Let's exchange numbers!

296
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:20,567
<i>♪ Happy birthday to me ♪</i>

297
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,633
We'll finally see each other again today,
Uehara.

298
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,100
<i>♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>

299
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:35,100

MEGURAGAOKA SAKURA HOSPITAL

301
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,700
{\an8}RECEIVING NEW MESSAGES. PLEASE WAIT.

302
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,834
{\an8}NO NEW MESSAGES.

303
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,700
You must be kidding me.

304
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Come on! Come on!

305
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,066
Come on!

306
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,033
NO NEW MESSAGES

307
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,500
It's my birthday,
and I'm getting out of the hospital.

308
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,667
How come he hasn't contacted me?

309
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,033
You mean, he might not come and get me?

310
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,567
Uehara...

311
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,333
I'm so sad to see you go!

312
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,100
What the heck do you think you're doing?

313
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,033
I was trying to get a good-bye kiss.

314
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,700
This guy's more trouble than Abe.

315
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,767
You sure are rough, Nao.

316
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,600
Maybe that's why he won't contact you.

317
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:54,500
Are you crazy?

318
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,100
I bet your girlfriend won't call you

319
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,433
because you're
always hitting on other girls.

320
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,667
Huh?

321
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,133
You're always here because you're waiting
for her to call, right?

322
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,700
This is the only place in the hospital
we can use our phones.

323
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,066
I don't have a girlfriend.
But there is a girl that I like.

324
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,166
So, it's one-sided love.

325
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:16,600
No. It will become two-way love very soon.

326
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:20,333
So, come on, Nao. Give me a kiss.

327
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,367
You're absolutely disgusting!
Just who do you think you are?

328
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:29,333
See you around.

329
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,100
What's with that weirdo?

330
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,900
Oh, god! I can't take this any longer.

331
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,200
I want to be with Uehara.
He'll make me feel better.

332
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,033
Uehara!

333
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,133
Uehara!

334
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,133
Uehara!

335
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,734
I guess he hasn't come home yet.

336
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,200
Could this be...

337
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:20,500
a love letter from Uehara?

338
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,600
What does it say? What does it say?

339
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,800
"I'll be sleeping over
at my job for a while."

340
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:31,867
{\an8}I'll be sleeping over
at my job for a while. Uehara.

341
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,233
What?

342
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:41,600
What the... But why? Why?

343
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,333
Why? Why? Why?
How can he leave like that?

344
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,567
And why today of all days?

345
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,266
My phone! My phone!

346
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,700
<i>This is an answering service.</i>

347
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:06,834
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

348
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,700
If he's going to do that,
then I'm going to his work!

349
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,767
-Eek!
-Whoa! You scared me!

350
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,400
Nao! Here!

351
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,300
Huh? What's this?

352
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,867
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

353
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:28,934
Happy birthday, Nao. Pretty huge, huh?

354
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:30,600
-Can you guess what it is?
-I don't know.

355
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,433
<i>-♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪
-♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

356
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
-Blow them out!
-Blow them out!

357
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,467
Happy birthday!

358
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,800
Thanks, you guys!

359
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,500
-Are you surprised?
-Yeah, I sure am!

360
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,667
We all decided to give you
a surprise party.

361
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:57,400
Oh, I see. He tricked me.

362
00:23:57,467 --> 00:24:00,367
OK, Nao. Take a look at this.

363
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:04,166
This is what you've been wanting!

364
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,433
-Here goes!
-Have at it!

365
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,867
Uehara! Uehara!

366
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,834
Abe...

367
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,200
Hey, Abe! Why are you sleeping?

368
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:26,033
Ah! He's drooled on her present!

369
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,467
Dammit! What's wrong with you?

370
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,266
Here you go, Nao!
Exactly what you've wanted.

371
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,433
A Moussy stole and a Tarepanda pillow.

372
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,667
-Thank you.
-Yeah!

373
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,667
I'm really happy. Thank you, everyone.

374
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:44,300
You're welcome.

375
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,834
-So, where's Uehara?
-Where's Uehara?

376
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:49,834
-Huh?
-Huh?

377
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,700
You mean he still hasn't contacted you?

378
00:24:58,734 --> 00:24:59,867
No.

379
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:01,967
Are you saying

380
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,967
he didn't come to the hospital
or your birthday either?

381
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,633
Where are you going, Marina?

382
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,934
Isn't it obvious? Uehara's work.

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
-I'll drag him back here if I have to.
-Don't be so hasty!

384
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,066
I don't care what his excuse is.
This is awful!

385
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,100
It's her first birthday
since they started dating, and she's sick.

386
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,600
This is totally unacceptable!

387
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,667
Oh! Look! Look!

388
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,800
-I just got a text from him.
-Really?

389
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:31,467
It says, "Sorry,
but I have to stay longer at work."

390
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:33,300
He says we'll celebrate when he gets home.

391
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,834
You sure you're not lying, Nao?

392
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,533
Yeah. I'm totally happy now!

393
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,867
Not just my friends,
but my boyfriend will celebrate with me.

394
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,233
Yeah!

395
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,300
-Let me see the text.
-Don't make her do that.

396
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,867
-I'm not lying.
-I think she is.

397
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:50,166
Happy birthday, Nao!

398
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,433
-You're late, stupid!
-Happy birthday!

399
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,066
This is nothing to celebrate! Damn you!

400
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,133
You drooled on the pillow!

401
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,800
Nao.

402
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,300
Oh, Issei.

403
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,400
I thought you'd already gone home.

404
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,800
I rang the doorbell.

405
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:18,233
Sorry. I didn't hear it at all.

406
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,800
-Did you forget something?
-Yeah.

407
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,633
There's something I forgot to say.

408
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:27,800
Huh?

409
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,533
Are you happy with the way things are?

410
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,633
Don't you think there are other guys
that will treat you better than he does?

411
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,834
-He treats me well.
-He does? But--

412
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,467
Uehara treats me very well.

413
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,867
He really does.

414
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:54,967
It's just that right now
he wants to be alone.

415
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,800
You know how guys are like that sometimes.

416
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,633
You mean he left?

417
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,934
No, it's nothing serious like that.

418
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,433
Nao!

419
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Tell me what's happened.

420
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:26,233
It's all because... I bug him too much.

421
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,567
What's that supposed to mean?

422
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,333
Unlike me, he's very independent.

423
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:39,200
He's the type that likes
to watch movies alone.

424
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,467
With someone like me
around all the time...

425
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:52,700
I'm just... a bother to him.

426
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,667
But, you see...

427
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,066
I just wanted...

428
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,200
to share the same feelings with him.

429
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:25,633
To feel excited... or romantic...

430
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:36,600
and all other kinds of feelings.
I just wanted to experience them together.

431
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,300
I wonder what it's like to share feelings
with the person you love.

432
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:12,066
COFFEE SHOP

433
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:22,867
{\an8}YOSHIKAWA NAO

434
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,500
Abe told me that this is where you work.

435
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,233
What the hell is going on?
Why did you move out like that?

436
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:46,200
-It's none of your business.
-Yes it is.

437
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,400
She's not just an employee.

438
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:52,967
She's the face of our shop now.

439
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,734
She's like part of my family.

440
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,867
I can't help but worry
about her emotional health.

441
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:05,900
Or is there some other reason
why you've left?

442
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,567
No.

443
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,233
Abe told me all about you.

444
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:14,467
You've been pretty popular lately.

445
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,700
What?

446
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,867
There's some girl
bringing you home-cooked meals.

447
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:24,433
If you call that being popular,
then it's nothing new.

448
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,300
How dare you brag like that?

449
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,300
Hey! Chill out, man! Hands off!

450
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,767
-What's that?
-What?

451
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,500
A love letter?

452
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,433
Who said you could look at that?

453
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,266
So...

454
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,066
is this the reason you moved out?

455
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,433
If you ever see Yoshikawa Nao again,
I'll tell your school.

456
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,400
Rice porridge.

457
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,266
MILK PUDDING

458
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,433
Uehara...

459
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:48,266
When did you get this?

460
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,367
The day Nao was hospitalized.

461
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,233
A second one came yesterday.

462
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:57,633
Then how come you haven't told her?

463
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,467
She's ill, so I didn't want to cause her
any extra worry.

464
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:04,333
But that's no reason
to move out all of a sudden.

465
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,767
I don't know who's watching us.

466
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:11,367
They could go nuts
and do something to Nao.

467
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:16,266
I wanted to think about what to do alone.

468
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,200
How come you're like that?

469
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:23,867
What?

470
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,633
Nao wants a relationship
with you that's equal.

471
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,066
She wants to share everything with you,
the happy and sad things. Everything!

472
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:39,967
Don't you think you should be looking out
for her feelings most of all?

473
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,066
-Why do you have to make a big deal?
-What did you say?

474
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,633
Anyway...

475
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,233
I'm only staying away
until this blows over.

476
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,367
Once things cool down,
I'll explain everything to her.

477
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,734
-You jerk!
-I told you--

478
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,467
What's the point unless you see her today?

479
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:01,867
Huh?

480
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,400
EVENING STAR RAMEN

481
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,367
<i>I was wondering,</i>

482
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:08,667
do you think Uehara
doesn't know today is Nao's birthday?

483
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,734
What?

484
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:20,233
No way! I'm sure Nao has told him.

485
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,233
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,734
There's no way he wouldn't know.

487
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,934
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,166
-He might not.
-You're right.

489
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,133
Thanks always. From Nao.

490
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,033
I never knew it's your birthday today!

491
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,567
I'm not interested in anyone besides you,
Uehara.

492
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:55,400
You're the most important person to me.

493
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,467
What kind of present does she want?

494
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,800
What kind of present does any woman want?

495
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:21,133
Welcome.

496
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:23,600
I'm looking for a birthday present.

497
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:26,567
{\an8}This is our most popular item now.

498
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,433
OK.

499
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,934
I never should have bought that computer.

500
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:37,734
Uhm... could you

501
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,900
discount this for me?

502
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:09,500
He's rented some niche movies again.

503
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,967
<i>LATE FALL IN MIRECOURT</i>

504
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,200
<i>MAGRITTE OF THE WIND AND CLOUDS</i>

505
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,467
He rented romances?

506
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,633
Are these for me?

507
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,133
Hello?

508
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,834
Uehara! Where are you now?

509
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,934
I'm right in front of you.

510
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,900
OK. I'll be there in a--

511
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,533
Huh?

512
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:01,600
Hi.

513
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:05,967
Uehara!

514
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,700
What are you running away for?

515
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,300
Sorry.

516
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,967
I've got to tell you something.

517
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,200
{\an8}If you ever see Yoshikawa Nao again,
I'll tell your school.

518
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:20,667
{\an8}What this means
is that someone is watching us.

519
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:25,367
So I thought
I probably should stay in my room.

520
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:30,433
-Why?
-Huh?

521
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,133
Why didn't you tell me?

522
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Because I didn't want to
cause you unnecessary worry.

523
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:36,967
It's not unnecessary!

524
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,767
Thinking about it together <i>is</i> necessary.

525
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,500
Sorry.

526
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,934
This kind of thing
doesn't bother me at all.

527
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,166
I'm used to your fans picking on me
and teasing me.

528
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:06,834
But what if the school finds out?

529
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,567
We'll think of something when it happens.

530
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:14,300
It'll be too late once the trouble starts.

531
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,767
You may be saying that now...

532
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,300
but I know you like it better
when you're alone.

533
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,700
Well...

534
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:39,834
Nao.

535
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:47,300
What's wrong?
Are you sick at your stomach again?

536
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:53,200
-I can't take this.
-Huh?

537
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:56,266
I was so lonely!

538
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:02,467
I was worried the whole time,
and you never texted back to me.

539
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,567
Then when I finally
got out of the hospital,

540
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,967
you had moved out. I don't want that!

541
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,567
Even if you do want me to "buzz off"...

542
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,900
I don't want to leave you.

543
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,867
I'm sorry...

544
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,100
for sending you that text.

545
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:38,734
I didn't think I had put you
under so much pressure, Nao.

546
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,100
But put up with this for now.

547
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,734
There will be real trouble
if the school finds out.

548
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,767
-We'll be apart only a little--
-No!

549
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:55,367
It can't be helped! I miss you too!

550
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,266
Really?

551
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,934
What?

552
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
You really do?

553
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,734
Here.

554
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,533
Uehara.

555
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:40,567
Don't be angry.

556
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:44,467
I didn't have much money,
so this is all I could get.

557
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,633
This is mostly your fault anyway.

558
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,400
Why didn't you tell me
it was your birthday?

559
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,934
Thank you.

560
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,367
I'll treasure it forever.

561
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,367
It's not <i>that</i> special.

562
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:22,700
Nao.

563
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,700
Let's go.

564
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,367
Huh? Where?

565
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:36,300
There's no need to go buy milk pudding
at this time of night.

566
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,066
It's your fault for eating mine.

567
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,033
I thought you'd gotten that for me too.

568
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:47,166
Hey! It's my birthday!
You should treat me nicer today!

569
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,266
Uehara?

570
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,166
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,166
It's your special day, after all.

572
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:03,767
Oh, forget about it.

573
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:06,133
I'm just glad you're back.

574
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,200
How beautiful!

575
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,100
It's a full moon today.

576
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:26,867
Yeah.

577
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:35,467
Like they say,
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

578
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:37,867
Huh?

579
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:42,700
We'll only be apart for a little while.

580
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,800
You mean...

581
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,333
Let's fight this blackmail, Uehara!

582
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,600
You bet.

583
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,266
Oh!

584
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,233
What?

585
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,133
Did you take me out here

586
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,033
so you could show me this?

587
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,734
No!

588
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,533
I'm so happy.

589
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:44,000
Nao, someone might be watching us.

590
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,066
Ah, who cares?

591
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:58,767
Nao.

592
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:01,934
Yes?

593
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,100
Happy birthday.

594
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:10,600
Thank you, Uehara.

595
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,300
<i>Mami!</i>

596
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:21,734
Oh, Yu! You got out of the hospital?

597
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,700
Yeah.

598
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,433
What the heck are you doing out here?

599
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:28,133
I was just passing by.

600
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,967
I'm so sorry for not texting you back.

601
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:31,300
Yeah, whatever. It's OK.

602
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:40,500
Him again?

603
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:48,367
I'm so sleepy.

604
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:52,100
I had never watched movies all night long.

605
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,967
Why did you watch all those DVDs
in one night?

606
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,500
I thought you were going to watch with me.

607
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,834
No way. Romances are so boring.

608
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,500
That still hasn't changed about you.

609
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,233
Nao, this is far enough. Get back inside.

610
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,767
No.

611
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,567
What's with you?

612
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,133
But from now on,
you won't be home when I return.

613
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,900
I want to make the most
of our time together.

614
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,400
-By the way...
-Yes?

615
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:33,300
Why don't you ask Marina to come over
while I'm gone?

616
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:34,200
Why?

617
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, it's dangerous at night.

618
00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:41,266
And there's strange people
like that around.

619
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:46,633
Quit staring, stupid.

620
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,133
Huh?

621
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,734
Hey!

622
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:57,633
Issei? Is that you, Issei?

623
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,133
-Huh?
-What are you doing?

624
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:05,300
What happened to your face?
Are you all right?

625
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:11,400
Your dad found out
about the broken $12,000 bowls?

626
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:14,400
Yeah. The other day, that special customer

627
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,567
placed an order
for the first time in a long time.

628
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,467
You idiot!

629
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:21,934
Don't worry.

630
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:25,333
It was my fault for not telling him.

631
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:27,667
What should we do?

632
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,200
I'll go apologize to your dad.

633
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:31,533
No, don't do that.

634
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,600
I'll tell him everything. You just wait.

635
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,667
But I can't just watch
without doing anything.

636
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:42,767
I don't care what you do.
I've got to get to work.

637
00:45:42,934 --> 00:45:45,300
Cool as ice, just like always.

638
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:51,066
Oh, yeah. Could I stay here tonight?

639
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,000
You're going to be alone from today.
It's perfect timing.

640
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:55,734
Well...

641
00:45:58,367 --> 00:46:00,767
If your boyfriend doesn't like it,
then I understand.

642
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:06,800
OK, you can stay.

643
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,767
-Huh?
-What?

644
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,633
This is really my fault
in the first place.

645
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,667
You can stay here for as long as it takes
for you and your dad work things out.

646
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:18,533
Uh, but,

647
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,500
morally, I don't think that's proper--

648
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:22,066
Don't worry about it.

649
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:24,266
You're like family to me, Issei.

650
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:26,600
It's OK, isn't it, Uehara?

651
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:31,500
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

652
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:39,200
I won't be here starting today.

653
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,533
I know that.

654
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,667
We just promised each other yesterday

655
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:46,500
that we'd do our best
even though we're apart.

656
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,700
-What?
-Don't you see?

657
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:58,033
Since I won't be here...

658
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,867
It'll be just me and you.

659
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,433
Oh! That's right!

660
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,066
That's right! That's no good!

661
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,567
Oh! I have an idea!

662
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:11,233
You stay here too, Uehara.

663
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,433
Huh?

664
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,900
Issei will be here too,
so it'll be like camouflage.

665
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:16,633
Camouflage?

666
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,500
Come on, Uehara? OK?

667
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:26,000
You sleep in the living room.

668
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:31,000
Thank you!

669
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,567
Oh! That's right!

670
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:42,000
That means three of us
will be living together.

671
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:45,800
You sure it's OK?

672
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,133
It can't be helped.

673
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:19,500
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
