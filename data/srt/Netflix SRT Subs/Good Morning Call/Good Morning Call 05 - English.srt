1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,100
I like Uehara.

2
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh!

3
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,367
{\an8}-Uhm...
-How's your fever?

4
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,900
{\an8}-It's OK now.
-Oh, I see.

5
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,867
Did he hear me?

6
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:50,066
Or didn't he?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Which is it?

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,300
-Argh!
-What? Did you say something?

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,800
No... Nothing at all.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,767
He heard.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,667
He didn't hear.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,767
He heard.

13
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,300
He didn't hear.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Yes!

15
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,600
Oh. Yours is in the fridge.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, thank you.

17
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,300
By the way,

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,100
you didn't happen to hear

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,767
what I said in the park just now,
did you?

20
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,000
No.

21
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,500
Thank goodness.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,500
I <i>did</i> hear you say that you liked me,
or something like that.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,367
What?

24
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,600
Oh no!

25
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:53,300
-You're faking it, right?
-Huh?

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,734
Don't worry. I know you're not serious.

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,300
Yeah, that's right.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
He would never give up
unless you said that, right?

29
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,867
Yes, yes. That's right.

30
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:10,100
I heard he's called
the king of the love confession.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,600
He falls in love with anyone
and tells them he loves them.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
-I'm happy for you.
-Huh?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,300
It's nice that there's someone
that thinks you're attractive.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
What?

35
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,834
What're you so angry about?
I was complimenting you.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,967
That's no compliment!

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,900
It's not funny.

38
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,700
Huh? I'm not laughing at you.

39
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:57,200
That Uehara can sure be stupid.

40
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:00,100
Well, I guess I'm glad about it.

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
But it kind of ticks me off
that he doesn't think anything of me.

42
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:09,800
Nao, you actually like Uehara,
don't you?

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,500
I can tell. There's no need to hide it.

44
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm not trying to hide it.

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,667
I realized it myself recently.

46
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,000
Finally, you accepted it.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,100
Like I figured.
I was in love with Uehara too.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
So I know it was hard to tell me.

49
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,300
-Sorry.
-Now, you listen to me.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,800
You're more important to me
than Uehara is.

51
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,367
Keeping it secret
from me really made me sad.

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,200
Oh, Marina.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm so happy that I finally get to talk
about love life with you.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,900
You look happy.

55
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,300
What're you doing for New Year's?

56
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm planning to go to my parent's.
You're going back too, right?

57
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,600
No.

58
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,200
My brother and Yuri are going to be
in Hawaii on New Year's.

59
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,300
-Hawaii?
-They said it's their honeymoon.

60
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,200
I see.

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,100
-Then that means you're...
-Working.

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,967
Hourly wages go up during New Year's.

63
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:16,934
I'll probably get a New Year's bonus too.

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,467
-You're spending New Year's Eve here?
-I'll just come home and go to bed.

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,600
Oh, I see.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Make sure you do your New Year's cleaning
before you go home.

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,400
I will.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,600
It's just so expensive
to travel home during New Year's.

69
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,100
And I used way too much money
to move in here.

70
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:42,734
Plus I've got remedial lessons.

71
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,200
<i>But, at least you can come home
for New Year's Day and after.</i>

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,934
But, you see, they asked me to work then.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,967
And spring vacation isn't that long
after winter vacation.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
<i>I guess so.</i>

75
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,300
<i>Besides, it won't be easy
to get a plane ticket now.</i>

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,367
Plane tickets are really expensive
during New Year's.

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,667
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

78
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>I'll send you some New Year's gift money.</i>

79
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,200
Thank you, Mom. Bye.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,000
This means... New Year's Eve with Uehara.

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,467
Happy New Year.
I wish you all the best this year.

82
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,767
Me too.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
This is going to be so nice.

84
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,567
What? We're closed on New Year's?

85
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,600
On New Year's Eve, most people eat soba.

86
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,900
It's the only time ramen shops
can take a nice break.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Every year we're open till the 30th
and start again on the third.

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,400
-No work, huh?
-You're going home, aren't you?

89
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,066
Huh?

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,700
Oh, yes.

91
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:34,867
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

92
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:36,867
Oh!

93
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,967
-Daichi, what brings you here?
-I'm hungry.

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
Actually, I'm a fan of this ramen now.

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,100
-Thanks for revisiting!
-Thanks for revisiting!

96
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,300
-Here you go.
-Looks great.

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,500
Thanks.

98
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,100
By the way, Nao--

99
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Welcome!

100
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
-Abe.
-What are you doing here, Nao?

101
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,700
Well, I work here.

102
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,000
-Now I see.
-Huh?

103
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,600
I was talking to Mitsuishi.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,600
He said since I was feeling down
about being turned down by you

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,500
that I should come here.
He said I'd get over it for sure.

106
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,200
What was he thinking?

107
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,500
What's so funny?

108
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,734
I think I'm getting over it now.

109
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,600
That's not funny.

110
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,800
He's a friend of yours, Nao?

111
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh! Your boyfriend?

112
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,867
I hope to be. But she's turned me down.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,400
Abe, don't talk about that.

114
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,400
Wow. You're unexpectedly popular.

115
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,400
What do you mean, "unexpectedly"?

116
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,100
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,300
-Nao.
-Yes?

118
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
Before the end of the year,

119
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll get over the girls I've loved
this year.

120
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,300
And I'll start looking for new love
in the new year.

121
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,300
Good.

122
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:02,600
I think you need to be
a little more careful next year.

123
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,000
You know that's why they call you
the king of the love confession.

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
But when I really like someone,

125
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,834
I just don't feel right
if I don't tell them.

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,300
Yeah, that's right. I know how you feel.

127
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Issei, what are you talking about?

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm the type that says what I feel
when I like someone.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Yep.

130
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,000
When you don't do anything,
you regret it way longer

131
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,000
than when you do.

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Can I call you "teacher"?
Ramen, please, teacher!

133
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,834
-One order of ramen.
-Coming right up.

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,900
COFFEE SHOP

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
-You can go when you're done there.
-OK.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,300
-Hi, Uehara.
-Oh, hi.

137
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Hey, Uehara,

138
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:47,500
when are you going to tell me
your new address?

139
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,500
I'll tell you
when you catch up to my age.

140
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,867
That's mean. I'll never catch up.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,834
Nanako. You've got studying to do.

142
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm not studying
until I get Uehara's address.

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,200
-Aw, jeez. Go ahead, you can leave.
-Yes, sir.

144
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,767
-Later.
-Hey, Uehara.

145
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,300
After work on New Year's Eve,

146
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,100
spend the New Year's countdown with us.

147
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
-Good bye.
-Thanks. Bye.

148
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,600
-Dad.
-What is it?

149
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,600
-I know you have it.
-What?

150
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:19,000
Uehara's new address.

151
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,834
That's personal information, you know.

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

153
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm so hungry.

154
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:39,567
Who could that be?

155
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,100
Yes?

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,500
Come on in.

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,767
-Sorry for dropping in like this.
-It's OK.

158
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,066
Where's Uehara?

159
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
-I think he's working at the gas station.
-Excellent.

160
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,767
When he's around,
he always pesters me to leave.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,900
-I bought us some donuts.
-Really? Great!

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,867
Huh? You're still in your uniform?
Isn't it winter vacation now?

163
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,000
School hasn't gone well... So I...

164
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,834
Remedial lessons, huh?

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
I had to take them too.

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,467
-What? You?
-Uh-huh.

167
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,300
Takuya, my husband,

168
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:27,834
he always got good grades,
but mine were horrible.

169
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,000
So his brains are inherited.

170
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:34,400
-Here you go.
-Huh? New Year's gift money?

171
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,734
We'll be traveling, so can you
give it to him on New Year's Day?

172
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:39,800
Sure.

173
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,667
The other day, I visited him at his job,

174
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,200
but he never actually listens.

175
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,500
Oh, one of them is for you.

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,300
What? No, I can't accept--

177
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:53,200
No, no.
This is a token of our appreciation.

178
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,367
Thanks for all you do for Uehara.

179
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,300
No, I don't do anything at all.

180
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,567
And...

181
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:12,000
Ta-da! Kagami mochi.

182
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,567
It's gigantic.

183
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:17,300
What do you think about putting it here?

184
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:21,300
Wow! It's amazing!
I didn't know they sold ones this big.

185
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,300
Cool, huh?

186
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,000
Huh?

187
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,567
<i>Yes?</i>

188
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,700
-Who are you?
-Uh... May I have your name?

189
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,400
-Where's Uehara?
-He's at work now.

190
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,667
-May I please have your name--
-What have you got to do with Uehara?

191
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,667
We live together.

192
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,200
What? Hey, out of my way!

193
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:55,000
Wait a second! Hold it right there!

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,767
-Oh, is that you, Nanako?
-Oh, Yuri.

195
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,667
What? You know each other?

196
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,934
Who the heck are you?

197
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,800
Who am I? I live with Uehara.
My name's Nao Yoshikawa.

198
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,400
You told me that before.

199
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,500
But why are you living together?

200
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,834
Well, it's the result of several things...

201
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,300
Oh, but we're not sleeping together.
We're merely living together.

202
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,567
Damn straight!

203
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,300
There's no way in hell

204
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,100
Uehara would fall for a girl
with such little sex appeal as you.

205
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,934
How do you even know that?

206
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,934
Quit staring at me.

207
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

208
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,800
I can't even tell your front
from your back.

209
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,967
I know Uehara would never try anything
with you.

210
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,500
-Why you--
-Let me ask you this.

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,100
Has he ever tried anything with you
while living together?

212
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,500
He hasn't, has he?

213
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,867
No...

214
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,000
Obviously, he's not attracted to you
at all.

215
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,200
Uehara has already promised

216
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,800
to spend the New Year countdown
with me.

217
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,734
-Really?
-Hey, you.

218
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,967
I thought I'd hear this out,
but you're just making stuff up.

219
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,967
He only treats you nicely
because you're his manager's daughter.

220
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,000
What makes you think you're so sexy?

221
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,834
Well, you see... I'm a C cup.

222
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,934
And you, Yuri,
may look like you've got a nice rack,

223
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,400
but those are pads in your bra!

224
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
What?

225
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,500
Is that true?

226
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,967
To tell you the truth...

227
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,700
How little you know.

228
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,500
Now you listen here. Big boobs...

229
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,100
sag with age.

230
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,100
What...

231
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm still only 15.
I'll work hard to keep them firm!

232
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,100
-Fifteen?
-Fifteen?

233
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
You sure look old!

234
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,667
How rude! I'm just mature-looking.

235
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,800
You're the one who's an old woman.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,367
Hey! I'm still only--

237
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,367
Shut up! What the hell is all this racket?

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,100
You'll disturb the neighbors..

239
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,500
Welcome home.

240
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,800
Hey! Wait! Stop! Don't you dare run away!

241
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
Are you nuts? What're they doing here?

242
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,200
-How should I know?
-I bet you do.

243
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,400
-Why'd you invite her? Who is she?
-I didn't invite her.

244
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Uehara!

245
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:38,100
These two are teasing me.

246
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,400
-What a liar!
-She's a different person.

247
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,000
You shouldn't get involved
with uncivilized people like them.

248
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,700
Dad said the second-floor room
might become vacant next month.

249
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
He'll rent it to you super cheap.

250
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,967
-Huh?
-What?

251
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,600
-You OK?
-Yeah... I'm OK...

252
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:58,400
Uehara, are you going to move again?

253
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,200
She's just making stuff up.

254
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,700
Hey, Nanako. Get home before it gets dark.

255
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,767
OK.

256
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,800
<i>Dad said the second-floor room</i>

257
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,000
<i>might become vacant next month.
He'll rent it to you super cheap.</i>

258
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
-Huh?
-What?

259
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,800
Is he really going to move out?

260
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,567
He must be at work.

261
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,066
Huh? Who could that be?

262
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,300
Yes?

263
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Oh, Daichi. What's up?

264
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Remedial classes end today, right?

265
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,467
I've got practice too,
so I thought we could go together.

266
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,567
-OK.
-I've got something to tell you too.

267
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,100
Is it true you're not going home
for New Year's?

268
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,600
News sure travels fast.

269
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,100
My mom heard from your mom.

270
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah, there's a lot of reasons for it.

271
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,900
I mean, I just moved,
and the cost of traveling is crazy.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,934
Plus, I've got work.

273
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,767
Why don't you come stay at my place
on New Year's Eve?

274
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,100
-Huh?
-Mom's worried about you.

275
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,500
If you come,
then we'll have New Year's soba together.

276
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,900
Let's do our New Year's shrine visit
at Hachiman too.

277
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
-We went there together last year too.
-Uh-huh.

278
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,767
It doesn't really feel like a new year
unless we go there.

279
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,000
Uh-huh.

280
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:01,734
I guess I'll go.

281
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,667
Tell your mom I'll be there.

282
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,200
Got it.

283
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
OK, remedial lessons are over.

284
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,900
-Yes!
-All right!

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,767
Go ahead and have lots of fun

286
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,400
but don't forget to review
over New Year's.

287
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,900
Ah! Finally, it's over.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,900
Mitsuishi.

289
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,800
-Join us for an end-of-class party?
-Heck yeah. I'll go.

290
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,600
You two are coming too, right?

291
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:34,400
Oh... I'll go.
I've got a little time before work.

292
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,567
That'll be refreshing.
Don't you agree, Marina?

293
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,900
-I'm not going.
-Really?

294
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,500
Come here, Nao... Come with me.

295
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:48,600
What? What? What is it?

296
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,600
What is it? What's wrong?

297
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,834
I need to talk with you
about something alone.

298
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,500
Really?

299
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,000
Wow. I can hardly believe it.

300
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:08,967
Believe what?

301
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,100
That you're living with that stud.

302
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,400
But...

303
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,300
Uehara doesn't find me attractive.

304
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:23,000
It's more like
we just happen to live together.

305
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
And who knows
how long even this will last?

306
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,200
Nao?

307
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,300
Oh, sorry. Forget about my problems.

308
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,300
What is it you wanted to talk about?

309
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,934
Oh, yeah.

310
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:42,200
To tell you the truth, Mitsuishi...

311
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Yes?

312
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,300
He told me he likes me.

313
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,200
Huh? Uh...

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,467
Nao? Hey, Nao!

315
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,834
Really?

316
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,300
-Don't exaggerate so much.
-You've got to be kidding!

317
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,700
It surprised me too.

318
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
-When did he do it?
-Christmas Eve.

319
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,900
-Then he really does love you.
-You think so too?

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,900
-Yes, of course!
-Oh, dear.

321
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,400
I've never thought of Mitsuishi
in that way before.

322
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,600
I mean, there's nothing wrong with him,

323
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,200
but he's also not really handsome.

324
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,900
But, listen to me, Marina.

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,100
You have no idea how much courage it took
for him to tell you that.

326
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
That means he really loves you, Marina.

327
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,100
-I understand that, but...
-But what?

328
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,900
Ah! I don't know what to tell him.

329
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Anyway, I don't dislike Mitsuishi.

330
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,700
I think he's a nice guy.

331
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,500
Think it over,
for Mitsuishi's sake as well.

332
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,500
I will.

333
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,467
Nao!

334
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,934
-I feel so much better now.
-I'm so happy for you.

335
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,600
Here you go, Nao.

336
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,734
-Huh?
-New Year's bonus.

337
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,000
No, I can't accept that from you.

338
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,900
It's hardly anything.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,066
Besides, this is our last day this year.

340
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,300
Oh, Issei. Here's one for you too.

341
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Thank you very much.

342
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
That's how you accept it, obediently.

343
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

344
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,400
-OK, see you next year, Nao.
-Uh-huh.

345
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,200
You two have a happy New Year.

346
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
DECEMBER 30

347
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,734
What was this for?

348
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,467
What are you up to?

349
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,934
Like you said,
I'm doing my New Year's cleaning.

350
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,200
Like they say, "Clean out this year's dirt
before the end of the year."

351
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,667
Cleaning?
Looks more like you're making a mess.

352
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:59,200
How rude! I'm getting rid of the clutter.

353
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,500
Getting rid of clutter?

354
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,500
You take out all of your things

355
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
then separate what you need
from what you don't.

356
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,300
You just moved in. Is that all necessary?
I"m not sure if you're bright,

357
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,667
or if you're stupid.
I'm off to work.

358
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,767
See you... Oh!

359
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,967
-Tomorrow, I'm going to Daichi's place.
-You are?

360
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,100
My mom told Daichi's mom about me

361
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,100
so now I'm going to stay there
for New Year's Eve.

362
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,500
I see. You must be happy.

363
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,767
Besides, I'll be out working.

364
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
<i>Uehara has already promised</i>

365
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,300
to spend the New Year's countdown
with me.

366
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,600
Oh, that's right.

367
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,500
NEW YEAR'S EVE

368
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,100
It's cold.

369
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,300
Guess he's already at work.

370
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,500
Thank you.

371
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,734
Dang, it's cold.

372
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:33,934
Huh?

373
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,900
What?

374
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,400
The lights went out. Oh, no.

375
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,500
Where's the fuse box?

376
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,900
Oh, there it is.

377
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,467
All right.

378
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,934
I think it's this one.

379
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,300
OK. Are they back on?

380
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,100
Huh? How come they're not on?

381
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,867
Manager, I'm here.

382
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:20,567
Oh, Uehara. Is everything OK?

383
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,900
-Huh?
-The blackout.

384
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Isn't that where you live?

385
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh, I've been out since this morning.

386
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,700
Oh, yeah. I was worried about you.

387
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,100
They said the trains had stopped too
because of the blackout.

388
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Well, I'm glad you made it. That's good.

389
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,667
It's so cold.

390
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,367
Oh! That's cold!

391
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Huh? Why is there water here?

392
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,300
What? Oh, no.

393
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,500
Oops!

394
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,000
It's soaking wet here.

395
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,934
It's all melted.

396
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
{\an8}YOSHIKAWA NAO
CONNECTING

397
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,500
<i>Hello, Daichi?</i>

398
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,500
It's me.
Sorry, but I don't think I can make it.

399
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,900
I heard the trains have stopped.
You want me to come get you?

400
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,300
No, it's OK. The power is out here,

401
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
so I think it's better
if I don't leave home.

402
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,467
-<i>The power's out?</i>
-Uh-huh.

403
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:34,700
But I'm sure it'll come back on again
pretty soon.

404
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,467
<i>All right. I see.</i>

405
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Is he there? Uehara?

406
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,567
No.

407
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,300
I don't think he's coming home today.

408
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,300
I see.

409
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,800
But I'm perfectly fine.
I don't mind being home at all.

410
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,000
OK, I see. Bye.

411
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,934
Oh, Daichi. Have a happy New Year.

412
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,767
Have a happy New Year too.

413
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,467
Bye.

414
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:22,734
It sure is cold.

415
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:25,800
Come to think of it,

416
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,600
the second-floor room will become vacant
next month.

417
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,900
So it's true.

418
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
-Oh, did Nanako say something?
-Yeah.

419
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
But I didn't think it was true.

420
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,767
Well, usually I rent it for $700.

421
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
-But for you, I'll rent it for $500.
-Really?

422
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
But I can't pay for moving cost, though.

423
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,100
You're paying, what,
$700 to $800 now, right?

424
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:48,900
Yes.

425
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:52,867
In the long run,
it's best to move to a cheaper place.

426
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,500
And I'll provide meals here too.

427
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:59,200
But there is that pesky one here.

428
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>There has been a large scale blackout
in parts of the Tokyo area.</i>

429
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,200
<i>The power company says
that the power lines have been damaged.</i>

430
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
<i>However, they don't know what caused it.</i>

431
00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:18,100
<i>Without any idea when the power
will be back on, there are 3,500--</i>

432
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,100
{\an8}Have a happy New Year!

433
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,600
{\an8}Best wishes for the New Year.

434
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
{\an8}Are you OK, Nao?

435
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,867
{\an8}It's going to run out of power.

436
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,867
PLEASE CHARGE YOUR PHONE.
20% OF BATTERY REMAINING.

437
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,400
OK, I've got to turn it off
in case I need it for an emergency.

438
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,400
SHUTTING DOWN

439
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,400
Sorry everyone.

440
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,834
It's so cold.

441
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,767
I didn't know it could get so cold
with the power out.

442
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,000
I wish Uehara would come home.

443
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,800
You may as well go home.

444
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:28,867
But there might still be customers.

445
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,500
I'll still pay you
for the hours you're scheduled for.

446
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,100
Take it easy on New Year's Eve, at least.

447
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,100
I appreciate it. Thank you.

448
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,100
We're closed tomorrow, New Year's Day.
Don't come in by mistake.

449
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,367
OK.

450
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,734
Manager,
thank you for all you've done this year.

451
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,600
You have a happy New Year.

452
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,000
I will.

453
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,400
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached</i>

454
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,100
<i>because it has been switched off or--</i>

455
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
I wish I could tell everyone,
"Happy New Year."

456
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,000
{\an8}DAICHI, DAICHI, DAICHI,
MOM, MOM, MARINA

457
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,800
{\an8}DAICHI, DAICHI,
UEHARA, DAICHI, DAICHI

458
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:30,700
Oh.

459
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
UEHARA

460
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,834
Uehara called me.

461
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,100
Oh, please. Go through.

462
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,200
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Oh!

463
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,000
Hello. Uehara?

464
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,667
Where are you now?

465
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,200
I heard the power's out at home.

466
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:01,500
Uh-huh. It's really terrible...

467
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,667
Huh? Are you OK?

468
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

469
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,300
Enjoy the New Year countdown.

470
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
OK, bye.

471
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,500
Oh!

472
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,300
<i>Uehara.</i>

473
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah?

474
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,467
Have a happy New Year.

475
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,300
Have a happy New Year.

476
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,100
Ouch! Oh, oops.

477
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,834
Nao? You here?

478
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,967
Yeah, I knew she wouldn't be.

479
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,867
I'm here.

480
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,367
What are you doing here?

481
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
I couldn't help it.

482
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,200
Weren't you staying over somewhere?

483
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,200
The trains aren't running.

484
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,300
And the blackout caused problems
with the fridge.

485
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
Then why didn't you tell me?

486
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,600
I thought it was odd your phone cut out
all of a sudden.

487
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,767
But I thought you were spending
the countdown at Nanako's.

488
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
I didn't want to bother you at work.

489
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:09,100
-What about you, Uehara?
-What about me?

490
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,400
From the start, I said...

491
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,367
I told you to lean on me, right?

492
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,667
-It sure is cold.
-Uh-huh.

494
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,767
Oh, it's lit.

495
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,000
I got this candle
at my brother's wedding.

496
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,500
It's pretty.

497
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,667
I thought about throwing it away.
Never expected it to be of use.

498
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,800
It's nice, warm and bright.

499
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,400
OK, I'm going to sleep here tonight.

500
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,967
Wait, Uehara.

501
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,000
Huh? What happened?

502
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,834
Did I do something stupid again?

503
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,200
But what?

504
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,700
If we're both in the same room,
that'll make it warmer.

505
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,200
He's so close.

506
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,300
You changed?

507
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
Of course. I'm going to bed, after all.

508
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,600
Oh, yeah. You're right.

509
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Man, it's cold.

510
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,200
-Don't you worry.
-What?

511
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,834
I won't try anything with you.

512
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,100
I know that.

513
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Of all people,

514
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,100
I know best just how unattractive
you think I am.

515
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,734
Don't you worry either.

516
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,300
At the very least, I don't even expect you
to do anything like that.

517
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,734
I know that.

518
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,000
Are you asleep, Uehara?

519
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,667
Yep.

520
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,300
Uhm...

521
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,300
Did you leave home

522
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,767
because Yuri
and your brother got married?

523
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,567
Why are you asking that now?

524
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,200
I mean, you work so many jobs

525
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,000
and suffer things you don't have to,
so you could leave home...

526
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,800
I just thought it must have taken
a lot of resolve to do that.

527
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,900
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's none of my business, is it?

528
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,400
Let me ask you this.

529
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:11,000
If you loved someone who didn't love you
for eight years,

530
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,867
then that person got married
to someone else,

531
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,100
could you be around them
and still act normal?

532
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
That's why I did it.

533
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,400
Won't you ever see your brother again?

534
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,567
Yes, I will. It's not like I hate him.

535
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,200
You see...

536
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,500
the problem is my own.

537
00:35:56,967 --> 00:36:01,300
However... I never plan on returning home.

538
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,200
Good night.

539
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,500
Good night.

540
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,900
Oh!

541
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,800
What?

542
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:25,100
-Is it past midnight?
-Way past.

543
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:30,100
Happy New Year, Uehara.

544
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,000
Best wishes in the new year.

545
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,467
I'll try not to be too hard on you either.

546
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm going to sleep now.

547
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,200
OK, me too.

548
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,800
Ah, they came on. I'm so glad.

549
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:34,900
-I wonder if the trains are running.
-Why? Are you going somewhere?

550
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:37,967
Uh-huh. Daichi invited me to go
to a New Year's shrine visit together.

551
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,567
Oh, you want to come too?

552
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,100
It's the New Year, and I think it's best
to do that kind of thing.

553
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
You're probably right.

554
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,367
-What? You'll come?
-You don't want me to?

555
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,767
Not at all.

556
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:55,500
No, not at all. Let's go!

557
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,500
<i>Darn it, Uehara.</i>

558
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,500
<i>Your dithering has made us late.</i>

559
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,667
-You've got no right to say that.
-Why?

560
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:07,100
-You only told me this morning.
-But you said you wanted to come.

561
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
You should have told me yesterday.

562
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,066
Oh, give me a break.

563
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,300
Daichi.

564
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,400
Happy New Year.

565
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,967
Best wishes in the new year.

566
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,700
I brought Uehara along.

567
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,934
-Hi.
-Hi.

568
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,900
Was everything OK with the blackout?

569
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,934
Uh-huh, after Uehara came back home.

570
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,700
Thanks.

571
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,367
No big deal.
I just came to my own place.

572
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:35,400
That's right.
You're acting like my parent, Daichi.

573
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,000
I should have gone over myself.

574
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,367
No, it's all right.
Sorry for causing you to worry.

575
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
That was a long prayer.

576
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,834
I probably overdid it for one dollar.

577
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,000
Nao.

578
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,000
I wanted to talk to you
about something the other day.

579
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,100
Yes?

580
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,300
Uh, I'll tell you later.

581
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:44,600
OK.

582
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:50,100
I want a good luck charm.

583
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
You should get one for safety
when traveling.

584
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:53,667
Good idea.

585
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,367
Oh, it's Mitsuishi.

586
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,867
Oh my god!

587
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,500
Oh, no!

588
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:14,200
Uh, I wish you all the best
in the new year, Nao.

589
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,700
Marina, did you...

590
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,367
We're... going together now.

591
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Congratulations.

592
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,200
Thank you. This is thanks to you, Nao.

593
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,734
Is that right?

594
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:36,800
What? Why are you crying?

595
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,834
-Seriously?
-I'm just so happy.

596
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:43,967
-Oh gosh, here.
-Thank you.

597
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,000
-Oh, you. Thank you so much.
-Congratulations.

598
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,200
Mitsuishi getting that Great Fortune
was so perfect.

599
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,834
Who's Mitsuishi?

600
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,200
-What? You don't know?
-No.

601
00:40:57,667 --> 00:41:00,500
He's been around since school started.

602
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
-Huh?
-Crap.

603
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:04,900
Crap.

604
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,200
Make yourselves at home.

605
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,000
<i>You're so mean, Uehara.</i>

606
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,667
Huh?

607
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,800
We're supposed to
do the New Years count down together.

608
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,567
You decided on that by yourself.

609
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,900
I can't stand this.

610
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,100
Why? Why do you live with her?

611
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,100
I've known you so much longer than her.

612
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:48,000
And I love you so much more than her.

613
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:51,900
Move over to our place, Uehara.

614
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,500
<i>The second-floor room is only $500.</i>

615
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,300
<i>It'll be cheaper than this place
and easier to work there, right?</i>

616
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
Your dad already told me that.

617
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:02,700
Then--

618
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:03,834
I turned him down.

619
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:08,100
<i>Why?</i>

620
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,400
<i>I'm still in high school
and renting a new place isn't easy.</i>

621
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
I'm sure Dad will do something
to make it easier--

622
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,967
Besides...

623
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,300
I enjoy living here.

624
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,400
<i>I have no intention of moving.</i>

625
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,467
<i>All right, now that you know how I feel,
get home and study for entrance exams.</i>

626
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,400
Nao.

627
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,567
-I'm going to make dinner. You want some?
-Uhm...

628
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,400
I know you haven't realized this,
so I'm going to tell you.

629
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,667
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
