1
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:18,700
I'm Kitaura Nozomi.

2
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:22,867
{\an8}So, what did you want to talk to me about?

3
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,867
{\an8}Is it true...

4
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:29,333
{\an8}that you're dating Uehara Hisashi?

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Huh?

6
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,934
It's a simple question.

7
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:40,700
Just say yes if it's true,
or no if it's not.

8
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,266
Which is it?

9
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,033
I can hardly see a thing from here.

10
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:58,800
Me... and Uehara...

11
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,200
are dating.

12
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,700
I see.

13
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:14,066
Then I just might cause you some trouble.

14
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,967
You see...

15
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:25,000
Uehara Hisashi is the one person
I will never forgive.

16
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:33,166
That diabolical man deprived me
of my happiness.

17
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,066
Uh-oh! Hey!

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,567
How are you? Are you okay?

19
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,100
Yes, I'm fine.

20
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,000
OK, bye.

21
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:15,233
Oh my god.
I could fall in love with her.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Nao.

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
Marina.

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,567
You OK?

25
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:55,967
Hey, you!

26
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:02,767
You still remember me, don't you?

27
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,800
Who are you?

28
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,367
Even from a woman's perspective,
that girl is pretty fascinating.

29
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,967
Oh! I'd better add her to my list.

30
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,333
-You're so unfaithful to me.
-Huh?

31
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:11,333
All that stuff about not forgiving him

32
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,166
and having her happiness snatched away...

33
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,567
then something must have happened
between them.

34
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,300
Nao, has he ever said anything about her?

35
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,700
No, I guess he hasn't.

36
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,967
Well, you know how Uehara never talks
about himself.

37
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,066
Yeah! That's right! He doesn't!

38
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,934
Besides, he's not the type
to do anything mean to anyone.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,967
It's probably just a simple
misunderstanding.

40
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,667
Really?

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,200
Well, I am his girlfriend, after all.

42
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:50,166
So, I really ought to trust my boyfriend.

43
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,400
You've really matured, Nao.

44
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:57,300
I want us to be more like you
and Mitsuishi.

45
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,066
What do you mean by that?

46
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,266
Usually you two argue.

47
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,734
But, like when you were
on the Ferris wheel

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,867
and the two of you are alone...
You know what I mean?

49
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:13,767
You saw that?

50
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,600
-Of course I saw.
-Really?

51
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,934
I saw it too.

52
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,100
-Ow!
-Why were you looking?

53
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,834
From appearances,
you don't seem to get along.

54
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,567
But actually, you've got
a close relationship with each other.

55
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,667
We don't seem to get along?
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.

56
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,367
Anyway,
you two will become like that in no time.

57
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:39,467
I mean, think of all the ordeals
you've gone through together.

58
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,033
Yeah, I guess so.

59
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,033
I do have to admit that we've become
more settled and comfortable as a couple.

60
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,934
<i>That Kitaura, the transfer student,</i>

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,533
<i>she's got such a great figure
and is totally cool.</i>

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,700
She and Uehara were arguing,
so do you think they used to be a couple?

63
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:57,967
Could be!
I mean, they're both so calm and cool.

64
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,600
Uh, Nao, I don't think you should let
that kind of talk get to you.

65
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,700
It isn't! It doesn't bother me at all!
Not in the least!

66
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,867
Oh, let's get studying, everyone!

67
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:13,066
Come on everyone! Let's study.
I love studying!

68
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,967
Oh, dear! I've just got to study!

69
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,834
-It's upside-down.
-She's totally losing it.

70
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,333
Really?
You don't know a thing about Kitaura?

71
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,266
I told you, I don't know her.

72
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,467
Did something happen between you two,
but you totally forgot about it?

73
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,900
No, I guess you're right.
Nothing happened.

74
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,100
She just came up to me and declared war.

75
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,400
Declared war?

76
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,600
Yeah, like, "I'm going to crush you."

77
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,667
I can't believe
that Kitaura would pick a fight with you.

78
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:47,066
-Jeez, what a pain in the ass.
-Huh?

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,533
I've made up my mind about her.

80
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,934
I'm never having anything to do
with her again.

81
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,834
Oh...

82
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,967
I see! Good! Good!

83
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:02,900
What're you smiling about?

84
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, uh...

85
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,633
I'm not smiling about anything.

86
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,934
She's quite a lot of trouble, isn't she?
Yes, a lot of trouble.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,333
<i>Nao!</i>

88
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,867
-Oh, Issei.
-Glad I ran into you.

89
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,600
Thanks for going out with me
the other day.

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,333
-It's roast pork.
-What? Really?

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
Roast pork?

92
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,567
Enjoy it together. See you.

93
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:27,867
Thank you.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,100
Wow, this is really nice.

95
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,767
-Let's make fried rice with it.
-No, way.

96
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,900
-We're making pork roast steaks.
-No! Fried rice!

97
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,633
What're you talking about?
Pork roast steaks!

98
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,533
-I say fried rice!
-And I say pork roast steaks!

99
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,400
OK, back to work. Back to work!

100
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,033
<i>Just slice it up into steaks.</i>

101
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,467
<i>You've never even cut one of these!</i>

102
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,767
<i>Yes, I have.
We're having pork roast steaks.</i>

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,967
<i>Just look how good it is!</i>

104
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,600
<i>-I'm telling you, fried rice!
-No! Pork roast steaks!</i>

105
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,266
A FEW DAYS LATER

106
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,266
UEHARA VS. KITAURA

107
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,967
BRAVO!

108
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,133
EXCELLENT!

109
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,567
YEA! YEA!

110
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:46,667
YOU'RE A REAL PAIN!

111
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,533
I WILL CRUSH YOU.

112
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,834
Kitaura and Uehara were at it again today.

113
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,500
Those two should become a couple.

114
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,166
-Yeah! They're a perfect match.
-Oh, no!

115
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,133
Yeah!

116
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
<i>Uehara and Kitaura are such a great match.</i>

117
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,266
I totally see it!
It's like he lets her do that to him.

118
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,934
-Oh, totally!
-I told you!

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,734
Oh, dear!

120
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,367
What is it?

121
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,033
Oh... uh... well...

122
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:45,266
I was just wondering how you
and that Kitaura are getting along lately.

123
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh... I was just kidding.

124
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,367
Sorry! Sorry about that.

125
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,867
Good night.

126
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,467
Oh! That's right.

127
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:03,967
Tomorrow's Saturday. I'm off work.
What about you?

128
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm working.

129
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,300
Figures...

130
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,133
Oh, of course.

131
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,834
He and Kitaura are enemies, after all.

132
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,367
It's all right, I think.

133
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,333
Not even!

134
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,300
You're so naive, Nao!

135
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:36,767
You have no idea what love can do!

136
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:41,900
As usual, you sure are frank
about your thoughts, Marina.

137
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:46,533
Love that has it's seeds in hate
is the kind that becomes the strongest.

138
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,934
Just like someone you and I both know.

139
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,767
Huh?

140
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:55,100
Oh, yeah. Uehara.
You said you wanted a computer, right?

141
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,033
Yes.

142
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,567
This new customer here says
she's getting rid of her old one--

143
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,834
Please introduce me to her!

144
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:06,667
Oh, sure. She always comes
when you're not here, so I'll get her--

145
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,467
-Welcome!
-Welco...

146
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,800
What perfect timing!

147
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,800
We were just talking about you, Kitaura.

148
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:19,700
You mean...

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,300
<i>Try to remember.</i>

150
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:28,233
You yourself, Nao,
what did you think of Uehara at first?

151
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:34,000
He was stuck up...
and cruel, and ticked me off.

152
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,700
And what do you think now?

153
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:42,600
I think he's super nice and kind.

154
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,867
I'm... in love with him.

155
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:50,767
See!

156
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,066
Oh, no!

157
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,133
Attraction is way greater

158
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,967
when you go from hating a guy
to seeing how great he is

159
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,500
than when he's a nice guy from the start.

160
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:04,600
You mean, that's likely to happen
between Uehara and Kitaura?

161
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:09,400
From my perspective,
it's totally going to happen between them.

162
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
She's the one with the computer--

163
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,867
-Forget it!
-That was fast!

164
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,233
I'm never going to let this guy have it.

165
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,533
-Sorry.
-Oh, I see.

166
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,033
You're just going to throw it away, right?

167
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,900
Then give it to me. I'll buy it!

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,734
It's a Pro Graphics
High Spec Processor model.

169
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,433
-What would an amateur do with--
-Are you kidding me?

170
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Is that the rumored limited edition model?

171
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah... it is.

172
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:45,667
<i>Oh, god! No!</i>

173
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:49,367
-That's horrible!
-I told you.

174
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:52,767
And they seem so much alike.

175
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,433
What if they both have the same interests
and suddenly hit it off?

176
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,433
If they hit it off?

177
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,533
It'll be too late.

178
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,467
-Oh, no.
-Nao!

179
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:19,433
I used to absolutely hate your guts.

180
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,900
But now...

181
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,200
Me too. I wanted to crush you.

182
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,567
But now...

183
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,233
Who's that?

184
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,500
She's the person
who does all the housework around here.

185
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,934
You're amazing, Kitaura. I learned a lot.

186
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,033
I'm nothing special at all.

187
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,667
So, if you play a game with SXGA running

188
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,433
-it reduces performance?
-That's right!

189
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,467
That's what I couldn't under...

190
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,266
Huh?

191
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,767
<i>What are they doing together?</i>

192
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,400
And it looks like they're hitting it off!

193
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,834
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

194
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,266
I think the CXKP...

195
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
What are you doing there?

196
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,033
What a coincidence.

197
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,834
Yes, a real coincidence.

198
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:39,266
The stuff he does is real hit or miss.

199
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,333
Yeah, you're right.

200
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,700
But when he works with Woodman--

201
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:42,967
-It works!
-It sure does!

202
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,867
The power and pace are totally different.

203
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,233
Yeah, that's so true. Isn't it?

204
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,834
Are you going to see him this summer?

205
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,433
Of course. You are too, aren't you?

206
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,367
Yeah.

207
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,767
There's quite a lineup this summer.

208
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:56,066
I want to see that match too.

209
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,633
-It's a movie.
-Huh?

210
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,967
A movie.

211
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:06,133
Oh, I was confused, I guess.

212
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,967
If it's that amazing,

213
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,967
then I'd like to see it with you.

214
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,900
Movies are meant to be watched alone.

215
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:14,433
-You can't focus with someone next to you.
-Totally.

216
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,066
It's especially impossible
if it's someone you know.

217
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,066
And those people who eat popcorn
all through the movie.

218
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,567
Yeah! It's like, why'd they come
to the movie if they're going to do that?

219
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,400
And there're the type
that always spills stuff too.

220
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,934
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong with you?

221
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,433
Fighting with your boyfriend again?

222
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,734
-Can I ask you something, Issei?
-Yeah.

223
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,100
Do you know the names
of foreign movie directors?

224
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,333
No idea.

225
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,633
Do you eat popcorn in the movie theater?

226
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,100
Of course I do!

227
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,900
Popcorn and a giant soda are essential!

228
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,834
I couldn't agree more!

229
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:04,166
I didn't realize Issei
and I had so much in common.

230
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:14,633
Huh?

231
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,500
Aren't you working today?

232
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm off. What about you?

233
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:23,600
-I'm working.
-Oh. See you later.

234
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,700
We only see each other in passing.

235
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:37,633
Uhm, can I ask you about Kitaura?

236
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,133
Yeah?

237
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,867
You two came to terms, didn't you?

238
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,233
Yeah, I guess so.

239
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,667
It's not like we were fighting anyway.

240
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:51,800
She's a pretty nice person.

241
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,934
I see.

242
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,333
Well, that's good.

243
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,166
OK, see you later.

244
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:13,233
<i>You'll get run over
if you keep looking down like that.</i>

245
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, Issei. Good morning.

246
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,467
Morning.

247
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,834
I don't share any of the same interests
at all with Uehara.

248
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,266
Yeah, you're right.

249
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,867
You sure are frank, aren't you, Issei?

250
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:30,100
There's no point in lying about it.

251
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,500
Jeez... I guess I'm going to have to
study up on movie directors and stuff.

252
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,400
But I get sleepy
when I watch complex movies.

253
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,700
And the stuff Uehara's into is niche.

254
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,433
What's the big problem with that?

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,767
-Huh?
-You know the saying.

256
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,066
"If you're always together,
you grow more and more alike."

257
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,533
It happens to lovers and married couples.

258
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,266
Married couples?

259
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,266
Don't overreact to some particular words.

260
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,567
Well, anyway...

261
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,066
When you're with someone for a long time

262
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:06,367
your looks and character,
and the pace that you do things,

263
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,100
will all become more and more alike.

264
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,567
Don't let what's happening
right now bother you so much.

265
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,100
You've already got what's most important.

266
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:15,567
I do?

267
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,333
You're more honest
and faithful to him than anyone else.

268
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,600
Yeah.

269
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,600
If you've got that,
you don't need anything else.

270
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,200
Just be who you are, Nao.

271
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:35,867
Thank you, Issei.

272
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:45,266
Besides, fate smiles
on those that work hard, right?

273
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,700
And even when things aren't working out

274
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,900
well... you know...

275
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:56,033
you can come talk to me.
I'll listen to your troubles...

276
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:59,066
She's not even listening to me.

277
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,400
OK.

278
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:04,033
Oh, sorry about that, Issei.

279
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,266
Huh? What is it?

280
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,100
That's another thing
that makes you unique.

281
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,400
Thank you.

282
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,834
Thanks for waiting for me.

283
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,066
No big deal. I was free anyway.

284
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,467
Oh, about your computer...

285
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,133
I haven't given you my OK on that!

286
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
-Forget about it, anyway.
-What?

287
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,700
I think it's something
that I should buy myself.

288
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,333
-Don't you ever wonder about it?
-About what?

289
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,467
-About why I'm fighting with you.
-Oh, that.

290
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,734
-You've completely forgotten, haven't you?
-Yeah.

291
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,233
You're a nicer guy
than I thought you were.

292
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,700
YOIASA SHOPPING STREET LOTTERY

293
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,400
I never thought you'd be interested
in this kind of thing.

294
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,667
I want fifth prize.

295
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,500
Fifth prize?

296
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,233
FIFTH PRIZE

297
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,533
{\an8}ONE MONTH SUPPLY OF MILK PUDDING

298
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,367
I know somebody
who loves that stuff like crazy.

299
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,734
<i>Nao!</i>

300
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:45,734
Yes?

301
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,533
Here.

302
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,133
Huh? What's this?

303
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,233
I won it at the lottery.

304
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,867
But I can't close the shop to go.

305
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,667
COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS

306
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,500
"Ikaho hot spring"?

307
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,834
Think of it as my way of saying thanks
for the hard work you do every day.

308
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,233
What? Really? I can have this?

309
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Thank you so much!

310
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,867
Fate is finally smiling on me!

311
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,967
You win first prize!

312
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,800
Congratulations.

313
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,166
{\an8}"A pair of tickets for Ikaho hot spring."

314
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:29,967
{\an8}You should go with your girlfriend.

315
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,467
You can have it.

316
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,467
-What?
-Take it before I change my mind.

317
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,734
Here.

318
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,567
See you later.

319
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:43,100
You win the milk pudding! Congratulations!

320
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,700
Ta-da!

321
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,266
I bet you're surprised.

322
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:54,066
Yeah, way more than you can imagine.

323
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:57,200
Let's go
during the next three-day weekend.

324
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,266
With whom?

325
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:04,600
What do you mean "whom"?
There's only you.

326
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,333
-Just the two of us?
-Uh-huh.

327
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,233
Oh... I see.

328
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,767
I'm looking forward to it.

329
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,633
This really must be my reward
for my hard work every day.

330
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,600
Don't forget to get the day off
from your work.

331
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,133
Yeah.

332
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,000
OK, I'm going to bed.

333
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,533
Don't get yourself injured
before we go on this trip.

334
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:36,800
Give me a break.

335
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,233
Oh, this looks nice.

336
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,333
She has no idea what she's saying.
I'm sure of it.

337
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:45,967
I'm going to bed.

338
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,667
I feel stupid worrying over it.

339
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,967
Oh! This place looks nice.

340
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,300
I'd love to go there with Uehara.

341
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,367
Oh! Konnyaku balls.

342
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,700
GUNMA, IKAHO

343
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,767
{\an8}What's that? Are you going on a trip?

344
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,433
{\an8}Uh-huh. With Uehara.

345
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,233
Really?

346
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,266
Don't tell me you're staying overnight.

347
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,333
Uh-huh.

348
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,166
What?

349
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,467
What?

350
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,100
Oh, Look at this.
These konnyaku balls look delicious.

351
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,066
You've got to be kidding me!
You never told me about that, Nao!

352
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,433
What? What? Ow! That hurts!
What's wrong all of a sudden?

353
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:00,300
Why didn't you tell me that you two had
that kind of relationship?

354
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:04,200
I feel so stupid
that I avoided the subject all this time.

355
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,166
What's wrong with you?

356
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,633
What kind of relationship are you
talking about?

357
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:11,100
-What? Are you serious?
-Yes.

358
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,667
OK, that's it! Get over here!

359
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:15,767
-Right now!
-Jeez!

360
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:21,266
What?

361
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,300
What do you mean "what"?
That's what I want to say!

362
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,667
Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

363
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,800
But, we aren't like that at all!

364
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:34,400
What's going on? What's up with you?

365
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
What did you do this time, Nao?

366
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,734
-It's nothing!
-It's nothing!

367
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,533
Of course that's what it seems like.

368
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
I mean, you're staying overnight, right?

369
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,333
Yeah, I guess you're right.

370
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:56,033
I was so excited about taking a trip
with him...

371
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,834
That you didn't think about that.

372
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,600
How poor Uehara is!

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,667
What should I do?

374
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:12,667
There's nothing you <i>can</i> do.

375
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:15,533
You may as well get on with it
now that you've come this far.

376
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,333
What? Oh, no! No way!

377
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Jeez! That's disgusting! And cold!

378
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,100
Oh! I'm sorry!

379
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,767
What's wrong with you?

380
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,133
Ouch!

381
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,500
You're the one
who won't be able to go on the trip.

382
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,567
I'm just fine!

383
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,066
Ow!

384
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,033
Oh, dear!

385
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,867
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

386
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:17,767
Oh, dear!

387
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,367
Oh! I know!

388
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,400
That's it!

389
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,100
That's what I can do!

390
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,867
That's what I'll do!

391
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,133
Yea!

392
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,300
Uehara!

393
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,967
What are you going to wear tomorrow?
It's still cold up in the mountains.

394
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:44,934
What?

395
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,166
It's my first time
to go to a hot spring resort.

396
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,567
I'm looking forward to it.

397
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,467
Well, Nao, she, uh...

398
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,567
she said that it would be more fun
if we all went together.

399
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,400
Really?

400
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,934
Please! Come with us, Marina!

401
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:10,400
It says up to six people is OK.
Invite Mitsuishi too!

402
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,800
But it would be unfair to Uehara.

403
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,100
You and Mitsuishi can go
to a hot spring resort for free!

404
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,934
Huh?

405
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:27,400
Well, you know, when we get there,

406
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:30,633
we'll split up
and go around just as couples.

407
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,967
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yeah!

408
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,233
-That's what we'll do!
-Oh!

409
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,867
There you all are!

410
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:40,066
Let's decide who's in charge of what
on the trip. I'll take care of snacks.

411
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
-You're going too?
-Naturally!

412
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:45,500
-I'd like to punch your lights out.
-Huh?

413
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,333
Never mind.

414
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,266
I'm...

415
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,166
home.

416
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,367
There's something you need to tell me,
isn't there?

417
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:02,767
Oh...

418
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,400
You mean, about tomorrow?

419
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,567
Since when did this become a group tour?

420
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,734
Well, you see...

421
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,000
The voucher...

422
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,166
Issei's dad gave it to me.

423
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,734
It said that it was good
for up to six people.

424
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,767
What?

425
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,100
Don't tell me
the ramen shop owner is coming too.

426
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,266
No, he has to run the shop.

427
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:37,667
So Issei is coming instead.

428
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,467
Sorry.

429
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,233
I was going to tell you.

430
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,600
-Forget it.
-Huh?

431
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,867
I'm not going tomorrow.

432
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,734
What? Wait a second! Why?

433
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,100
I hate being in a big group on a trip.

434
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,333
Invite someone else.

435
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:57,734
You can't be serious.

436
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:05,800
Hello?

437
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,100
Tomorrow?

438
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,333
Yeah, I guess so.

439
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,967
OK. I'll be there. Good bye.

440
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:24,033
What? Where are you going tomorrow?

441
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,667
I've got work at the gas station.

442
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,900
Another guy can't come in,
so they asked me to work instead.

443
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:32,834
You're so horrible.

444
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,300
How can you suddenly cancel like that--

445
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,900
You've got no right to say that!

446
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:43,266
If you didn't want to be alone with me,
then you should have just told me.

447
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,900
It's not like I didn't want to.

448
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,667
It's just that the two of us alone...

449
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,066
I mean...

450
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
You see...

451
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,800
Then just tell me that.

452
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:07,166
But to decide it all on your own,
and go around changing it...

453
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,834
That means you're only thinking
about yourself.

454
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,667
Uhm, Uehara.

455
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,000
Sorry, but I've got to get to work.

456
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,800
-Where's Issei?
-He went to look for them.

457
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,700
They aren't upstairs.

458
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:14,166
What are those two doing? They're so late.

459
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:17,300
-Maybe because it's cloudy.
-What's that got to do with it?

460
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,133
-It does, a little.
-You think so?

461
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,133
-Maybe not.
-They're not that kind.

462
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,400
Nao!

463
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,433
-Huh?
-There she is!

464
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,300
What are you doing over there, Nao?

465
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,300
Huh? Where's Uehara?

466
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,333
Oh, dear.

467
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,033
Well, I can pretty much figure out
what happened between you.

468
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:53,900
But what's happened has happened.

469
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,100
That's right! That's right!

470
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,266
Uehara's never going to come
if you just sit there.

471
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,433
Yeah, you're right.

472
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,233
Cheer up, and let's go!

473
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:10,433
Ikaho! Ikaho! Ikaho!

474
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,533
-This way?
-No, that way!

475
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,834
That way? Really?

476
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,867
Must be rough having a fight
when they live together.

477
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,934
What? Nao and her boyfriend live together?

478
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,767
Huh? You didn't know about that?

479
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,367
No.

480
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:33,433
Mitsuishi! Mitsuishi! Here!

481
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
FOR IKAHO HOT SPRING

482
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,800
-You want one, Nao?
-No, I'm OK.

483
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,367
Can't she even clean up after herself?

484
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
We're going here together for sure!

485
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,600
<i>-You want one, Issei?
-Yeah.</i>

486
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:45,734
-Wow! It's so beautiful!
-Wow!

487
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,300
Dang, it's cold!

488
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:53,667
Oh! Hey, Nao!
Let me see that travel guide.

489
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,834
OK.

490
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,700
I wasn't thinking when I left home.

491
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:04,200
What? Are you serious? Oh, no!

492
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,066
Marina! There's an information booth.

493
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,567
Oh! An information booth!

494
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:09,667
-Oh, Abe!
-Huh?

495
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,433
We can walk while eating.
I'll try for an indirect kiss!

496
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,867
{\an8}A relaxing foot bath. We can snuggle!

497
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,166
I'll buy the good luck charm
for couples!

498
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,367
Free refills! We've got to go!
Can I take it home?

499
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,533
We'll really get in the mood here.
Must check it out!

500
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,767
{\an8}We'll take a photo together here!

501
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,066
Uehara will love this!

502
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,300
I want to go here together!

503
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,033
{\an8}We surely got to be alone here!

504
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,633
You want my konnyaku balls?

505
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,567
Yeah!

506
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,767
It's delicious!

507
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,100
<i>Uehara?</i>

508
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,233
Are you going somewhere too?

509
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,633
Uh, yeah. What about you?

510
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:30,834
Yeah. With that prize you gave me.
I thought I'd go have a good time.

511
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:35,200
Oh... That...

512
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,867
I'll take a photo for you.

513
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:40,900
OK! Ikaho!

514
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:44,767
OK. Got it.

515
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,533
-How do I see it?
-Is the picture good?

516
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,100
Nao.

517
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,433
-How do you see it?
-Don't you know?

518
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,233
I'm her servant.

519
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,967
OK, got it.

520
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,266
That hurts my knees.

521
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,567
-You're next, Nao.
-Me?

522
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,166
-I don't need one.
-Get over there!

523
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,900
-Smile!
-Smile!

524
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,533
OK.

525
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,333
Come on, smile! Here we go!

526
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,433
Thank you!

527
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,033
Hey! Wait for me!

528
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,300
IKAHO HOT SPRING

529
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,367
OK.

530
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:33,867
KAORI RAMEN

531
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,333
Sorry. I recommended this place,
but if you don't like it...

532
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,967
No! It's delicious! Really, it is!

533
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,633
Oh, I forgot to add pepper.

534
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,133
It needs pepper.

535
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,066
Hey! Stop! That's too much!

536
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,867
It won't taste any good.

537
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:02,467
Nao's forcing herself to have a good time.

538
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,734
She's totally missing Uehara.

539
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,767
Oh, well. I guess I'd better help her out.

540
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,500
I'll send this to Uehara.

541
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:20,734
Uehara couldn't resist this.

542
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,900
It'll break his heart
to see Nao looking like this.

543
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:27,066
-She's smiling, but...
-Her eyes are crying.

544
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:30,533
Wait a minute. You know Uehara's number?

545
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,767
Of course! We're best friends.

546
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,133
-Go for it, Abe!
-Got it!

547
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,500
But Uehara never replies very fast.

548
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:40,166
Don't expect an answer soon.

549
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,767
I'm still eating.

550
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,200
Don't force yourself to eat it, Nao.

551
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,166
No, I'm not forcing myself.

552
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,467
Like they say,
powerful food is good for the heart and--

553
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,000
Nao!

554
00:37:58,767 --> 00:37:59,600
What is it?

555
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,200
Uehara is on his way here!

556
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,467
-Aren't you coming, Uehara?
-I'll be there by this evening.

557
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,200
He is?

558
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,300
Yep.

559
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,433
I... I'll go and wait for him!

560
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,033
Oh! Whoa! OK. Sorry.
Let me get out of the way.

561
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,967
-Be careful.
-OK.

562
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,967
That's the best smile she's had all day.

563
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,633
<i>It's so easy to tell what she's thinking.</i>

564
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,867
<i>What time will Uehara get here?</i>

565
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,967
<i>-Uh...
-I don't know.</i>

566
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:32,400
<i>Really?</i>

567
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,533
Nao could be waiting there forever.

568
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,233
Nothing wrong with that.

569
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,233
It's pretty fun waiting
for someone you love.

570
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,633
<i>You say some pretty great things
sometimes.</i>

571
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,433
Hey, Nao.

572
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,767
Oh! Uehara!

573
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,100
You've been waiting a while, haven't you?
You must be cold.

574
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,633
Here. Put on my coat.

575
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,367
No, it's all right, Uehara.

576
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,533
No, I want you to wear it.

577
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,667
Thank you, Uehara.

578
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,066
You're so kind.

579
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,233
But really, you don't have to.

580
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,700
Score!

581
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,567
No, really! It's OK!

582
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:42,333
<i>Hey, you!</i>

583
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,533
You've been waiting for a while.
Aren't you cold?

584
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,767
Oh. I'm fine.

585
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,834
When I move around like this,
I can stay warm.

586
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,834
OK. But don't catch a cold.

587
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:54,967
Here you go. It's fresh cooked, and warm.

588
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:57,200
Really? Are you sure?

589
00:39:58,033 --> 00:39:59,166
Thank you so much!

590
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,633
Is that Nao?

591
00:40:15,633 --> 00:40:16,467
Yeah.

592
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,900
I guess you like girls
that are a little weird.

593
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:32,400
Oh!

594
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,367
Uehara!

595
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,633
-Everybody's looking at you.
-Really?

596
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,166
I guess I went a little overboard.

597
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,433
Jeez!

598
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:50,533
What?

599
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,834
Well...

600
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,433
I was just glad that you came.

601
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:59,033
Yeah, well, my job ended pretty early.

602
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,066
I see. That's great.

603
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,667
Thank you.

604
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:14,300
You totally look like a Daruma doll.

605
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:20,000
-How can you say that?
-Let's go.

606
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,633
Really? But where?

607
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:27,266
If we don't hurry,
we'll never be able to see all of these.

608
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:31,900
Yeah!

609
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,233
What's wrong?

610
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:39,567
Oh, it's nothing.

611
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,900
Where to first?

612
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:47,100
I'm not so tactless
as to interfere with you two.

613
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:53,633
Wow! Those two
sure seem to be getting along well!

614
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah.

615
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,400
-I envy them.
-Yeah.

616
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:59,700
Leave them be. Let's go!

617
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,800
-OK, fine.
-OK.

618
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,133
What are you doing here?

619
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,800
Why are you here, Kitaura?

620
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:09,133
-Are you on a trip too?
-Yeah.

621
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,633
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

622
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,767
Where are you going next?

623
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:17,433
First to Ikaho shrine,
then to Kajika bridge.

624
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,900
That's exactly where I was going to go!

625
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:25,567

We've got to go here!

630
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:40,834
Right?

631
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,633

Do you want a sweet bun, Uehara?

637
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,333
-A sweet bun?
-Here.

638
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,133
Where did you get that from?

639
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,633
This lady gave it to me.

640
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
I've been keeping it warm.

641
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,567
-Thanks.
-Sure.

-The filling is coming out.
-Really?

643
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,967
Quit complaining! Here! Eat it!

644
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:17,834
-I'll eat it myself.
-No, you can't have it.

645
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,066
-Give it here.
-Give it back!

646
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,467
I'll eat it.

-Hey!
-Yum! That's good!

648
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,333
Fine! I've got another one anyway.

649
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,400
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
