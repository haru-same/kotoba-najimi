1
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,900
<i>Do you like her? Do you like Nao?</i>

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, I do. It's true.

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,400
{\an8}FIVE MINUTES LATER

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
{\an8}TEN MINUTES LATER

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,900
{\an8}FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

6
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:42,467
You're going to be late.

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,734
Sorry! Go on ahead.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,667
<i>I haven't gotten ready yet.</i>

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,100
See you.

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,667
<i>Do you like her? Do you like Nao?</i>

11
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,934
Yeah, I do.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,400
You mean... he... likes me?

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,734
It's true.

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
<i>Seriously?</i>

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No way! I can hardly believe it!

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,767
What? Really?

17
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,867
Huh? No, that's not what I mean.

18
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:38,200
I mean I never expected Uehara
to say such a thing.

19
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,900
Oh... Yeah.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
I kind of thought it was true.

21
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,300
Huh?

22
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:47,400
I thought Uehara just might like you.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Huh? Really? How did you know?

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Isn't it wonderful?

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,900
Now you can be a real boyfriend
and girlfriend.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Uh...

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,100
-To tell you the truth...
-Huh?

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,500
I haven't told him I like him.

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,500
You haven't told him you like him?

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Don't shout it!

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,467
Why not? Huh?

32
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:12,600
I mean, I was so elated...
I missed my chance to say it.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,667
Then from Uehara's perspective,
it's one-sided love?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,300
Wow! What an envious position you're in!

35
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:31,800
But I'm sure
my feelings are totally obvious.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,300
-No, I don't think he's noticed.
-Really?

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,300
I mean, Uehara can't read feelings at all!

38
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,200
Well, you can't either.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
Well, whatever.
It's almost Valentine's Day anyway.

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,600
It's your chance to tell him you like him.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
Valentine's Day?

42
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,400
Yep.

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,867
Nao! I'm so happy for you!

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,834
Good morning.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Stop!

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,467
<i>-I'm sorry.
-Like I said, don't apologize.</i>

48
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,000
Nao?

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,834
-What's wrong?
-You're spacing out.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
It's nothing at all.

51
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,867
I've got to study for the test.

52
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,300
{\an8}Just memorize this question!

53
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,467
I'll do my best!

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,734
<i>OK, pass them forward quickly.</i>

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
If you still can't master this stuff,

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
it'll affect you in your senior year.

57
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,100
You'll be having entrance exams
next year as well.

58
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,900
If you couldn't do a problem,
don't just leave it blank.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,834
OK, put them here
after they've been collected.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
What's with you?

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,100
Sorry. You can eat alone today.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
I need to talk with Marina.

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,967
-OK, goodbye.
-Hey!

64
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes?

65
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,700
Well, it doesn't really matter,

66
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,900
but we're going to see each other
every day when we're at home,

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
so it's pointless to avoid me.

68
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,667
I'm not really trying to avoid you.

69
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,500
Oh, really?

70
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:19,400
You're so stupid.
Why are you avoiding him?

71
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,200
-Well...
-Well what?

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,300
I just feel kind of self-conscious.

73
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey! Why are you laughing?

74
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,000
What about you?

75
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
When Mitsuishi said he liked you,
you avoided him!

76
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,000
-Well, it was--
-It was what?

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,967
Uh... well...

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,700
-I guess I felt self-conscious.
-See!

79
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
OK, but forget about me.

80
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,767
You've got to make plans to do something
together on Valentine's Day.

81
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,000
OK.

82
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,867
Sometimes, for a change of pace,

83
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,967
you need to go out on a date, right?

84
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,700
You know,
arrange to meet somewhere.

85
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,300
-A date?
-Yeah.

86
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,500
{\an8}Nao and Uehara

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
Done!

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,567
Uehara!

89
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,934
Sorry. Were you waiting long?

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,100
No. I just got here.

91
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,200
Shall we go?

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
OK.

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,500
Uehara... I like you.

94
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,400
I like you too.

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,300
-I'm so hungry.
-Do you like me?

96
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,767
-What's with you, Nao?
-Yes, very much! Smooch!

97
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,900
Nao! Nao! Nao!

98
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,867
Oh, Mitsuishi. Ah!
Can I stay at your place on the 13th?

99
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:22,100
Sure thing.
He'd find out if you baked at home.

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,700
-Let's make chocolate together.
-OK!

101
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,867
Then on the 14th we'll meet somewhere.

102
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,000
-Perfect!
-What are you guys talking about?

103
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,500
-It's a secret.
-What kind of chocolate should I make?

104
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,000
Uehara is the type that prefers volume
over quality.

105
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,600
A cake is probably better.

106
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,934
-Uehara loves cake!
-Great! Then let's make a cake!

107
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,500
-I get something too?
-Which cake?

108
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Uhm...

109
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,567
Uehara.

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,700
Uhm, Uehara.

111
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Hey, Uehara!

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,367
What? I can hear you.

113
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:29,400
If you can hear me, then answer!

114
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Since you've been avoiding me

115
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,367
I thought you weren't talking to me.

116
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,600
Jeez, you're mean.

117
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,700
So, what is it?

118
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:45,600
Are you studying for the tests?

119
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,900
No, not especially.

120
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,200
How can he get such good grades
when he doesn't even study?

121
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,100
Was that all you wanted?

122
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,200
Uh, no.

123
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,900
-So, Uehara.
-Yeah?

124
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,100
Uhm...

125
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,200
On Sunday the 14th--

126
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
I've got work.

127
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,800
Oh, obviously.

128
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,200
It from the evening.

129
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,900
Do you have plans in the day?

130
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:24,400
Not especially.

131
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,700
Then how about a date...

132
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:39,000
day out together.
How about a day out together?

133
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,000
Where?

134
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,867
We can decide that now.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Why?

136
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
You don't know why?

137
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,000
It's the 14th.

138
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,934
The 14th?

139
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Yeah... the 14th.

140
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
It's Valentine's Day.

141
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,500
Oh! Hey, didn't you know?

142
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:16,100
The Japanese are the only people
who get all excited over Valentine's Day.

143
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,934
Every year they get all crazy like idiots.

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,500
Really?

145
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,767
It's pretty stupid.

146
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,900
You may call it stupid,

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,700
but I bet you get tons of chocolates
at school every year.

148
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:35,700
How many do you get? Ten? 50?

149
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,600
Don't tell me it's 100!

150
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,300
Zero!

151
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,900
If I carelessly accepted any,
they'd expect something in return.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,734
It'd be a hassle, so I don't accept any.

153
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:49,934
Oh, I wouldn't want anything
in return at all.

154
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,400
Milk pudding would be enough.

155
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,400
See, you do want something.

156
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,700
Well... yeah, kind of.

157
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,934
-So, where were we?
-Huh?

158
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,500
Aren't we going somewhere?

159
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,000
You mean it's OK?

160
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,300
Yeah.

161
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
-So that's a promise?
-Yeah.

162
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,934
Really... Zero, huh?

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,400
The top three must spend a very lonely
Valentine's Day.

164
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,667
Oh, yeah. Come to think of it,
I did accept one.

165
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,400
-Really?
-From Yuri.

166
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,100
I should have known...
he'd accept one from Yuri.

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Focus! Focus!

168
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,500
-Oh, Daichi!
-<i>Huh?</i>

169
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,467
Oh, good morning.

170
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,767
Good morning.

171
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,400
Do you have morning practice today?

172
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
No. Just my own private work-out.
I'll probably do it until graduation.

173
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
That's hard. Don't you think so, Nao?

174
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,100
Yeah.

175
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,767
But as a senior,
I can finally excuse myself from Sundays.

176
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,200
Oh, I see.

177
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,967
All the seniors have been accepted
at schools,

178
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,300
so there's a farewell game Sunday.

179
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Oh, wow! That sounds like fun!

180
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,967
This is going to be our last game here,
so everyone's inviting their friends.

181
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,500
They want to make it like a festival.

182
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
If you guys are free, why don't you come?

183
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,600
Sunday...

184
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,967
-Sunday's kind of...
-Huh?

185
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,867
You know, it's Valentine's Day.

186
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,500
Oh, that's right.

187
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
Us guys decided in our excitement.
We forgot it's Valentine's.

188
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,000
Sorry.

189
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,767
Don't worry about it at all.

190
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
But we'll have a big party
for your graduation. Right, Nao?

191
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,300
-Uh-huh.
-I'm looking forward to it.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
See you.

193
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,900
Come on, you! What's with that look?

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,200
-I can't help it.
-Yes you can!

195
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,100
Why can't you just act normal?

196
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
I know I should, but...

197
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
You don't have to worry about him

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,934
because he gets lots of attention
from everyone else.

199
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,100
You just know he's going to be popular
in university.

200
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,400
Makes me a little jealous.

201
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,867
Hey, hold on.

202
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,500
Nah, never mind.

203
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:03,900
I told her.

204
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,467
I told Nao clearly.

205
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,000
OK, pass them up from the back.

206
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,567
It's over!

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,934
Yes! They're all over!

208
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,600
Nao! Let's make chocolates!

209
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,400
-Chocolates!
-Chocolates!

210
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,400
Chocolates!

211
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:38,400
CUTE CHOCOLATE CONFECTIONS

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,300
BUTTER, MILK, FLOUR,
WHIPPING CREAM, CHOCHOLATE

213
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
It's done!

214
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,800
-Take it out! Take it out!
-It looks yummy!

215
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,367
-Be careful!
-Uh-huh.

216
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,300
There we go.

217
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
It's so cute!

218
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,100
Ta-da!

219
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,367
Hmm, next one.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,667
Ta-da!

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,934
Next.

222
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,000
Maybe... No, next one.

223
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,800
Next, next.

224
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,967
Nope.

225
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,767
Darn it all!

226
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,734
Ta-da!

227
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,400
-Uh, Nao.
-Yes?

228
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,066
-Has your taste changed?
-Huh?

229
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,967
It's like, more mature, or something.

230
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,200
Well, that's because...

231
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,100
Don't tell me that...
you're letting Yuri influence you.

232
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,900
I can't believe you!

233
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,700
I mean,
Uehara already told you he liked you!

234
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,567
I know!

235
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,500
-But--
-But what?

236
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Does it bother you?

237
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,500
Last year at school
he didn't accept any chocolates at all.

238
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,300
But he did accept one from Yuri.

239
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,066
Of course he'd accept it.
They're chocolates from someone he likes.

240
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, I mean,

241
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,367
<i>He liked!</i> Past tense, right?

242
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,600
Yeah.

243
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,600
I don't think you need to act
like an adult and dress all mature

244
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,400
when it doesn't suit you.

245
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:09,734
Uehara likes you the way you are now, Nao.

246
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,467
Isn't that right?

247
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,500
Uh-huh.

248
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Even if you do act like an adult,
you'll never be Yuri.

249
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:26,000
Wait, I don't mean that in a bad way.

250
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,834
Wait! Hold on!

251
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Why don't you try this on?

252
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
-Huh?
-Yep.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,467
This might be nice.

254
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,200
-Uh, Nao.
-Huh?

255
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,734
Have you put on a little weight?

256
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Wait! Nao! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

257
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
THE NEXT DAY

258
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,867
Aren't you going to eat?

259
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,867
No, go ahead. Have it.

260
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
You're weird.

261
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:04,500
Oh, yeah. Uehara, about Sunday,

262
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
let's meet at 9:00 a.m.
at the Red Brick Warehouse.

263
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,800
Then at 10:00 a.m. we'll ride
the Ferris wheel at Cosmo World...

264
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:12,100
-Hold on a second here.
-Huh?

265
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,100
What's that all about?

266
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
Our date schedule for Sunday.

267
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,934
-What?
-What?

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You don't like Ferris wheels?

269
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:27,567
-No, the part before that is weird.
-Huh?

270
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:31,567
Why do we have to meet somewhere
when we live together?

271
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,834
But meeting somewhere is part of a date.

272
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,367
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be staying over at Marina's tomorrow.

273
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,467
Just so we can meet?

274
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:47,200
Uh, well,
I've got other things to prepare too.

275
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,400
So...

276
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:55,967
Which do you like better,
chocolates or cakes?

277
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,934
-That question makes things obvious.
-Who cares. Which one?

278
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,867
The one that fills me up.

279
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,300
Got it. Cake, huh?

280
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,500
Speaking of which...

281
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
what did you get from Yuri last year?

282
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,200
Some cake from somewhere.

283
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
What does that mean?

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,100
She's also the kind
that prefers volume over quality.

285
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,700
Yeah, you're right.

286
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,100
-Yo!
-Oh, Daichi.

287
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,900
-The tests are over, right?
-Yeah, finally.

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,367
That's good.

289
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,800
So, did she do all right?

290
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,100
-You mean Nao?
-Yeah.

291
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,900
You haven't talked to her?

292
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Well, stuff's happened.

293
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,000
When I say stuff, I mean...

294
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,700
she turned me down.

295
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:12,867
Really?

296
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,700
Lately Nao never smiles
when she's with me.

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,867
Well, yeah... I can see that.

298
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,767
-I'm sorry.
-Like I said, don't apologize.

299
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:29,500
I never wanted
to make her look like that.

300
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,000
Huh?

301
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,600
Oh, it's nothing.

302
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,934
You mean you're giving up on her?

303
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,500
Your meal's ready.

304
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,734
Go ahead and eat, Nao.

305
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,200
Sorry, Issei.

306
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Today I don't need it.

307
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
What?
Is something wrong with your stomach?

308
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
No, it's not that.

309
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm just not hungry.

310
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,400
Don't tell me you're dieting.

311
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,300
You're dieting again?

312
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,834
I've gotten a little chubby lately.

313
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,800
Did your boyfriend tell you that?

314
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,967
He's not my boyfriend!

315
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,100
Lately I've been making
a lot of chocolate cakes.

316
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
I ate too much of them.

317
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,700
Is it for Valentine's Day?

318
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,900
-Uh-huh.
-Yes! You're giving one to me too, right?

319
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
-I'll take it even if you don't mean it.
-Sorry, Abe.

320
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,800
This year I'm only giving one
to the person I'm serious about.

321
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,700
I thought finally this year
I'd end up with at least one.

322
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
You mean you're not giving me one either?

323
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,600
-No, I'm not. Sorry.
-Wow, that was awfully direct.

324
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,767
In any case,

325
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:55,800
I don't care whether it's Valentine's Day
or bikini season,

326
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,300
you have to eat. It's store policy.

327
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:03,800
I like a woman that's a little chubby
and enjoys eating.

328
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,567
Besides, how can you expect to work
on an empty stomach?

329
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,100
What if you broke another bowl?

330
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,300
So you're worried about the bowls.

331
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,400
Just eat already!

332
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,100
Fine.

333
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,100
Take care.

334
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,100
See you later.

335
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,200
You've forgotten to change.

336
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,100
No, I didn't.

337
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,934
The ramen was so good that I ate too much,

338
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,100
so I thought I'd jog all the way home.

339
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,900
Uehara didn't say a word. I'm serious.

340
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,834
I just thought
I'd like to lose some weight, that's all.

341
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,500
Hey, hold on a second.

342
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,500
-Huh?
-Just wait here.

343
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,800
-OK, let's jog!
-What?

344
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,700
I'm going to the convenience store,
so I'll jog with you until there.

345
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
OK. Ready, go!

346
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,867
-What?
-Hurry up!

347
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:02,700
Hey! Hey, wait up!

348
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,300
<i>Yes?</i>

349
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,300
-Good evening!
-Oh, Yuri!

350
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:13,400
-What's up?
-Uh, I just...

351
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,834
Oh, I brought a really delicious cake.

352
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,100
-Can I come in?
-Yes, of course.

353
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
-Thank you.
-Go ahead.

354
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,934
Hey there!

355
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:26,767
Why are you here?

356
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,200
Why are you looking so worried?
Nothing's wrong.

357
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,100
I just came over to give this to Nao.

358
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,734
-Huh? What is it?
-Open it and have a look.

359
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,600
Really?

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's so cute!

361
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,100
It's a present for you, Nao.

362
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,367
What? Really?

363
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,200
Uh-huh. I wanted to say thank you.

364
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,667
I caused you so much trouble.

365
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,600
Yuri... Thank you.

367
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,300
What?

368
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,800
-You caused me tons of trouble too.
-Oh, yeah. This dress,

369
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,700
-it also came in blue.
-It's OK. I like this color.

370
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:21,100
I thought so.
I was sure you'd like this one more.

371
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,767
I'm so happy.

372
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,700
Oh, sorry. What were you saying?

373
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,100
How's my brother? Busy, as usual?

374
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,500
Yeah, so it seems.

375
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,967
You're looking awfully pale.

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Are you all right, Yuri?

377
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,600
I had too much to drink
at an office get-together yesterday.

378
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,900
-I'm all right.
-Haven't you heard?

379
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,100
Even if it's over drinks,

380
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
strong language can affect
your performance review.

381
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,300
You're kidding!

382
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,367
I've been meaning to tell you this
for a while.

383
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,834
What?

384
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:07,867
You're the type that causes trouble
when you drink.

385
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,100
You're just fine, Yuri. Just fine.

386
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
Oh, Nao.

387
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,767
Oh, I think I'll try this on.

388
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:23,467
-Yeah, I want to see it.
-OK.

389
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:42,967
<i>Something's happened, hasn't it?</i>

390
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,967
I told you, nothing's wrong.

391
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:50,100
Then don't come over suddenly like this.

392
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,700
Oh, were you worried about me?

393
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,734
Of course I'd worry.

394
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,700
<i>You're my sister-in-law after all,
for some strange reason.</i>

395
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,100
"For some strange reason"?

396
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Jeez,
you're always so emotionally unsteady.

397
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,934
How dare you say that!

398
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,000
<i>How dare I say it?
Then don't come over if it's not true.</i>

399
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,200
<i>Why not? I can if I like.</i>

400
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,934
<i>-Here. It's a cake.
-I don't want it.</i>

401
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,000
<i>OK, fine!</i>

402
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:32,800
Oh, here it is.
That something cake from somewhere.

403
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:38,100
Yuri seemed like she'd lost weight.

404
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,567
Really?

405
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
You know you noticed.

406
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Huh? Did you say something?

407
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,400
No, nothing.

408
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,400
Uh-oh.

409
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,100
Aw, jeez.

410
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,367
I'll be back in a minute.

411
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,200
Yuri!

412
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
You forgot these.

413
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,900
Sorry.

414
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,500
{\an8}KONNO

415
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,467
Nao.

416
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,300
Huh?

417
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:15,400
Oh, dear!

418
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,300
-It's OK. It's OK.
-I'm sorry.

419
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,934
Oh, actually,

420
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,967
could you taste this?

421
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,867
-It's good.
-Really?

422
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,400
I'll try it.

423
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,900
Yeah, you're right!

424
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Huh? What?

425
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,600
You've got some on you.

426
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,567
-Where? Get it off.
-Your chin.

427
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,000
That's really cute.

428
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,300
Yuri gave it to me.

429
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Yuri sure is nice.

430
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,200
Nao?

431
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,200
She sure is.

432
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:04,500
She's absolutely perfect.

433
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,600
It feels like I'm becoming
more and more selfish.

434
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,834
What do you mean?

435
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:22,000
Before, I thought
that I didn't mind that he liked Yuri.

436
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,000
But since Uehara said he likes me,

437
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:32,000
the stuff I thought couldn't be helped...

438
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,834
You won't tolerate anymore?

439
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,734
No, it's not that I won't tolerate it,
but...

440
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,300
I'm not sure how to put it.

441
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,300
You mean,
"Don't be nice to any woman besides me."

442
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,300
No, it's not that bad.

443
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,500
That's exactly the kind of thing
you <i>should</i> say.

444
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,800
Nobody likes that kind of thing,

445
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,567
when the guy you like is kind
to another woman.

446
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:06,500
Is that what this is?

447
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,367
Yes, that's what this is.

448
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,000
But, Uehara <i>did</i> say that he likes you,
right?

449
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:20,700
Uh-huh.

450
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,200
He told it to Yuri too, right?

451
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,867
Well, then in that case--

452
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:27,834
I know, but...

453
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,200
But I've been around him so much.

454
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,300
I know that Yuri's special to him.

455
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,100
That's it! No more talk of this!

456
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,900
Yeah, you're right.

457
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:55,100
Besides, I'm going to spend all day
with Uehara tomorrow.

458
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,300
That's right.

459
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,300
You've got to tell him your feelings
tomorrow too.

460
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,867
Now I'm getting all nervous.

461
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,600
Jeez, Nao! Pull yourself together.

462
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,000
-I'm worried.
-Stop it!

463
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,200
The cake is perfect.

464
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,100
All you have to do is say, "I like you"
and give it to him.

465
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:21,834
I'm sure Uehara will be pleased.

466
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
OK.

467
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,800
You can do it, Nao!

468
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,467
I will.

469
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,834
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for coming.

470
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,900
You can go now, Uehara.

471
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,500
OK.

472
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,500
-Uehara!
-Yeah?

473
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,100
Here, this is for you.

474
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,800
Oh, I don't accept any chocolate.

475
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,600
I know that.

476
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,700
Then why'd you make it?

477
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,300
-You made me taste tons of them.
-Because I made up my mind.

478
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,000
Once I gave this to Uehara,
I'd forget about him,

479
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,500
and get serious about entrance exams.

480
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,900
Then I'll get into the same high school
as Uehara.

481
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,400
That's still not forgetting about him.

482
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,667
You'll still be thinking about him
the whole time.

483
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,600
Thanks.

484
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,100
Do your best on those exams.

485
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,767
What's wrong with you?
Why are you crying, Dad?

486
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,900
It makes me so sad
to see my own daughter heartbroken.

487
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,500
I'm not heartbroken.
I'm just giving up for a while.

488
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,700
Oh, come on, Dad!

489
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
-He rejected you.
-No he didn't!

490
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,800
-Your first rejection.
-He didn't reject me!

491
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:37,800
<i>-Come on, let's have a drink.
-Yeah, just one more.</i>

492
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,400
<i>Well, let me think. I'm quite a handful
when I'm drunk, you know.</i>

493
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,200
<i>-You won't be able to handle me.
-Really?</i>

494
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,200
Yuri?

495
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,700
I kiss everyone I see.

496
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,667
-Cool! That's perfect!
-Come on, let's go!

497
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,900
-It feels like this was meant to be.
-Over here!

498
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm sorry for the trouble she's caused.

499
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,100
-Uehara?
-Let's go.

500
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,100
Hey! Hold it right there!
Who the hell are you?

501
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,300
Oh! Sorry! Sorry!
This is my little brother.

502
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,400
-Little brother?
-He's always meddling in my business.

503
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,867
Bye, Uehara.
OK, let's go for another drink.

504
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,000
What the fuck's your problem?

505
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,400
Quit trying to push me around!

506
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:20,800
Uh-oh!

507
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,600
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

508
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:33,667
I'll take you home.

509
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,000
No, I'm not going back home.

510
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,467
What's happened this time?

511
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,734
Takuya's away on business.

512
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Let me stay there tonight.

513
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,467
Jeez! Quit it with that look!

514
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,367
OK, fine! Then I'm going to go drinking.

515
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,767
Hey you guys! Hold on there!

516
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,600
Let's go.

517
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,900
-Get in.
-I'm here, Nao!

518
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
-She's not here.
-What?

519
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,100
She's staying over at a friend's house.

520
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,400
-Then I'm going home.
-Hey!

521
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,000
-It's too late to be going anywhere.
-Let go of me!

522
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,400
You OK?

523
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,300
God damn you.

524
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
-What was that for?
-You liar.

525
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,000
I hate you.

526
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:23,900
I wonder if he's asleep.

527
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, shit!

528
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,600
Sorry. I'm going home. Yuri.

529
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,000
-<i>Hello?</i>
-I'm sorry, Nao.

530
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,867
<i>Wait for me. I'll be there in a bit.</i>

531
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
You overslept?

532
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, sorry.

533
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,700
It's OK. I'll be waiting.

534
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
Yuri.

535
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,100
Takuya's going to be transferred
overseas it seems.

536
00:37:58,834 --> 00:37:59,934
Really?

537
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I saw some documents
he'd hidden in the car.

538
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,300
{\an8}TOUKEN HOME - SYDNEY OFFICE

539
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,500
{\an8}What's this?

540
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:21,800
OVERSEAS POSTING OF A SINGLE PERSON

541
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
APPLICATION FOR SINGLE PERSON HOUSING

542
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,967
He'll be going to Australia.

543
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,200
It looks like he plans to go alone.

544
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,100
But why?

545
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,400
You brothers are both alike.

546
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You can do everything alone.

547
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,600
He's probably fine without me.

548
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:54,300
He was probably consulting
with his ex-girlfriend this whole time.

549
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,100
They might even... be going together.

550
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,400
What are you talking about?

551
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,934
Things he can't say to me...

552
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,200
he talks about to his ex-girlfriend.

553
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,967
But I was left in the dark.

554
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,767
This is just so stupid.

555
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:24,834
Why did he even marry me
if he was going to be this way?

556
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,066
I wish I'd never married him.

557
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
You've got a fever.

558
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,200
Forget about me.

559
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,867
Hello? Where are you now?

560
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:09,367
-<i>I'm sorry, Nao.</i>
-What?

561
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,767
<i>I can't go.</i>

562
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:16,300
-Huh?
-<i>Go ahead and go home.</i>

563
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,200
Did something happen?

564
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:35,200
Does it have to do with Yuri?

565
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,300
<i>I'm sorry, Nao.</i>

566
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,700
I'll be home soon. Just wait a--

567
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,000
<i>No!</i>

568
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,200
Huh?

569
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,200
<i>I knew it.
You still prefer Yuri, don't you?</i>

570
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:52,800
Nao?

571
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,200
Come on. Let's go.

572
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:50,800
You said it though...
that you'd gotten over her.

573
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,467
You told me...

574
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,600
that you like me.

575
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,900
<i>We'll do this next week instead, OK?</i>

576
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,800
Yeah, if it's sunny.

577
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,200
-See you later!
-Bye.

578
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,367
Take care.

579
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,667
Nao.

580
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,467
What happened to you? You're soaking wet!

581
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,100
What about you, Daichi?
Don't you have a game?

582
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,000
No, it's raining.

583
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,867
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right.

584
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,500
Nao?

585
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,934
Daichi, you're a rain man, aren't you?

586
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,767
No, it's you, Nao. You're the rain woman.

587
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,367
Oh, yeah. That's right.

588
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,400
Weren't you supposed to meet that guy
somewhere?

589
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:45,700
Yeah... we were.

590
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,834
Oh, that must be why.

591
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,667
That must be why it's raining.

592
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,400
Sorry, Daichi.

593
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,867
I'm sorry.

594
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,834
I'm sorry, I...

595
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:24,800
I'm sorry.

596
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,300
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
