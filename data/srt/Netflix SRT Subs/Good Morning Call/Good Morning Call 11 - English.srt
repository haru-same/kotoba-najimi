1
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,734
Dad! Mom!

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,233
-Welcome home, Nao.
-You're looking healthy.

3
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,767
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,367
{\an8}We were invited to a wedding.

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,800
{\an8}And we wanted to see you, Nao.

6
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,533
{\an8}Are you eating well?

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,233
{\an8}You look like you've lost a little weight.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,767
{\an8}No, I'm perfectly fine.

9
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,567
{\an8}If you're going to come,
then you've got to tell me.

10
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,934
Your father wanted to surprise you.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,834
I don't need that kind of surprise.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,233
Why not?

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,133
Do you have a secret we'll find out
if we drop in suddenly?

14
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:52,266
Oh, no...
Of course there's nothing like that.

15
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,600
Who is that?

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,900
Uhm... He's from school...

17
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,033
You mean he's...

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,233
-Your homeroom teacher?
-Huh?

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,133
Oh, please.
That's obviously a school uniform.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,467
Oh, dear me! I was just kidding.
He looks so adult-like.

21
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:19,467
Uhm... This is Uehara Hisashi.
He goes to the same school.

22
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,900
He just happens to live
in the same building. Right?

23
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:26,934
Oh, yes. Hello. Nice to meet you.
I'm Uehara.

24
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:34,600
Wow, this is a really nice place,
isn't it?

25
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,000
So this is your room.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,166
Oh, you know, the place is a real mess.

27
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,667
So, could you come back later?

28
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:47,300
Oh, that's right!
Uehara works at a cafe near the station.

29
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:48,567
Why don't we all go there?

30
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,200
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,900
I knew it'd be a mess,
so I brought my apron.

32
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:55,633
I'll clean the place up quickly
so we've got a place to sleep.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,967
-Yep.
-What?

34
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,667
You mean you're staying the night here?

35
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,100
Of course we are.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,600
No! No! Impossible! No way!

37
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,800
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,333
What's wrong with us staying
at our daughter's place?

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,433
There's nothing wrong with it,
but the place is so small.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,667
Huh?
I thought you said it was quite large.

41
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,900
Oh! I don't have any comforters for you!

42
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,567
No problem.

43
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:23,834
I rented comforters
so they'd arrive today.

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,533
It's so convenient nowadays.
It's just a simple click on the Internet.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,900
Wait! Wait! Hold on a minute!

46
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,934
I've got to clean the place up!

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,266
<i>Nao, we don't care if it's a mess.</i>

48
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,266
I said wait a minute! I <i>do</i> care!

49
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,533
KING RAMEN

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,133
MEN'S

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,600
Can't have this here.

52
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,367
That's no good.

53
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,767
Such a beautiful place!

54
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,934
This is pretty big!

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,166
You've got to be kidding
if you think this is small!

56
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,834
-Come on in, Uehara.
-Oh, thank you.

57
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,300
There are no mountains to look at,
so I don't feel quite at home.

58
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,500
We've forgotten
what it's like living in the city.

59
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,467
You're right.

60
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,066
{\an8}RULES

61
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,166
Hey, Nao!

62
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,600
There must be something wrong
with this place if it's only $800.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,133
That's what I thought at first too.

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,066
But they had reasons for it being $800.

65
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,300
Reasons?

66
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,233
Uh, well...

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,066
The landlady is a really nice person.

68
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh, I'd love to meet her.

69
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,467
Well, maybe next time.

70
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,767
Is that your room, Nao?

71
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:26,667
-Huh?
-Oh!

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,300
Oh, my!

73
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:34,200
Look! You're keeping it so clean!

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,600
You think so?

75
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,233
And you're studying properly too, I see.

76
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Well, yeah.

77
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,934
What's this over here?

78
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,400
Ah! Wait!

79
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,467
This is U...

80
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,333
Huh? Uu?

81
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,100
-Uu...
-Uu?

82
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,700
Walk-in-closet!

83
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,500
My! There sure is a lot of storage space.

84
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,233
The closet walks?

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,567
It's just where I keep extra stuff.

86
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,633
It's a big mess, so don't you dare go in.

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,533
-OK, OK.
-I can at least have a look?

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,667
Dad! This is my own place, OK?

89
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,900
OK, fine.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,834
What's wrong?

91
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,967
Uh, uhm... This is mental training.

92
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,734
-Ah!
-Huh? What?

93
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,133
What's the matter?

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,567
-I got a little light-headed.
-Really? Are you OK?

95
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,834
-Paper! Here!
-Paper hair?

96
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,066
On the floor!

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,667
Are you all right?

98
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,967
Oh, I'm fine. It was nothing.

99
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,500
That's good to hear.

100
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,967
You're awfully young
to be getting light-headed.

101
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,266
You're absolutely right.

102
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,667
"Men's"?

103
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,967
What's this, Nao?

104
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,700
I... uh...

105
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:58,567
Oh, yeah. That dumb friend
of yours is into that, right?

106
00:05:58,867 --> 00:05:59,767
Dumb friend?

107
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,100
Uhm, I mean...

108
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,767
Nao's good friend...

109
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,066
I've got to use your restroom!

110
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,033
Ah! This is the bath!

111
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,066
My place has the same layout.
The toilet is over there.

112
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,133
Ah! Hurry! Hurry!

113
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,533
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Here you go.

115
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:57,800
-Here you are, Uehara.
-Thank you.

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,967
If I'd known
there was such a handsome guy here,

117
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,533
I would have brought a souvenir.

118
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,367
Well, instead of a souvenir,

119
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:12,667
I <i>do</i> have my special croquettes.

120
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,900
I told her not to bring them
because they're just extra weight.

121
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,467
She wanted you to have them so badly,
she got up at three o'clock.

122
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,900
But I guess I could have made them here.

123
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,800
I didn't know if I'd have time
or the utensils to do it.

124
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,600
They look delicious, don't they?

125
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,834
After eating these,
I decided to marry her.

126
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,333
-Really?
-Not that story again.

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,934
Dad always tells this story
when Mom makes croquettes.

128
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,200
I made a lot of other
more difficult dishes, didn't I?

129
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:42,433
But it was the croquettes
that won over my stomach.

130
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,367
You can't get croquettes better
than this anywhere.

131
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:48,734
And they're even better
since they're made with potatoes we grew.

132
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,500
Here, have one.

133
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,834
No, I can't, really.

134
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,967
Please, help yourself. I can make more.

135
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:58,500
It appears she's cooking for herself,
so I've got all the things I need here.

136
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:02,066
Mom,
you've got to teach me how to make these.

137
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,800
Oh! Have you gotten a boyfriend?

138
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:10,300
There's no way that's possible,
right, Nao?

139
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,266
Uh... yeah.

140
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,900
I just can't recreate the taste of these.

141
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,500
Of course not.
You see, it's my trade secret!

142
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,467
Really?

143
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,467
Uehara, are you one of Nao's schoolmates?

144
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,667
Schoolmates?

145
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,567
We have different homerooms.

146
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,066
Do you live here with your family?

147
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,233
No, I live away from my family.

148
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,767
Uehara lives alone too.

149
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,800
Oh, I see.

150
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,800
Do you often...

151
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,200
come here to visit?

152
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,367
This is my first time.

153
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,166
Oh, I see.

154
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:05,066
Uehara is so busy with work
that he hardly ever comes home.

155
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,567
He leaves early in the morning
and comes home late

156
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,066
so he goes straight to bed
when he gets home, right?

157
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,734
You sure know him well.

158
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,834
Uh... well...

159
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,700
We sometimes come home from work
at the same time.

160
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,433
That reminds me,

161
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,066
you're working at a ramen shop,
aren't you, Nao?

162
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,967
I'd really like to see you at work there.

163
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,367
Uh, sorry, it's nothing.

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,700
The ramen is so good
that it makes you laugh, isn't it?

165
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:43,066
With having to work morning and night,

166
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,300
are your grades all right?

167
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,600
-Uehara's at the top of the class.
-Really?

168
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,734
Wow! That's amazing!

169
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,133
Nao, you should have Uehara be your tutor.

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
-What?
-Ow! That's hot!

171
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,867
-Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
-What are you talking about?

172
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,600
-Are you OK, Dad?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,834
Uhm, I've got to get to work pretty soon.

174
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Oh, yeah. That's right.

175
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,667
Hold on a minute.

176
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,633
You said that this was the first time
you've been here.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,834
Huh?

178
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,967
How did you know this had tissues in it?

179
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,900
This looks like nothing more
than a stuffed animal!

180
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:43,734
Actually, he does sometimes
come help me study

181
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,467
and has dinner here.

182
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,834
I'm very sorry.

183
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
-What?
-Huh?

184
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,934
What are you doing, Uehara?

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,533
Nao and I are dating.

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, really? You should have told us, Nao.

187
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,200
But we only started just recently.

188
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,033
That was a surprise.

189
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,967
<i>I'm</i> the one who's surprised.

190
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:21,266
What's wrong with you?
Why didn't you say so?

191
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,533
-I'm sorry.
-There's no need to apologize.

192
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,066
I'm so happy that Nao's got a boyfriend.

193
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,100
OK, Uehara. Time to go to work, right?

194
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,100
Uhm, but I've still got things to say.

195
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,633
Her father's a bit flustered right now.
Let's go.

196
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,367
I've got to pull myself together.

197
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,934
Wait right there!

198
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:10,934
I want an explanation.

199
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,734
I'm very sorry.

200
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:23,700
We were the victims
of a double-contract scam

201
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:27,900
and just happened to move in here
on the exact same day.

202
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,333
A scam!

203
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,133
Why didn't you tell us about
such an important thing?

204
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,100
I didn't want to cause you
any extra worry.

205
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,767
-Extra worry?
-No matter the reason,

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,767
you kept it secret from your parents,
that you're living with another student.

207
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,166
I will never allow it.

208
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm taking Nao back home with us.

209
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,300
We'll worry about the rest later.

210
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:54,667
Dad!

211
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:58,300
This is exactly why I was opposed
to you living alone in the first place!

212
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,200
But, it's a little late now--

213
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:02,934
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't approved of it.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,266
What? Are you saying this is my fault?

215
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,033
You're the one who said
that she'd have problems in the future

216
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,600
if she didn't learn how to cook and clean.

217
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,066
So you said she should
experience living on her own!

218
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,233
I said living <i>alone</i> was OK,
not living <i>with a guy</i>!

219
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,066
Then why are you getting angry at me?

220
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,266
Because you've always spoiled Nao.

221
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,233
You're the last person
I want to hear that from.

222
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,166
Why?

223
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:30,233
You're the one who always spoiled Nao!

224
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,500
You'd give her spending money
without telling me

225
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,500
and let her eat as much candy
as she wanted.

226
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,934
Thanks to that,
Nao's always had tons of cavities.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,266
-Why are we talking about this?
-Cut it out!

228
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,767
I will leave.

229
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,000
Huh? Uehara?

230
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,433
I'll go back to my home
for the time being.

231
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,533
I apologize for all of this.

232
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,100
I want an explanation.

233
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,600
I already told you.

234
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,100
Don't talk to me like that.

235
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,734
But you won't believe me
no matter what I say, Dad!

236
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,066
What are you talking about?

237
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,100
It's exactly because I believe you
that I want to know the truth.

238
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,166
What's with you sleeping
with that scrawny guy?

239
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,667
Not sleeping together. Living together.

240
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,800
-It's the same.
-No, it's not.

241
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:45,200
I can't pay the $1,500 rent,
so it couldn't be helped.

242
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,867
Couldn't be helped?

243
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:50,100
You're being deceived by him!
Wake up to that fact, would you?

244
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,467
Uehara isn't that kind of person!

245
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:55,900
Everybody knows that handsome guys
are rotten at the core.

246
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,800
What are you talking about?
You're just jealous!

247
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,967
Jeal... What are you talking about?

248
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,734
I may not be now,
but I used to be pretty darn good looking!

249
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,667
Who cares about that?

250
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:06,800
You're changing the subject!

251
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:09,800
At any rate, I will not allow it, ever!

252
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,767
But if you insist on continuing
to live here...

253
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,400
then I'll sever our ties with you!

254
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,767
Dear!

255
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,734
If you still want to live with him
after that, then do what you like!

256
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,000
I hate you, Dad!

257
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:39,000
CAFE

258
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,633
Uehara!

259
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,266
Oh no! What're you doing?

260
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,200
I was rejected again.

261
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,100
<i>Holy crap!</i>

262
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,700
That's worse than me getting rejected.

263
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,533
A million times worse.

264
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,967
That's rough!
It would be bad enough

265
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:07,166
meeting your girlfriend's parents
under normal circumstances.

266
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,200
So, that's what it's like?

267
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:13,467
-Well, I've never had that chance.
-I didn't think so.

268
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,800
But my own mom,

269
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,467
she'd be totally happy
if I got a girlfriend.

270
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:25,367
-Oh, sorry.
-About what?

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,133
But seriously, though,
what are you going to do?

272
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,767
There's a room open on the second floor
at one of my jobs.

273
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:39,166
So at least I've got a place to move to.

274
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,633
Are you sure that's OK?

275
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,533
Well, Nao was in quite a panic.

276
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:51,567
-I mean, are <i>you</i> going to be OK?
-Huh?

277
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,867
You'll be separated from Nao.

278
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:00,967
But if Nao's free,

279
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,200
maybe I'll ask her to date me again.

280
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,667
Ow!

281
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,266
That seriously hurt, Uehara!

282
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:12,900
Hey!

283
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,033
Ow, that really hurt.

284
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,333
{\an8}YOSHIKAWA NAO

285
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,433
Wow! It finally happened.
So what did your parents say?

286
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,166
My dad was totally pissed off.
He said he's taking me back home.

287
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,700
I see.

288
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:54,900
Wait! That means you'll transfer out!
No! Please don't do that!

289
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,867
I don't want that either!

290
00:17:56,934 --> 00:18:00,100
But he said he'd sever relations with me
if I didn't.

291
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,934
Wow! That's brutal.

292
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,800
What about your mom?

293
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,133
It's odd. Mom's awfully cool about it.
It's actually kind of scary.

294
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,200
Yeah, I guess it makes sense.

295
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,000
No girl's parents are OK
with their daughter living with a guy.

296
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,467
I don't know what to do.

297
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,967
In any case,
one of you should probably move.

298
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,900
Though that won't settle everything.

299
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:34,934
What about Uehara? What's he doing now?

300
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:37,633
He went to his brother's
for the time being.

301
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,233
I see.

302
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:51,667
I can't see him at home
and at school on break.

303
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,033
Must be lonely.

304
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,200
And it's going to be like this
for a long time too, right?

305
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:07,767
But you and him have it good.

306
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,266
When school's on break

307
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,967
Mitsuishi and I can only meet
once every three days.

308
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,667
I guess we've had it too good until now.

309
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,633
Yep.

310
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,900
It's the landlady.

311
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,667
You'd better answer.

312
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,500
Hello?

313
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,166
<i>Nao works real hard.</i>

314
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,600
She's our shop's fresh young face.

315
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,934
Oh, you must be kidding.

316
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:53,433
At home, she always left the place a mess.

317
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,033
And even when she occasionally
helped me with cooking,

318
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,066
she'd break dishes and cut her fingers.

319
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,400
She broke a ton when she first started.

320
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,800
But lately she's down to breaking
only one a day.

321
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,066
Really?

322
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,600
I'd love to have her
as my daughter-in-law.

323
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,033
-Oh, come on, Dad!
-I'm just saying

324
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
that how good she is.

325
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,166
She really is honest,
serious and a great worker.

326
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm so glad to hear that.

327
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,367
Would you like a <i>kaedama</i>, sir?

328
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,834
What's that?

329
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,667
A refill. He'll fill your bowl
with more ramen, right?

330
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:25,567
Right.

331
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,533
OK, I'll have a <i>kaedama</i>.

332
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
-One <i>kaedama</i>!
-Coming right up!

333
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,033
Just look at that smile!

334
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,800
All Nao's friends have become
regular customers.

335
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,734
I really appreciate it.

336
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,767
-Dad!
-What?

337
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:04,567
How come you told the landlady
you're cancelling the contract?

338
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,533
This isn't just <i>my</i> home.

339
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,967
All I told her was that you're leaving.

340
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,800
If he wants to live here, then he can.

341
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:14,033
But Uehara's got special circumstances.

342
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,700
What do I care?

343
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:18,667
So you don't care what happens to Uehara?

344
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,433
It has nothing to do with our family.

345
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,533
You're awful.

346
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:25,367
Nao.

347
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:27,333
I hate your guts, Dad!

348
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,500
-Where are you going, Nao?
-I don't care. Anywhere but here.

349
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,333
There's no way
I'm going back home with Dad!

350
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,834
Nao!

351
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,200
Dear!

352
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:39,266
It's none of my concern.
Let her do what she wants.

353
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,967
Dear!

354
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,567
CAFE

355
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,533
Nao!

356
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,000
Uehara.

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,467
What are you doing here?

358
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,400
-I ran away.
-What?

359
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,767
Come over here.

360
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,700
<i>What the hell are you thinking?</i>

361
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,600
<i>Dad says he's going to cancel
the rental agreement</i>

362
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,333
<i>and take me back home.</i>

363
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,800
There's no way I'll stand for that!

364
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,467
Nao.

365
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:37,266
Let me stay at your brother's place.

366
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,667
I don't want to see my dad anymore.

367
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:44,333
He's talking about severing relations
with me if we keep living together.

368
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,667
<i>I will</i> sever relations with <i>him</i>!

369
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:47,867
That stupid blockhead!

370
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,734
I'm taking you back to the apartment.

371
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:04,233
-What?
-Go back.

372
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:12,500
You mean you're all right
with me going back to my parents' place?

373
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,767
So, you won't be lonely?

374
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,166
You're OK with not seeing me anymore?

375
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:30,066
How come you won't say anything?

376
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,233
Am I the only one
who wants to stay together forever?

377
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,467
Nao.

378
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,467
I don't want you to run away from home.

379
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:45,033
I want you to go back
and apologize to your father.

380
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,367
-No.
-Nao!

381
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:54,066
Don't ever say you'll sever relations
with your parents.

382
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,300
I'll be thinking about
what to do for our future too.

383
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:20,700
OK?

384
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,800
Welcome.

385
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:05,033
-Just a party of one.
-Go ahead. Sit wherever you like.

386
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,300
-I'm home.
-Oh, hi.

387
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,133
Huh? Hey Dad, where's Uehara?

388
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, now that you mention it,
he's not here yet.

389
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,000
Aw, darn it all.

390
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh. Hello.

391
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,166
Thank you for waiting. Here you are.

392
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,667
Uhm, is that Uehara you mentioned
Uehara Hisashi?

393
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,500
Yes. Oh, are you an acquaintance?

394
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,133
Oh, uh, yes.

395
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,734
Are you a relative of his?

396
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,700
Ah... uh, yes, kind of...

397
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,967
Oh, is that so? What a surprise.

398
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,567
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kusanagi.

399
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:55,166
You know, he's a really hard worker.

400
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,633
I worry about him,

401
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,533
so sometimes I feel like
I should treat him like I were his father.

402
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,133
Like his father?

403
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,767
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was awfully presumptuous of me.

404
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,967
I didn't know he had any relatives nearby.

405
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:09,967
It's OK.

406
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,467
I'm sorry.

407
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:15,133
When I heard that his parents died
when he was little

408
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,633
and he was an orphan,

409
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,266
I wondered if there was any way
that I could help him.

410
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,400
Oh, but he does have an older brother.

411
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,266
But he's already got a family of his own,

412
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,033
and he's going to be transferred
overseas soon.

413
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,900
But it's not that easy to do what he does.

414
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:39,166
Earning money to live off of by himself...
And he's got great grades as well.

415
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,533
He's so serious and a hard worker.

416
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,467
Let's go.

417
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,200
It's from the cafe.

418
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Go ahead and go to work.

419
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,967
Don't worry. I'll go back like you said.

420
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:27,567
I'll be fine. Thank you.

421
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,800
No, I can't do this.

422
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:47,900
<i>Nao.</i>

423
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,867
Mom.

424
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,066
Welcome home, Nao.

425
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,633
I thought you'd run away from home.

426
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:16,734
Uehara told me to come back.

427
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,700
But I have no intention
of going back home with you.

428
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,033
I want to graduate from this high school.

429
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,900
And I don't want to leave my friends.

430
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,734
Dear,

431
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm against forcing Nao to come back home.

432
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,567
Mom.

433
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,567
I can't forgive you for not telling us
that you were living with him,

434
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,300
but I know that there were
unavoidable circumstances for both of you.

435
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,133
What circumstances?

436
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:56,900
Uehara lost his parents
when he was little,

437
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:01,066
and his only family is his older brother.

438
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,900
How did you find that out?

439
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,600
Why didn't you tell us that before?

440
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,767
That the both of you
started living together

441
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,066
only after worrying a lot over
whether you should.

442
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,433
I'm asking you too, dear.

443
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,900
I don't want you to do anything rash

444
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,734
like forcing her to suddenly move out
like this.

445
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:41,467
I think

446
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:45,900
we should spend a little more time
before coming to a decision about this.

447
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,867
Oh, Mom.

448
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:57,400
I want to trust you, Nao.

449
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,100
Besides, dear,

450
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,700
you're unhappy just because
Nao got herself a boyfriend, right?

451
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,033
Nao, fathers will always

452
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,000
object to whatever boys
their daughters bring home.

453
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,533
And it's even worse
the more handsome he is.

454
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,233
Jeez! You women always end up
conspiring together so easily.

455
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,066
You may have succeeded
in sweet-talking your mother into this,

456
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,834
but you won't be able to win me over
so easily.

457
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,133
But I haven't sweet-talked her at all.

458
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,133
That's right.
You always get suspicious so easily.

459
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I can't stand this.

460
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,533
Where are you going?
We'll be having dinner soon.

461
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,233
-I won't need it.
-Dad!

462
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,200
CAFE

463
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,600
-Manager.
-Uh-huh?

464
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,834
Sorry,

465
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,133
but can I finish up now today?

466
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,467
Sure. What's up?

467
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:17,166
There's someone that I have to talk to.

468
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,166
Welcome!

469
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,400
I was just on my way to go talk to you.

470
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:55,667
Did you think you could have a proper talk
on an empty stomach?

471
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,567
You're right.

472
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,266
You're very frank.

473
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,800
Sorry.

474
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:09,533
Huh?

475
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:11,600
Croquettes again?

476
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:16,033
These are the best way
to put your father in a good mood.

477
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,633
Besides, you want to learn how to make
the Yoshikawa special croquette, right?

478
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:24,433
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

479
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,567
Oh! That's hot!

480
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,400
-Oh, you! Here, use a washcloth.
-Okay.

481
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:34,033
-Those will burn you.
-Thank you.

482
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,500
I think your father can understand
the difficulties Uehara's going through.

483
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:56,467
My father was completely opposed
to me going to university.

484
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:01,567
But I wanted to go to university
in Tokyo so badly

485
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,333
so I ran away from home.

486
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,633
When I was a student, I had to earn
my tuition and everything myself.

487
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,800
Back then, that was the norm.

488
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:18,367
But now, it's different for students.

489
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,500
Oh, I'm not old enough.

490
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:26,033
Oh, that's right.
You're still in high school.

491
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:27,633
Yeah, still.

492
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,567
-Here we go!
-What?

493
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:41,633
For the Yoshikawa family
special croquettes,

494
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,667
I put in a little bit
of whipping cream here.

495
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:48,967
Wow! So that's the secret
behind their fluffiness!

496
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh, dear! I've given away
your mother's trade secret!

497
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:13,166
-Mom?
-Uh-huh?

498
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:19,467
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,133
You said

500
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,400
you didn't want to cause us
any extra worry because of the scam.

501
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:36,066
But, you see, parents want extra worry.

502
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:42,333
Think of how lonely I'd be
if you didn't cause me to worry.

503
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,834
Oh, Mom.

504
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:52,333
You want to keep living here with Uehara,
don't you, Nao?

505
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,166
Uh-huh.

506
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,800
All right.

507
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,200
But I want you to make me one promise.

508
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:12,166
Promise me
that you won't lie to me anymore.

509
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:19,100
From now on I'll listen carefully
to what you have to say

510
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,900
and worry with you,
and think things over with you.

511
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,400
So I want you to talk to me
about anything important in your life.

512
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,066
OK.

513
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:34,300
Good.

514
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:39,300
All right.
Now shape these into croquettes.

515
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,633
Oh, OK!

516
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,233
I'm sorry about what happened.

517
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,100
Did you want to see me just to apologize?

518
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:56,033
Please allow us to live together.

519
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,266
And if I say no?

520
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,066
Either way,

521
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,333
this will end when there's an opening
in the girls' dorm.

522
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,300
Then when we graduate,
things will change for both of us.

523
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,533
But...

524
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,200
even if we cannot live together

525
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:19,867
I would still like

526
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,400
to be with Nao.

527
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,066
I will take good care of her.

528
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,834
Do you understand what it means
to take good care of someone?

529
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,266
Yes.

530
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,667
I will never do anything
that would cause you to worry about her.

531
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,834
That goes without saying.

532
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:56,300
Two <i>kaedama</i>, please!

533
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,734
-Huh?
-Coming right up!

534
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:01,400
-Two <i>kaedama</i>!
-Two <i>kaedama</i>, coming right up!

535
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,467
They'll refill your bowl with noodles.

536
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:07,633
They call it <i>kaedama</i>.
Didn't you know that?

537
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:18,100
-This one is so cute! I really like it.
-The pink one is pretty.

538
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:19,333
-I like it too.
-But--

539
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:27,033
Huh? What's going on?
Uehara! Dad! Why are you together?

540
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,633
We met by chance at Evening Star Ramen.

541
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,166
Oh, honey! Just look at you!
Sorry, Uehara.

542
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:33,100
-Oh, honey!
-This is really delicious!

543
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,867
Evening Star pot stickers!

544
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:36,867
-Eat them while they're hot!
-Oh, dear!

545
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:38,600
But I made croquettes!

546
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,900
Croquettes? Then I'm having a croquette!

547
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,066
Dad, you're drunk!

548
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,300
-Nao, get out the comforter.
-Ok.

549
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,734
-Are you all right?
-I'm just fine.

550
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,600
You know, when I ate these croquettes,

551
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,266
that's what made me decide to marry her.

552
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,500
Not that old story again.

553
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,500
I'm sorry about this.

554
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:01,600
It's all right.

555
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,100
OK, I'll be going now.

556
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,767
Oh, but you live here, right, Uehara?

557
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,600
Now, I don't know
what happened between you two,

558
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,333
but I'm certain he's given his permission
to allow you to live together.

559
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,100
Really?

560
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,233
Yes, he has.

561
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,300
Only until there's an opening
in the girls' dorm.

562
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,567
Seriously?

563
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:26,767
Uh-huh.

564
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:29,734
How did you know, Mom?

565
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,934
Your father doesn't get drunk
around other people.

566
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:35,567
When I saw that, I knew right away.

567
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,967
He'd made a decision

568
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,567
that he couldn't handle
unless he was drunk.

569
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,333
Uehara,

570
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:52,934
please take good care of Nao.

571
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,934
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,400
<i>Can I come in?</i>

573
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:25,100
Uehara, can I borrow
one of your alarm clocks?

574
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,233
Are you all right?

575
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,900
I'm so tired.

576
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,934
I think my life's been shortened
by three years.

577
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,500
Yeah, that was rough.

578
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,834
I bet you <i>are</i> tired.

579
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,133
It's only natural.

580
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,533
But I'm happy.

581
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:00,100
About what?

582
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,600
That I was able to talk with your parents.

583
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:11,667
And your dad treated me to ramen.

584
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:17,400
It all makes me happy.

585
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,200
Welcome back home...

586
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:48,667
Uehara.

587
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,867
<i>I can't believe I got smashed so easily.</i>

588
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:01,767
<i>I must be getting old.</i>

589
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,567
<i>It only makes sense that Nao's matured.</i>

590
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:10,166
She couldn't do anything
by herself before.

591
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:16,633
Now she cooks and works.

592
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:22,367
She's working as hard as she can.

593
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,667
Let's trust Nao, all right?

594
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm glad we came to Tokyo.

595
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:36,367
My life's been shortened
by three years, though.

596
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,667
<i>And I was so glad to find out
that everyone likes Nao.</i>

597
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,700
<i>Yep.</i>

598
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:49,900
<i>She'll be fine.</i>

599
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,433
<i>Just fine.</i>

600
00:41:57,367 --> 00:42:00,467
<i>-Let's go to sleep.
-OK.</i>

601
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,100
These are really good.

602
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,133
Yum!

603
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:43,900
Hey! That's mine!

604
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:45,734
Does it have your name on it?

605
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,133
But how many is that for you?

606
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,500
My second, I think.

607
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,467
No way. That's a total lie.

608
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:52,900
OK, fine. I'll give you half.

609
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:56,100
Not half. This one is all mine!

610
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,800
<i>Hey! Have some cabbage!</i>

611
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:05,100
<i>What? Hey! OK, I'm taking that!</i>

612
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,567
How many times
are you going to wipe the same place?

613
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,567
Oh, sorry, sorry.

614
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:20,734
What are you so happy about?

615
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,700
I can't help it. It was always bugging me.

616
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,066
Keeping it all a secret from my parents.

617
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:28,033
But from now on,

618
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,066
we can be in the open about everything.

619
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:34,100
Yeah, OK, whatever.

620
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,400
Nao, you can go whenever you like.

621
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:38,333
OK.

622
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:40,934
-Oh, Issei.
-Uh-huh?

623
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,400
Can I wait here for a while?

624
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:47,734
Uehara said he was going to meet me here
on his way home from work.

625
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,200
Go right ahead.

626
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:50,900
Thank you.

627
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,400
Welcome!

628
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:02,734
Oh, thanks for coming again.

629
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:07,900
-Issei.
-Yes?

630
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,667
I... I can't forget about you.

631
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,367
Well, uh...

632
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:16,233
I told you this before, but I--

633
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,633
I love you!

634
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,633
Please be my boyfriend!

635
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:24,867
I'm sorry, but I can't be your boyfriend.

636
00:44:25,066 --> 00:44:26,800
But why not?

637
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,333
You don't have a girlfriend now, right?

638
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,567
I heard that your only love is ramen,
and you don't have a girlfriend.

639
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:33,900
Who said that?

640
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Dad!

641
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:41,467
I bet you think

642
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,367
that a girl like me
isn't a good match for you.

643
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:48,533
No, it's not that.

644
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:51,767
Jeez, what should I do?

645
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,066
Hey! What're you doing?

646
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:01,500
This here is my girlfriend!

647
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,500
So, I'm sorry, I can't go out with you.

648
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,066
Yow! That's hot!

649
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,400
I put my hand right in the pot!

650
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:47,700
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
