1
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,433
Nao.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,333
I... want to live alone.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
What?

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,367
{\an8}The real reason I moved out of my house

5
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,400
{\an8}was because of Yuri, but also...

6
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,000
{\an8}because I wanted to live on my own.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,834
I've really wanted to ever since
my brother got married.

8
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:44,033
I knew it was time to stop relying
on my brother for everything.

9
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,800
So, I think this is a good chance to...

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,500
Nao!

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,066
Why are you crying like that?

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,700
Don't you like me anymore, Uehara?

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,066
What?

14
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,767
Were you even listening to me?

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,333
Yes, I was, but...

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,567
Don't you want to be
with the person you love?

17
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,367
Listen to me, would you?

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,867
If we let things stay this way,
we'll be living together forever.

19
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,734
That can be kind of dull.

20
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,433
It's not dull!

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't want to.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,934
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

23
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,300
-I'm against it.
-Nao!

24
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,467
Fine. I'm going to work.

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,066
You cool off and clear your head.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,367
Think it over when you're calmer.

27
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,300
Nao!

28
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,066
Marina!

29
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,967
Whoa! What's the matter?

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,333
Uehara dumped me.

31
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,667
-What?
-What?

32
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,200
<i>So, no more living together.</i>

33
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,266
But he didn't say he wanted to break up,
right?

34
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,834
Yeah,

35
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,667
but it's like the only reason
we're a couple is

36
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:06,433
that we're living together.

37
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,467
Even now I feel insecure about us.

38
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:15,066
What if someone else
was living with him?

39
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,900
He'd probably end up liking
them instead of me.

40
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,066
Uh-oh, her downward spiral has begun.

41
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,166
Don't you worry.

42
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,200
I know that Uehara loves you, Nao.

43
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,166
-He does?
-That's right.

44
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,900
But I don't think he's ever
actually told me that.

45
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,967
Jeez! No matter what you say,
it won't help.

46
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,300
Calm down, would you?

47
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:40,300
Why don't you tell me again exactly
what he said to you, OK?

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,000
"If we let things stay this way,
we'll be living together forever.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,967
That can be kind of dull."

50
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,133
Don't cry.

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,934
You know, that sounds more like
he's asking you to marry him.

52
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,767
-Huh?
-What do you mean by that?

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,834
It sounds like he's saying

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,100
that he's going to be with Nao forever,
right?

55
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,066
Yeah.

56
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:13,433
The future that Uehara pictures
for himself includes Nao!

57
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,633
So, what does that mean?

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,100
-Oh! Marriage?
-That's right!

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,967
What? You really think so?

60
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:35,967
{\an8}MILK PUDDING

61
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,800
-Marry me.
-OK.

62
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,567
<i>Marry me.</i>

63
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,133
I'm so happy for you!

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh, cut it out, Marina.

65
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:57,133
Wow! I never thought Uehara
would propose to Nao!

66
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,567
"Marry me!"

67
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,066
Stop teasing me.

68
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,133
-Let me have a chance!
-No way!

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,400
So he was getting ready for marriage
by living together. What a stud.

70
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:09,900
-You're crazy to be jealous about that?
-It's kind of arousing.

71
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,033
-You've got a filthy mind.
-No, I don't!

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,367
<i>Did you hear that Uehara
asked Nao</i>

73
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,166
-to marry him?
-Seriously?

74
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:21,367
-What a shock!
-I'm so jealous!

75
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:24,734
-I wonder what her answer was.
-Me too.

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,367
It's all just a rumor.

77
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,433
I'll never believe it.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,667
But everyone's saying it,

79
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:34,033
that Uehara proposed to her.

80
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,266
What?

81
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,133
I thought the blackmail thing
was solved.

82
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,633
-We thought it was, but...
-But what?

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,967
The notes at school
were done by someone else.

84
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:59,667
I can't believe this.

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,767
Is that you, Issei?

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh, I, uh...

87
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,700
Is something wrong?

88
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:12,600
I, uh, just happened to be passing by.

89
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,600
You must be checking up on Nao.

90
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,967
What? No, of course not! Are you nuts?

91
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,633
Hey, let's go back together.
I was thinking of dropping by for ramen.

92
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,033
OK.

93
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,467
Today I've really got to lift my spirits
with your ramen.

94
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,967
What happened?
Were you turned down again?

95
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:33,900
Actually, this is even worse than that.

96
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,133
Really?

97
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:40,333
I heard that Uehara asked Nao
to marry him.

98
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,767
Marry him?

99
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:47,533
It's really tough to handle
when it's a girl you like.

100
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,533
Are you coming, Issei?

101
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,967
Sorry, but you go on ahead.

102
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,900
-Why?
-Sorry.

103
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:19,900
The food is great.

104
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,600
I hope he's home soon.

105
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,900
Welcome home.

106
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,033
Thanks.

107
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,066
Today I pulled out all the stops for us.

108
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,767
I can see.

109
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,200
She's as high as a kite.

110
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,166
-What is it?
-Nothing.

111
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,233
Here you go. There.

112
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,233
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat!

113
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,066
How is it?

114
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,867
I haven't eaten anything yet.

115
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,066
How is it?

116
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:10,900
-Good.
-Do you like it?

117
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:11,834
It's delicious.

118
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm so glad!

119
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,367
Bon appétit.

120
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,967
By the way, about moving--

121
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,300
Oh! I'll talk to the landlady about it.

122
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,367
I've got to have a positive outlook.

123
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,667
Yeah.

124
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,500
This is so delicious.

125
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,934
I'm not sure what I should do.

126
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,734
EVENING STAR RAMEN

127
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,834
-Oh, Uehara.
-Hi.

128
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,967
-Aren't you going in?
-No, I'm OK.

129
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,200
Come on! Let's eat together!

130
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,433
Oh, they're still closed,
but it'll be OK.

131
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,367
Or are you too embarrassed to go in?

132
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,467
Why?

133
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,800
Don't act dumb. I heard all about it.

134
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,867
Yeah, you proposed to Nao, right?

135
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:33,934
No, I didn't.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,967
Oh, you! Don't be ashamed.

137
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,233
Like I said, I never proposed to her.

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,967
Really?

139
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,367
I've heard all the rumors, but...

140
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,667
I didn't.

141
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,934
Have you told Nao?

142
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,367
How could I?

143
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,600
-Let's go!
-What? Why?

144
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,266
The sooner you tell her, the better.

145
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,166
We can't talk about this
while she's working.

146
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,900
It's fine. They're closed.

147
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,467
It'll be easier to laugh it off
with other people around.

148
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,767
If you told her when you're alone,

149
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,934
Nao could die from shock.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
She's right.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,567
Besides, we might be
a little responsible for the rumors.

152
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,734
-What?
-Well, you see...

153
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,900
At any rate, let's go inside.

154
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah, let's!

155
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,900
Sorry, but we're not open yet.

156
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:28,967
Uehara!

157
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,200
Nao.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,233
What are you all doing here?

159
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:37,867
RENTAL INFORMATION

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,767
So, you went to a rental agency.

161
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,033
Are you guys moving?

162
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
-Yeah.
-Really?

163
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:50,333
We had a long talk,
and decided to live separately.

164
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,433
What? But why?

165
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,166
-Well...
-We've got our reasons.

166
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:58,633
-What reasons?
-It's none of your business.

167
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,867
-Didn't you propose?
-No, I didn't!

168
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,300
What?

169
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,633
What's going on here?

170
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:12,633
Uehara?

171
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:23,233
I really don't remember
saying anything like that.

173
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:37,033
Uh... It's opening time.

174
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,333
Oh, yeah... that's right!

175
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:54,100
-Nao?
-Keep a grip on yourself.

176
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,533
OK. I'll be fine.

177
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,033
Do your best at work, Uehara.

178
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,467
I will.

179
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,600
Bye.

180
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:09,767
Bye.

181
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,166
Nao!

182
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,767
Hey! Wake up!

183
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:54,834
You OK?

184
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,033
I'm sorry, Issei.

185
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,700
It's OK. Lie back down.

186
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:06,266
-What about the shop?
-It's fine.

187
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,400
Dad brought us here by car,
then he went back.

188
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:13,033
I see. Sorry.

189
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:17,600
I can't believe you passed out.

190
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,033
-Issei?
-Yeah?

191
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,567
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

192
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,233
Well, yeah, sure.

193
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,100
Did you ever argue?

194
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,600
Of course.

195
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:46,567
Did you ever think

196
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,066
"I can't understand a woman's feelings"?

197
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,734
You bet.

198
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,266
I see.

199
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,767
I guess it's only natural.

200
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,467
Everyone probably thinks the same thing.

201
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,100
Hey, look,

202
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,867
if you can't understand
what a guy's thinking, then ask me.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,133
OK?

204
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,433
Once upon a time...

205
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:31,967
Huh?

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,367
There was a couple that lived together.

207
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,066
Then suddenly, one day

208
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:49,467
the guy said
he wanted to live separately.

209
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:52,800
Can you tell me why he said that?

210
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,400
Is that what Uehara said?

211
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,800
What's wrong with him?

212
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,567
Why did he say it?

213
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,133
Because he...

214
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,600
stopped liking her.

215
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,133
I see.

216
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:58,767
I thought he was actually
asking to marry me.

217
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,467
I'm such an idiot.

218
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,834
How could you possibly think
he was asking you to marry him?

219
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,166
Issei?

220
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,266
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,233
I didn't mean anything by that.

222
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,100
You surprised me.

223
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,133
You know...

224
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,266
Yes?

225
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,000
I want you to be mine.

226
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,867
Are you joking again?

227
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:09,266
Of course it's a joke. Don't be silly.

228
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,133
Oh, cut it out, Issei.

229
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,266
OK, I'm going now.

230
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,800
-OK.
-Bye.

231
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,900
Thanks so much, Issei.

232
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,633
No problem.

233
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,433
I brought her home.

234
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,834
So her job comes with a free ride too?

235
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,000
She fainted!

236
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,967
What?

237
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,333
I thought I told you
not to make her cry.

238
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,800
I'd never let her cry like she does.

239
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,100
Take good care of her, dammit.

240
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,667
How are you feeling?

241
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,300
Good. I'm just fine.

242
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,200
Hello? Issei?

243
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,233
-I'm going.
-Huh?

244
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,700
Thanks for yesterday.

245
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,633
<i>Take the day off today.
That's an order from your boss.</i>

246
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:37,166
Today, first period is self-study.

247
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,100
-Yes!
-All right!

248
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,934
OK, quiet down! Quiet down!

249
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,266
-Nao.
-Yes?

250
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,166
Come with me to the counselling room.

251
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,800
Really?

252
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:52,200
{\an8}SELF-STUDY

253
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,700
Nao and Uehara are living together.

254
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,467
<i>We received this.</i>

255
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,400
And we've heard some rumors
that we cannot ignore.

256
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,667
<i>When we hear rumors like this,</i>

257
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:15,033
we have no choice
but to confirm their validity.

258
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
<i>Is it true that</i>

259
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,934
you're living with Yoshikawa Nao
of D class?

260
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,266
Well...

261
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,533
Yes, it's true.

262
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:30,834
We were the victims of fraud.

263
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:34,066
<i>We didn't have the money to move...</i>

264
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,734
<i>So that's the reason
you couldn't help living together?</i>

265
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,767
Yes.

266
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,033
<i>Do your parents know about this?</i>

267
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,033
<i>I understand the situation clearly.</i>

268
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,767
However, as a school,

269
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:52,633
we cannot give tacit approval to an
under-age boy and girl living together.

270
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,967
I think you understand.

271
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:55,667
Yes.

272
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,767
<i>We're going to call your parents now,</i>

273
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,767
and ask them to come
to the school tomorrow.

274
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:05,667
We'll decide what to do
after we talk to your parents.

275
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,400
<i>Do you understand?</i>

276
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

277
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,934
I'm sorry for causing this trouble.

278
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:25,400
It's from Uehara.

279
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:30,467
{\an8}From: Uehara
I'll stay at my work tonight.

280
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,567
{\an8}It's Mom.

281
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,500
Hello?

282
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,934
<i>Nao?</i>

283
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:56,300
<i>Is it still cold there?
Do I need to bring a coat?</i>

284
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,133
I'm sorry about this, Mom.

285
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:07,100
<i>Don't worry. It will work out somehow.</i>

286
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,567
<i>But, Nao...</i>

287
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,433
<i>I don't think you'll be able to
live there any longer.</i>

288
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,300
I know.

289
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:27,333
Evening Star Ramen!

290
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:30,533
Oh, it's the ramen. This way, please.

291
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,000
OK, thank you.

292
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:38,967
About the bowls, I'm terribly sorry.

293
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:44,066
It's OK. Your father came and apologized
about that the other day.

294
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:47,333
But it was me that broke them.

295
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,867
I really am very, very sorry.

296
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,066
Oh, forget about it.

297
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,266
I'll bring you payment.

298
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,000
<i>So, Uehara, you've made up your mind?</i>

299
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,033
<i>If we keep living together like this
in secret,</i>

300
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,567
<i>it's only going to end up hurting her.</i>

301
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,333
<i>Hello?</i>

302
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:39,967
It's me.

303
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:42,166
Yes.

304
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,900
<i>Have you had dinner?</i>

305
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,166
Yeah. And you?

306
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,867
The landlady treated me to dinner.

307
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:58,300
<i>So you're looking for a place?</i>

308
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:03,533
Yeah. She said she could get me a place
pretty quickly.

309
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:10,333
I see. That's great.

310
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,100
<i>Yuri got called to the school
for tomorrow.</i>

311
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,200
Yuri's back in Japan?

312
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:25,367
<i>Yeah. What about your parents?</i>

313
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,700
They'll be at school tomorrow.

314
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,500
I see.

315
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,367
I wonder what's going to happen to us.

316
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,767
I have no idea either.

317
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:46,400
Uehara?

318
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:48,900
Yeah?

319
00:25:53,967 --> 00:26:00,700
Do you... regret... living together?

320
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:04,800
What about you?

321
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:13,200
Not in the least. It surprises me.

322
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,400
That's because you hardly think
about it at all.

323
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,967
You're so mean!

324
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:26,734
I'm thinking about it a lot.

325
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,700
<i>Liar.</i>

326
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,500
You're even getting ready
to go to bed now.

327
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,767
What? How did...

328
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,233
Go ahead. Get to bed. Talk to you later.

329
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,100
Wait! Hold on--

330
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,767
I don't regret it either.

331
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,433
Bye.

332
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
Let's go, Nao.

333
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:24,500
OK.

334
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,266
-What's our next class?
-I'm not sure.

335
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,900
Where is it?

336
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,734
-Nao.
-Huh?

337
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,834
Are you looking for your key?

338
00:27:58,934 --> 00:27:59,900
Yes.

339
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,066
Did it have a ribbon key holder?

340
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,133
Give it back!

341
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,600
That's no way to ask.

342
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,500
Where is it?

343
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:14,567
Shiori found it on the floor,
so she's taking it to the police.

344
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,834
Uehara, Nao hasn't come back from P.E.

345
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,166
Really?

346
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,467
Hey, Mitsuishi. Have you seen Nao?

347
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,233
She ran out of here just a second ago.

348
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,033
Is something wrong?

349
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,700
Uehara!

350
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,233
Are you really going to leave her?

351
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:53,767
It's none of your business.

352
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:56,233
-Yes, it is our business!
-That's right.

353
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,934
We all want you two to be together.

354
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:03,400
Come on.
Try to understand why Nao's insecure.

355
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:07,467
She can't tell what your feelings are
unless you tell her.

356
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,133
Stop!

357
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:24,233
Stop!

358
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:26,333
Stop!

359
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,033
Give me back my key.

360
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,767
What are you talking about?

361
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:36,600
It's very important to me. Give it back.

362
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,800
There's no way
you two are living together!

363
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,233
Uh-oh.

364
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,133
I'm terribly sorry for all this trouble.

365
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,834
Please have a seat.

366
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,133
I'd like you to look at these.

367
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:29,266
Can you believe her?
She's lost her mind.

368
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,934
That's cold!

369
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,433
<i>She is my girlfriend.</i>

370
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,667
<i>Lean on others when you need to.</i>

371
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:56,166
<i>Don't worry. I'm not interested
in anyone but you right now.</i>

372
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,867
<i>Uehara, I like you.</i>

373
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,767
<i>I'll treasure it forever.</i>

374
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,967
<i>"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."</i>

375
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,133
<i>There you go crying again.</i>

376
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,333
<i>You mean to tell me
that you knew they were living together?</i>

377
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,166
Yes, of course we did.

378
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:45,667
What the hell are you doing, Nao?

379
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,767
Nao!

380
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,567
My key!

381
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:58,100
If I lose that,
then it really <i>will</i> be all over.

382
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,834
Stop this and calm down!

383
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,400
Let go of me!

384
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,734
Nao!

385
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,667
I...

386
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,166
I lied to you.

387
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,967
Huh?

388
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,066
The real reason a guy says
he wants to live separately

389
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:43,533
is that he doesn't want to hurt the girl.

390
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,033
Thank you, Issei.

391
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:31,567
Hello?

392
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,433
The situation was really very complex.

393
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,200
We worried over it
quite a bit ourselves.

394
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:03,600
And we talked it over good
and long with our daughter.

395
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:08,300
But I still don't think
living together was a solution.

396
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:11,800
They're only 17.
And they're a boy and a girl.

397
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,900
Uhm...

398
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:20,133
-It's not just the two of them alone.
-Really?

399
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,133
I'm living with them too.

400
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,266
I don't understand.

401
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:28,800
Uehara's older brother is my husband.
He's working overseas now.

402
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,400
So I'm living with Uehara
and Nao here in Japan.

403
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:35,300
It's more like Nao is boarding with us.

404
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:39,467
So it's not just those two alone?

405
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:42,066
No, of course not!
They're only high-school kids.

406
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:42,967
Then what about these?

407
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,266
Oh, there's a lot of that.

408
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,967
Uehara's fans always
make a mountain out of a molehill.

409
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:51,467
-He really is handsome, isn't he?
-You think so?

410
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,500
Oh, please.

411
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,467
Don't tell me that you were fooled
into thinking this was true?

412
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,266
No, we weren't taken in.

413
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,467
No, of course you weren't.

414
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,667
However, due to these rumors,

415
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:05,300
we'll have to ask
that she stop living there.

416
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,967
-We don't want other students to see.
-I see.

417
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,900
We've already decided on moving her out.

418
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:15,934
-Oh my god. She's still at it.
-What an idiot.

419
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,533
This is hilarious.

420
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
I think I'll just start sending this out.

421
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,367
I heard Nao's parents were called in
by the vice principal.

422
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:26,400
-Seriously?
-Because of this.

423
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,567
Oh, yeah! That!

424
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:31,066
That really sent the teachers
into a panic.

425
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,266
What are you doing?

426
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,066
Hey!

427
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,867
I couldn't care less anymore.

428
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,033
Really?

429
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,200
I couldn't care less about Uehara
or her anymore.

430
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,266
Let's go.

431
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,800
I guess she thinks
she doesn't have a chance with him.

432
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,900
Hey, wait up.

433
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,066
Hey! Nao!

434
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,667
-What are you doing?
-Uehara.

435
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:16,400
I lost my key, Uehara.

436
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,033
Wait! My key.

437
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,266
Nao... let's go home.

438
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,300
-But--
-Don't worry about it.

439
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,533
Thank you.

440
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,967
-Nao?
-Yes?

441
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:51,867
Could you tell me why you thought
I was asking you to marry me?

442
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:54,867
Huh?

443
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:58,467
No matter how much I think about it,
I can't figure it out.

444
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,934
Yeah, you're right.

445
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,166
Now that I think about it,
I don't know what I was thinking.

446
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:12,433
I let myself get all carried away.

447
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,000
Were you really that happy about it?

448
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Of course I was happy.

449
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,467
However...

450
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,033
even though
that wasn't my meaning then...

451
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,500
I...

452
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,133
I <i>do</i> want to be with you forever.

453
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:54,133
I don't know what the future holds,
but that's how I feel right now.

454
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,266
Even if it's not here,
and even if we live separately,

455
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,500
let's be together forever.

456
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,667
OK.

457
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:37,567
So you're going to move.

458
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,433
I'll miss you.

459
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:42,667
Uhm...

460
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,934
I have another favor to ask you.

461
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,967
Come in.

462
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:52,700
-Long time no see!
-Daichi! Nice to see you!

463
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:53,700
Come in.

464
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:54,767
-Is everyone here?
-Yeah.

465
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,967
Oh, long time no see.

466
00:39:57,033 --> 00:39:58,767
-Daichi!
-Hi!

467
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,633
That university smell
makes you even more handsome.

468
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,200
-Really?
-Yes.

469
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:05,567
Hi.

470
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,667
-It's been a while.
-Who's that? Introduce me.

471
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:08,967
You're just a kid still.

472
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:11,433
What are you talking about?
Come on, introduce me.

473
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,333
Here you go. It's ready.

474
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:14,900
It's shrimp.

475
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:19,367
Look at you!
You're as handsome as ever, Daichi!

476
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:23,400
He's handsome too.
Who's that? Introduce me.

477
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,967
How come she's not asking who I am?

478
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,800
She's ignoring me too.

479
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,567
Thank you.

480
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,266
Thank you!

481
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,967
Do you want some pot stickers?

482
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:51,700
Thank you. Here's the soy sauce.

483
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:53,066
Thanks. Pour some on.

484
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,166
It's time to propose a toast
to Uehara and Nao's future together.

485
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,133
Wait! Is that alcohol?

486
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,467
Don't be such a wet blanket.

487
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,367
OK. Cheers!

488
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,133
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

489
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,533
<i>My lease here starts from today.</i>

490
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,233
What are you talking about?
Look, Room 305!

491
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,433
Me too, Room 305!

492
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,600
-Huh?
-Huh?

493
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:39,934
Are you packed?

494
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,567
Yep.

495
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,734
<i>Polar Bear Moving!</i>

496
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:48,066
-Coming.
-Coming.

497
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:05,000
OK, I'll see you.

498
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,166
Yeah.

499
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,300
The truck is that way.

500
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,233
Mine's that way.

501
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:14,567
OK.

502
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,667
Bye.

503
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,834
Bye.

504
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,867
Uehara!

505
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,767
Sorry. It's nothing.

506
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:53,934
See you.

507
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:04,800
Nao!

508
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,166
I love you.

509
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,100
I know.

510
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:07,633
Room 305 is vacant now.

511
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:11,900
But there's a condition
regarding the length of the lease.

512
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:13,967
SQUIRREL MOVERS

513
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,934
Here goes!

514
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,800
Thank you. Good bye.

515
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:35,767
Ah!

516
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:39,767
I'm sorry!

517
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,233
Uehara.

518
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:52,166
Why are you here?

519
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,133
Why am I here?

520
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,567
Because this is where I live now.

521
00:44:58,767 --> 00:44:59,834
I'm in 402.

522
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:02,433
Really?

523
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,100
Where are you?

524
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:10,333
I'm... in 401.

525
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:14,500
Oh... do you think...

526
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:17,700
-the landlady did this?
-the landlady did this?

527
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,066
<i>I have another favor to ask.</i>

528
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:29,934
Three years from now
when we're adults,

529
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,300
I'd like to move back into that place...

530
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,834
<i>with her.</i>

531
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:38,500
RENTAL AGREEMENT

532
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:41,967
{\an8}OCCUPANT: UEHARA HISASHI
TERM: JUNE 7, 2018 to JUNE 6, 2020

533
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,767
We're neighbors.

534
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:47,233
What was the point in moving?

535
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,767
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
