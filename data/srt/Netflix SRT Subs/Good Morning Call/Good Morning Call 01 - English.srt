1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,000
ROOM 305

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,734
Alright!

3
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,800
Good morning.

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,767
Hey, about tomorrow...

5
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:45,700
Tomorrow?

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,500
He is here, he is here! Excuse me.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,367
Quickly, quickly!

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Oh my God!

9
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:25,600
Second Grade A class! Uehara Hisashi.
He's so cool.

10
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,800
Any cool guy, that's enough for you right?

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,000
But he's just so cool!

12
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,700
Just looking at him gives me strength.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Uehara!

14
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes?

15
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,767
Um, we would really like you to join

16
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,500
our first year Xmas party
as a special guest.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,567
This is an invitation.

18
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,400
I don't want it.

19
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:12,100
You must have a death wish,
breaking the "Top three" rules like that.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,867
The top three boys are for everyone.

21
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:19,200
It is unforgivable for you,
especially when you're a freshman.

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,734
Let's discuss things slowly.

23
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,667
You must be taught the rules properly.

24
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,200
INCOMING CALL
FROM MOM

25
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:50,900
Wait... hang on...

26
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,667
Hello, hang on a second.

27
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,100
Hang on.

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,934
What do you want, Mom?

29
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:04,200
I called them. Don't worry about it.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,100
<i>Just make sure you do things properly.</i>

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,100
<i>If anything happens,
I'll come straight away.</i>

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,934
Got it. OK, I've got to go.

33
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,100
Hey.

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,200
You scared me!

35
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
What did you want to talk about?

36
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,400
What?

37
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,500
I don't want to go out with anyone.

38
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:33,967
Also, I don't know how you got my address,
but this kind of threat is unacceptable.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
{\an8}"Dear Uehara Hisashi,

40
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,900
{\an8}I'll be waiting on the roof at lunchtime.

41
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,100
{\an8}If you don't come..."

42
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
{\an8}Oh my God! That's scary.

43
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:49,467
You're surprised even though you wrote it?

44
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,600
Huh? You've confused me with someone else.

45
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,967
I didn't write that mail.

46
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,000
I see...

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Hey, you made a mistake!
What's with the attitude?

48
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:08,934
And...

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,300
You should speak more kindly to girls.

50
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,600
You even let them down.

51
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:22,500
What would you do if they jumped for real?

52
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:26,467
Leave me alone.

53
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,800
Hey, I'm just trying to help--

54
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,000
Hey,

55
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,500
your zipper is undone.

56
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Just saying it to be kind.

57
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,600
You're the worst!

58
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,200
So when are we going to do this?

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
Her really important friend...

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,667
-Got it.
-Got it.

61
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,100
Nao?

62
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,734
-What?
-Here you go.

63
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
What's this?

64
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,400
A bit early, but, it's a moving gift
from Marina and I.

65
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,800
Really? For me?

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,967
Thank you, can I open it?

67
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,300
Of course.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,700
I wonder what it is.

69
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
What?

70
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,100
The perfect item for a girl living alone!

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
Keep away robbers by hanging it
on the balcony.

72
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,667
It's also good as pajamas!

73
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,400
Ta-da!

74
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,200
What's wrong? Isn't it funny?

75
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,900
What? Did you even gift wrap it?

76
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,500
It's Mitsuishi's old ones!

77
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,567
Just a joke!

78
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
-Really? Sorry.
-How rude!

79
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:10,800
What is this?

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,300
Nao!

81
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,834
Oh... Daichi!

82
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,200
Hang on.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Hi, Daichi.

84
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,200
-Good Morning.
-Hi.

85
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,100
What the heck is that?

86
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,500
It's from these two,
in case there's a robber.

87
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, I see, you're moving tomorrow, right?

88
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,600
Had you forgotten?

89
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:37,300
Tomorrow, would you be able
to help us move, Daichi?

90
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,300
Sorry, I promised I'd go watch the match.

91
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,767
You still help them after retiring?

92
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,100
Sorry, I can't help.

93
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,967
No big deal. Come and visit anytime!

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,967
You shouldn't invite boys, you know!
You live by yourself now.

95
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you say?

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,834
Alright.

97
00:06:58,767 --> 00:06:59,767
-OK, see ya.
-Bye.

98
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Bye, bye.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,567
-He's so cool.
-What?

100
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,066
You've known him for so long.
You're slow-witted.

101
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,500
Daichi is the oldest guy of the top three

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,100
in Megurogaoka High School.

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
Top three?

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Nao, you're so naive...

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,100
They were selected at the Autumn Festival.

106
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,000
They selected the best guy
from each grade.

107
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,567
Daichi from the third grade
and Uehara Hisashi from the second grade.

108
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,500
Uehara...

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,500
I have never been selected...

110
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,834
It's OK.

111
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,600
What do you mean "it's OK?"

112
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,300
Don't worry about it.

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,667
THE MOVING DAY

114
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:45,900
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

115
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:47,967
This one!

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,500
What? Really?

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,700
Yep!

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,900
-It's amazing!
-Awesome! For real?

119
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,767
-Let's go!
-Please let us in.

120
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:03,800
Ta-da!

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Wow!

122
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,967
-What do you think?
-It's amazing!

123
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,000
It's furnished too!

124
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,000
-Yep.
-Hold on.

125
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,767
Wow, what an amazing kitchen!

126
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,100
Wait, what is this?

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,000
What's with this great sofa?

128
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,767
Yahoo!

129
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,100
Everyone, over here.

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
What is it, Mitsuishi?

131
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,200
It's so hot... so hot...

132
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,800
It's taking so long to arrange things.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
I'll do the rest.

134
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,467
As long as I have a bed, I'll be fine.

135
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,667
Thanks for all your help, you two.

136
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,967
-It's going to be tough living alone.
-Yeah.

137
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm really glad you're staying here, Nao.

138
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:10,066
-Marina!
-Nao!

139
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:17,100
This place is huge.
$800 for rent this? It's so cheap!

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Yep, even the agent said I was very lucky.

141
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,800
You sure there's no other reason?

142
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,300
-What?
-What?

143
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,800
Mitsuishi, don't say things like that.

144
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,700
I mean, come on.
In the heart of town,

145
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,100
a new, huge place like this is for $800.
It's too good to be true.

146
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,500
I wonder why the last tenant moved out?

147
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,767
I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,467
New job, getting married...

149
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:40,867
Dying...

150
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,100
This place

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,500
might be haunted.

152
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,567
You're really going home?

153
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Don't worry about what Mi said.

154
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,967
It's OK, I exorcised the place.

155
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm not sure flavored salt works the same.

156
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,667
It's cold.

157
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
I should get the table heater out first.

158
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,100
It will be fine.

159
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,400
<i>You've got mail.</i>

160
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,367
What the hell?

161
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,200
{\an8}FROM DATING SITE

162
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,867
{\an8}Junk mail.

163
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:56,300
Don't scare me!

164
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,867
-Robber!
-Ouch, ow, hey!

165
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,000
What?

166
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,467
Huh?

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You?

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

169
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,500
Hang on, why are you here?

170
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,600
Why? My lease here starts from today.

171
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,800
What are you talking about?
My lease starts here today.

172
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
-What?
-You sure you are in the right room?

173
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:02,900
Get out, get out.

174
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,900
Hey! That hurts.

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,100
It's you that are mistaken!

176
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Not me! Look, Room 305!

177
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,834
Me too, Room 305!

178
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,000
<i>-Huh?</i>
<i>-Huh?</i>

179
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:53,600
I get it, you're in the wrong building.

180
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
No, it's this one.

181
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,000
So, maybe you have the wrong floor?

182
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,500
Nope, definitely the third floor.

183
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,900
Sorry to interrupt,

184
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,200
I'll bring your things in now.

185
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,800
What?

186
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,600
CONTRACT FOR LEASE

187
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,934
What the...

188
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Exactly the same contents...

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
<i>The number you have dialed</i>

190
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,900
<i>has been disconnected.</i>

191
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,500
Let's go.

192
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,000
Hang on a second, where are we going?

193
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,800
REAL ESTATE, CLOSED FOR GOOD

194
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,667
Right, next place.

195
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
What?

196
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,000
This is a double contract, it's a scam.

197
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,800
-Scam?
-Scam?

198
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,667
Usually, there would be key money,

199
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:09,200
but in this case, there is none.

200
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:11,667
In addition,

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,767
they have taken two lots of fees
from both of you and run away.

202
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,200
Oh no...

203
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,967
You mean we can't get our money back?

204
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,767
Probably not possible.

205
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:32,600
So, who gets to live in the house?

206
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,200
It looks like Mr. Uehara made
his contract first, however,

207
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,200
whoever pays the $1500 rent first

208
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,367
can live there, no problems.

209
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,200
-$1500?
-$1500?

210
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,600
It says $800 on the contract.

211
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,967
These days, that kind of place

212
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,767
would never let for $800, right?

213
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,467
What?

214
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,200
Nao! Congratulations on your move.
From Daichi.

215
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,400
Looks like Daichi came after all.

216
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,567
Whether we move, or stay here for $1500,

217
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,900
we need lots of money.

218
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,467
I used all my savings to move here.

219
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,667
Can't you ask your parents for help?

220
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,567
Nope.

221
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,700
Why do you need to live alone?

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,600
-None of your business.
-Yes, it is!

223
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:58,800
How about you?

224
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:04,000
I live alone because my parents
took over the family farm in the country.

225
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,500
I will stay here alone, till I graduate.

226
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,667
There are no dormitories available now,

227
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:13,000
so I decided to live alone.

228
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Well, that's no big deal.

229
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,867
What do you mean? That's so rude.

230
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,800
You just stayed here because you didn't
want to live in the country, right?

231
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,300
You are relying
on your parents too, right?

232
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,200
Don't you have anyone else? Any relatives?

233
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,400
<i>If you need anything,
I'll come right away.</i>

234
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,834
No way...

235
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,300
If my parents find out,
they'll take me back to the country.

236
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,300
That's it!
Why don't we just live together?

237
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

238
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,900
Think about it, there are two rooms,

239
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,967
and we can split the rent,
making it cheaper than before.

240
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,900
This is no joke, you know.

241
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,500
Do you know what you're saying?

242
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,200
Yes, it's not forever,

243
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,834
just until we find a new place, OK?

244
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:30,800
No way.

245
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,300
Not possible.

246
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,000
Can you afford $1500 a month, Uehara?

247
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,767
I can't.

248
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,200
So I guess I'll just have to go.

249
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,100
But my old place has already let,

250
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:15,500
so I have absolutely nowhere to go.

251
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,300
Are you sure we can't make this work?

252
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Alright.

253
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:32,600
Really?

254
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,500
Yes, but just for now.

255
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500
Just for now, got it.

256
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Once we find a new place, we move.

257
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,734
-Both of us.
-Once we find a new place.

258
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:45,600
Once we both have the money or find
a new place, we'll move straight away.

259
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,767
When the girls' dorm is vacant, too.

260
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh, and we got nothing to worry about us.

261
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,600
What?

262
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm not interested in you at all.

263
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,767
Hey, same for me too!

264
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,100
I couldn't care less about you!

265
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,900
So, Uehara is moved by women's tears...

266
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,300
{\an8}THREE HOURS LATER

267
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,400
It's not enough.

268
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,667
And my room is still a mess!

269
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,467
Pizza!

270
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,767
I love pizza!

271
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,967
What? There's none for you.

272
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
What?

273
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,100
But you have so much!

274
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm going to eat it all.

275
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
You can have this.

276
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,500
KIDS MEAL COUPON

277
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,667
What the hell? Goddamn Kids Set!

278
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
How the hell is that skinny guy
going to eat all that pizza?

279
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,834
So selfish!

280
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
What are you upset about?
I'm the victim here.

281
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,900
-What's that?
-I made some rules.

282
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,900
"One, don't eat my things from the fridge.

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,367
Two, you have the bath until nine,
me, Uehara, after that.

284
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,834
Make sure you take a bath before that.

285
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,000
Three, clean the bathroom everyday
by turns.

286
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,000
Four, don't go in each other's room."

287
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,400
We can talk about the rest later.

288
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,867
Also, keep common areas clean!

289
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,200
-What a tiring...
-Also,

290
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,467
no boys allowed, okay?

291
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,600
I'm... not like that--

292
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,500
As if you have a boyfriend! Friends, too.

293
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,900
What, even girls?

294
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,300
It's not just your house,

295
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,200
and don't tell others we live together.

296
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,200
Don't talk to me at school either.

297
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,700
We are strangers, OK?

298
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,567
Got it.

299
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:06,600
I don't know the way.

300
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,567
Stay away, at least three meters.

301
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,100
Making rolled cabbage

302
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,000
What's up? Tired from moving?

303
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,000
Not so much...

304
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,900
I thought so.

305
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Living alone in a place like that...

306
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,967
Sounds like paradise!

307
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,900
-After I finish it...
-I'd give it to Uehara.

308
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,100
Should I give it to him?

309
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,667
But I don't think Uehara would
eat so much. He's so skinny.

310
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,200
You're right.

311
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,500
No, he is like a champion eating fighter!

312
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,700
Uehara is so popular with girls.

313
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,300
I really like him. He's so my type.

314
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,700
What do you mean?

315
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,300
-What?
-What?

316
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,000
Yesterday you said that

317
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,867
you like a kind person like Daichi.

318
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,700
To marry, for sure, Daichi.

319
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,800
To date though, Uehara for sure.

320
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,800
I see...

321
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,734
<i>Uehara!</i>

322
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,000
<i>Do you like rolled cabbage and mince?</i>

323
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,834
We made it just for you!

324
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,767
I can't accept that.

325
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,867
Is it an intrusion?

326
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
To be honest, yes.

327
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,467
Well, see ya.

328
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,000
He's still so cool...

329
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,000
What?

330
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,300
-Yeah, so cool.
-I don't care if he's cold.

331
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:14,000
COFFEE SHOP

332
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,667
I never thought you'd actually move.

333
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,500
Boss, I have a favor to ask.

334
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:29,600
What's that?

335
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,900
Could I get a few extra shifts?

336
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,667
I'm a bit broke after moving.

337
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,367
It's no big deal for me,

338
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,000
but are you sure
you need to work so hard to live alone?

339
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,867
Please.

340
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,500
Dad.

341
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
Hi, Nanako. Welcome home.

342
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,600
Hey, don't give him grief,

343
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,300
just give him some extra shifts, OK?

344
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,300
What?

345
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,300
You said that

346
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,900
the days Uehara works,
a lot more girls come.

347
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,767
I guess that's true.

348
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,900
If it's a hassle, don't worry about it.

349
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,667
I'm thinking of getting another job too.

350
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:03,900
No, you can't!

351
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,900
What?

352
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:08,300
I mean, you already work in the morning
at the gas station, right?

353
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,500
If you work too much, you'll get sick.

354
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,800
Hey, it's got nothing to do with you,

355
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,000
why don't you go

356
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,200
and do your studies.

357
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,000
She's hopeless.

358
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,500
I'll work out some extra shifts for you.

359
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,100
But, have you told your family yet?

360
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,600
Your new address and all that?

361
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,300
He's out every night... playing, no doubt.

362
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,734
What is that?

363
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,900
I can let you in if you want.

364
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,500
Hey, this is the common space--

365
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,967
The table heater is perfect for winter.

366
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:07,100
It's my first time seeing that thing.
It looks pretty plain.

367
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,300
Fine, I'll put it away if you want.

368
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,700
What?

369
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I mean...

370
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,867
Not now, you'll cause a commotion.

371
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,400
So cold.

372
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,800
What can I do?

373
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,066
I'm frozen from my part time job.

374
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,300
The table heater is ideal to warm you up.

375
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,600
Well...

376
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,200
The electricity cost is shared.
I am just getting my fair share.

377
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,300
You have a part time job?

378
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm no freeloader, that's why.

379
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Jeez, I'm so hungry.

380
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,600
You should have accepted it.

381
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,600
What?

382
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,400
The rolled cabbage from the girls.

383
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,100
What? Are you stalking me?

384
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,667
No, I just overheard. That's all.

385
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,200
We'll see.

386
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:17,734
Don't you like rolled cabbage?

387
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
No, it's one of my favorites actually.

388
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,000
Wow, you're strange.

389
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,900
But if I accept, it'll happen every day.

390
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,800
I see, it's so tough being popular.

391
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,300
INCOMING CALL
FROM MOM

392
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,600
-Hey, your phone's buzzing.
-Don't worry about it.

393
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,967
My mom is a pain,
calling three times a day.

394
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,500
You should answer.

395
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,300
Hi, Mom.

396
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,400
What is it?

397
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, I know.

398
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:16,100
So damn loud!

399
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:23,700
Uehara, your alarm is ringing.

400
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,600
Hey, wake up, it's so loud.

401
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,600
I'm coming in.

402
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,500
What is this?

403
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,800
So many alarms!

404
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,500
So damn loud.

405
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:00,767
If you're going to work,
turn them off first!

406
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:12,967
Wow, he has some cute side.

407
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,900
It says "H".

408
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,567
Ueha...

409
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,700
Excuse me.

410
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Welcome home, Uehara.

411
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,100
I'm so tired.
I'll take my bath in the morning.

412
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,700
Hey, Uehara.

413
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,967
Goodnight.

414
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,000
Hey, you didn't

415
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,967
go into my room, right?

416
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm so sorry.

417
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:07,300
The alarm clocks were all ringing,
so I was turning them off

418
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,667
and I accidentally dropped
the photo frame.

419
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,900
I'm really sorry.

420
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,367
We agreed not to go in each other's room.

421
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,467
You broke the rules, and my stuff.

422
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,300
It's too much.

423
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,100
I didn't mean to, and the alarm clocks...

424
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,100
I'll replace the frame.
The photo is fine--

425
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,667
That's not the issue!

426
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,400
What?

427
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,800
Forget it. It doesn't matter what I say.

428
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,934
You're taking this too far!

429
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,734
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Hi!

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,500
Marina, where's your lunchbox?

431
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,000
I just felt like a change, that's all.

432
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,900
I see what you're trying to do.

433
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,100
-Busted!
-What are you on about?

434
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,100
The top three boy, Uehara, buys bread too.

435
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,900
Nao, are you OK?

436
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,467
I'm fine.

437
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:38,567
She's trying to get close to him
at the bakery.

438
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:42,000
Wow, your private eye skills are amazing!

439
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,200
You know Uehara lost his parents
in a car crash when he was young.

440
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,500
That's why he always buys his lunch.

441
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,867
Didn't you know? Most people know this.

442
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,867
<i>Can't you ask your parents or something?</i>

443
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,200
Nope.

444
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,900
He's just so cool.

445
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:10,400
Alone in life...

446
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,000
Alone in life.

447
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,000
Nao?

448
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,867
Sorry, I've got to go.

449
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,734
<i>You know Uehara lost his parents
in a car crash when he was young.</i>

450
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,967
You're freeloading off your parents too.

451
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,767
My mom is a pain,
calling three times a day.

452
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,000
You should answer.

453
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,200
Forget it. It doesn't matter what I say.

454
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:18,800
Oh, no.

455
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,600
RE-USE SHOP

456
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,834
Forget it.

457
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,200
Alright...

458
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Excuse me, I'm looking for something.

459
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,867
It's a photo frame, there is an H here.

460
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,700
Nao!

461
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,767
Daichi.

462
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,500
-You're so late.
-Yes, I was looking for something.

463
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:25,200
-Were you at your sports club?
-Yes.

464
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,200
Because of sports, I got into university.

465
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:32,767
Everyone else is busy with their exams,
but I just kill time there.

466
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,100
Once you graduate, will you live alone?

467
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,767
No, even though the school is a bit far,
I'll commute from home, I think.

468
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:44,500
Living alone sounds great,
but it's tough, right?

469
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,967
Well, it's fun at the moment.

470
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:53,000
Cooking and doing laundry
sounds like a pain too.

471
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:56,400
I'm not so good at that stuff.

472
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,200
I'd probably order pizza every day!

473
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,800
That's pretty bad for you!

474
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,000
I know!

475
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,767
As you know, I'm pretty into sports.

476
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Yeah, you're right,
it is pretty tough living alone.

477
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:15,700
What, you're already over it?

478
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,000
Huh? No, that's not it.

479
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,700
That's good.

480
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,100
If you need anything, call anytime.

481
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,700
My mom was asking about you too.

482
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,200
Yep, thanks.

483
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,600
Perfect!

484
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,000
<i>Today's top news!</i>

485
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,900
<i>There have been ongoing random assaults
these past few days in Meguro District.</i>

486
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,100
<i>The victims were women in their 20's
attacked in residential areas.</i>

487
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,934
<i>They were attacked at the same time
in the same manner.</i>

488
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,800
<i>The local police are treating
these cases as connected.</i>

489
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,567
<i>The investigation is ongoing.</i>

490
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Still not home...

491
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,700
{\an8}MILK PUDDING

492
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,200
Maybe one of these is for me?

493
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,934
Welcome home.

494
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,000
Hey, Uehara.

495
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,100
Hey, you ate my milk pudding.

496
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,700
What?

497
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,300
This one?

498
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,700
There were two,
so I thought one was for me--

499
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,934
What the fuck?

500
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,200
Huh?

501
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,300
First you go in my room, break stuff,

502
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:12,600
and then you eat my food?

503
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,700
I feel really bad about that--

504
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,000
There is a limit to how much I can take!

505
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,667
Why are you so angry with me?

506
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
I get it...

507
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll buy a new one.

508
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,367
-That's it, right?
-Obviously!

509
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,700
If I go out at night and get attacked,

510
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,100
I hope it haunts you for life!

511
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,600
If anyone does dare to attack you,

512
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,400
I'd like to see his damn face!

513
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,200
Asshole!

514
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:56,934
It's just stupid pudding. What an asshole!

515
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:04,600
What's so special about him?
How is he the top three?

516
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,000
Excuse me.

517
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,300
Do you have milk puddings?

518
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,567
Sorry, all sold out for today.

519
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,367
I see.

520
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
<i>There's a store on the
other side of the station.</i>

521
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,900
{\an8}Dear Uehara, I'm so sorry.
From Nao.

522
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,934
So cold...

523
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,066
{\an8}<i>There have been ongoing random assaults
these past few days in Meguro District.</i>

524
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,900
I forgot my cell phone.

525
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:14,900
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

526
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,300
Did anyone come here and buy milk pudding?

527
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,300
Oh, yes.

528
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,934
She asked if we had any, so I told her
to go to the other side of the station.

529
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,500
Wow, milk pudding is so popular.

530
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,800
Uehara.

531
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,867
What are you doing?

532
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,767
I...

533
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,600
I...

534
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:20,734
I can't understand what you're saying.

535
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,500
Someone was chasing me.

536
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,367
I was scared, so I hid.

537
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:35,667
What the...

538
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:50,200
Uehara.

539
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,667
What are you doing here?

540
00:43:57,867 --> 00:43:59,100
What?

541
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
Oh...

542
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,100
I was going to buy some milk.

543
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,600
What an ugly face.

544
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,200
Okay, let's go home.

545
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:54,367
It's a bit difficult for me to say this...

546
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,100
You're so damn heavy,

547
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,600
and such a pain in the ass.

548
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,100
I'm really sorry about the photo frame.

549
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:26,400
You are right. I'm thoughtless.

550
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,667
The photo is your parents, right?

551
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:43,734
I didn't know you had lost them.

552
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:48,100
I didn't know anything.

553
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,000
You did well finding that same old frame.

554
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:12,867
But, it's not exactly the same.

555
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
I'm so sorry.

556
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,000
Rolled cabbage.

557
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,367
What?

558
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,300
For that, let's call it even.

559
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,667
Okay.

560
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
DELICIOUS MILK

561
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,400
There is already milk here.

562
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,934
Uehara, your alarms are going off.

563
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,200
Uehara.

564
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,467
So loud...

565
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,700
Everyone will be upset.

566
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,967
Uehara, the alarms...

567
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,834
You'll be late for work.

568
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Hey, get up.

569
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,667
Hey...

570
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:06,700
Yuri?

571
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,300
What?

572
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,667
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
