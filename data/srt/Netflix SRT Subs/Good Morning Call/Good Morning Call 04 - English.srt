1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,667
{\an8}<i>Then buy some nail clippers.</i>

2
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:13,600
{\an8}But I've got some.

3
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,767
{\an8}No, I mean expensive clippers
of your very own.

4
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,800
{\an8}But those are really nice.

5
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:18,900
{\an8}I'd rather use a nice--

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,867
{\an8}What's wrong?
You're staring off into space.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,100
You haven't eaten anything.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,667
I thought you were making your own lunch.
Are you already sick of it?

9
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:31,300
I overslept today.

10
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,300
Oh, sorry. What were you talking about?

11
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,700
I was telling you about this.

12
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:41,400
It says, "This Christmas is the best time
in your life for having a romance.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
There is an excellent chance
that whoever you spend Christmas Eve with

14
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,667
will be your partner for life."

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,100
Oh...

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,700
I'm really happy for you, Marina.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,400
It's not me. It's you, Nao.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,834
Really?

19
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,700
Haven't you made any progress
with Uehara?

20
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,000
Christmas Eve's in two weeks.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,767
These horoscopes are never right.

22
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,300
Don't tell me again this year,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,800
"I'm going to have a family party
at Daichi's house!"

24
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,000
A family party?
You mean your families get together?

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, exactly!

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Without fail,
ever since she was seven years old

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,100
their families gather
around a Christmas cake,

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,400
wear Santa hats, sing "Jingle Bells",

29
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:28,300
-and exchange presents.
-Unbelievable!

30
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:29,600
Isn't it?

31
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:33,400
Since your parents aren't here this year,
you can finally get away from Daichi!

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Then you can make Uehara yours!

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,300
I told you before,
I'm not interested in Uehara.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,467
-Speak of the devil.
-Uehara?

35
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,300
Nao.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,367
Daichi.

37
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, that one.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,667
-What's up?
-Here.

39
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,767
It's the TV drama you said you missed.

40
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,967
Oh, you remembered.

41
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,100
Argh! This is so frustrating.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,600
Well, until she accepts
her own feelings for Uehara,

43
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,367
it's never going to go anywhere.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,600
Uehara! What a stud!

45
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,100
Over here, Uehara! Look this way!

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,800
<i>He's so handsome.</i>

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,900
Good morning.

48
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,000
I guess he was up all night
at his part-time job again.

49
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Nao.

50
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:38,934
Yes? What... is it?

51
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,767
Your nose hair's sticking out.

52
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,734
Huh? Eek!

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,100
Ow. My back hurts.

54
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,900
I was just going to wash my face.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,900
-It's past noon, you know.
-So what?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Today's a holiday.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
What a slacker.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,300
Uehara, aren't you going out today?

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,934
I just got back from working
at the gas station,

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,600
and the cafe's closed today.

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,500
Huh? That means...

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,300
today, Uehara and I are...
alone together?

63
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:21,900
Oh!

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,100
So what? It's no big deal.

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,300
What are you doing?

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
What do you think?
I'm taking a shower.

67
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,900
But I'm in here now.

68
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,100
-Then shut your eyes for a second.
-What?

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
Wait! Stop! Stop that!

70
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,400
I'm coming.

71
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
-Oh, Yuri--
-Excuse me.

72
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,900
Sorry to barge in.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Yuri, what's with all the bags?

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,200
Sorry, but let me leave these here
for a bit.

75
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,700
There's a sale going on near here,
so I couldn't help buying all this.

76
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,700
Ta-da!

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
What do you think?

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,700
I bought this
for all the year-end parties.

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,100
It's so pretty, Yuri.

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you, Nao. You're so sweet.

81
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,400
Oh, yeah.
I want to give you some of my clothes.

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,400
What? Really?

83
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,300
You spend way too much on clothes.

84
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,700
So what if I do.
I earned it myself.

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
I can use it as I please.

86
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm letting you leave your bags here.

87
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,200
I bought you something too.

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,800
Do you think I'm a child
that can be pleased with--

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,300
{\an8}THE ORIGINAL <i>TAIYAKI</i>
MEDETAIYA

90
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:40,867
Oh my god!

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,867
That's one of the top three <i>taiyaki</i> shops,
Medetaiya.

92
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,900
Waiting in line for this wasn't easy.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Whoa!

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,600
Before you get this, say you're sorry.

95
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,600
-I'm sorry.
-I can't hear you.

96
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,767
-I'm sorry!
-Still can't hear you.

97
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,500
I said I'm sorry!

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,500
Say, "Thank you, Yuri."

99
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Thank you.

100
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,900
-Say, "I really appreciate--"
-Quit it. They're getting cold.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
OK, fine.

102
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,667
Oh, Nao, do you want one?

103
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,834
No. I'm going to go
buy something to drink.

104
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,100
Watch out!

105
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
Oh!

106
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,300
Are you all right?

107
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,367
-I'm sorry.
-It hurts.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,100
Oh...

109
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,834
No!

110
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:06,900
EVENING STAR RAMEN

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,100
<i>$12,000!</i>

112
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,000
{\an8}That's right. A loyal customer
specially asked a famous potter

113
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,100
to make these bowls.

114
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,900
Three bowls cost $12,000.
How are you going to pay for these?

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
You're kidding!

116
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,200
There's no point in trying
to get it from a high school kid.

117
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
I'll talk to your parents
and get it from them.

118
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:28,800
What's your parent's number?

119
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,967
-No, you can't.
-What?

120
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:36,600
Because of certain circumstances,
I'm not living with my parents now.

121
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:37,967
Oh!

122
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,900
If they found out about this,
they'd take me to the countryside.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,700
I couldn't care less.

124
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,600
Quit expecting special treatment
just because you're a high school kid.

125
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,400
Your problems have got nothing
to do with me.

126
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,500
Part-time help wanted,
$9 an hour

127
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Could I pay it off if I worked here?

128
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
{\an8}What?

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,934
{\an8}Part-time help wanted,
$9 an hour

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,300
Let me work here, please!

131
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,300
Are you nuts?

132
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,100
I'll work for the $12,000!

133
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:11,100
Dear Uehara,

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,700
I just remembered something I had to do,
so I won't be coming home until late.

135
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,600
Send.

136
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:26,800
I know I promised to do this,
but I'm not sure I can.

137
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,200
And these clothes... are hideous.

138
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,700
Totally hideous.

139
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,000
He said he didn't care
if these got dirty

140
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,800
{\an8}but these are junior high PE clothes.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,867
The gap between Yuri
and me is getting even bigger.

142
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,000
Eek!

143
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
What the hell are you doing,
you idiot?

144
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,000
How many more plates
are you going to break?

145
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,734
{\an8}WELCOME! WE'RE OPEN

147
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,467
I'm in so much pain.

148
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,300
I never thought it would be so hard.

149
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm home.

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
You sure are late.

151
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:26,400
Yeah, sorry.
Huh? Where's Yuri?

152
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,000
She left a long time ago.

153
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh! No!

154
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:38,867
If you want some ramen,
one serving is 89 cents.

155
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,934
No, thank you.

156
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,400
Where did this tree come from?

157
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,467
Oh, Yuri gave it to us.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,300
It's a housewarming present.

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,100
Wow.

160
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,667
I told her we didn't need it
because it'll get in the way.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,300
<i>"There is an excellent chance
that whoever you spend Christmas Eve with</i>

162
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,467
will be your partner for life."

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Uehara, you're working on the 24th, right?

164
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah. I work all night.

165
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,467
-I thought so.
-Huh?

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,100
Why do you ask?

167
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,467
No reason.

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
I just thought working
on Christmas Eve must be kind of lonely.

169
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,767
That's so stupid.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,700
It's only lonely people
that worry about that kind of thing.

171
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,400
Who said I was worried about it?

172
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,367
Then why did you ask?

173
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,767
Oh... Just forget about it.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,467
What a weirdo.

175
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,300
Damn him!

176
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Ow!

177
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,700
That hurts!

178
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,967
{\an8}<i>So you're working part-time
at a ramen shop to pay it off?</i>

179
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,300
{\an8}If you spend all your time working

180
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,867
you'll make even less progress
with Uehara.

181
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:18,000
Christmas Eve is... only ten days away.

182
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,767
How many times do I have to tell you?
I've got no feeling for Uehara.

183
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,500
-There you go again.
-I'm serious.

184
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,467
I mean, he complains about everything
and eats so much that it's frightening.

185
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:34,100
When we're together,
he totally looks down on me.

186
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,300
And he makes me feel so miserable.

187
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,567
In fact, now that I'm working,
we won't have to see each other.

188
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,200
It's probably for the better.

189
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,667
Huh?

190
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,900
"Will you spend Christmas with me?"

191
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,900
-Really? Who's it from?
-Marina!

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,900
"I'll be waiting for you on the roof
after school."

193
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,100
"Abe Jun."

194
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,100
Abe Jun. Isn't he in class B?

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,700
-Oh, it's just Abe.
-Huh?

196
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,700
He's finally gotten around to Nao.

197
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,100
Do you know him?

198
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Yeah.

199
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh!

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
I've got a great idea.

201
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
-Get over here, Mitsuishi. Come on.
-Nao...

202
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
No. You stay over there.

203
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,500
This is to help out Nao.

204
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,467
We'll tell Uehara...

205
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Nao.

206
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,600
Uhm...

207
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,900
I like you.
I've always been attracted to you.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
Please spend Christmas Eve with me.

209
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:01,300
Uhm, when I see you, Nao,

210
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:04,100
-I feel like I want to protect you.
-I feel like I want to protect you.

211
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
Huh?

212
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:09,500
My friend just told me about you.

213
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,367
You always tell the girls the same thing.

214
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,200
-<i>The king of the love confession?</i>
-<i>That's right.</i>

215
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,500
Abe's famous among some of the girls.

216
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,300
He's always falling in love.

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,100
Every girl he falls for, he texts,
then they all turn him down.

218
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,300
Is he really that unpopular?

219
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,300
Well...

220
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,100
He's not that bad looking.

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,800
But he's not the type you'd want
as a boyfriend.

222
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Nao would never go with a guy like that.

223
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,500
-But we can use him.
-We can?

224
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh! Uehara!

225
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,400
Wait! Wait! Uehara!

226
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,734
Can we talk for a minute?

227
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,800
Please.

228
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,300
I know you may not believe me,

229
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,000
but I <i>do</i> like you, Nao.

230
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,867
No. I'm sorry.

231
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,500
You mean it's true
that you and Uehara are dating?

232
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,900
What? Uh...

233
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, yes.

234
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,867
This world just isn't fair.

235
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,100
He's handsome, smart and good at sports.

236
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,900
He attracts girls without even trying.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,700
He hasn't got a worry in the world.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,100
Uehara has a lot of worries.

239
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,600
Really? He does?

240
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,867
Uh-huh.

241
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,900
He's got a couple of jobs
so he can earn living expenses.

242
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
But he doesn't even think

243
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,934
that he's got it harder than anyone else.

244
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:54,100
He may look selfish,
but he's always thinking of others.

245
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh, I see.

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But I'm still jealous of Uehara.

247
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,000
Really?

248
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,200
There's nobody I know

249
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,700
who would say things like that about me.

250
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,500
Yes, there is. I'm certain there is.

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,300
One day you'll meet someone

252
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:14,100
who can't live without you.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,300
But I'm not that person.

254
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,734
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Look.

256
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,000
That's the first time in her life
that anyone's told her they like her.

257
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,400
But she has no choice
but to turn him down.

258
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,600
Why?

259
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,200
Here at school,

260
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,900
everyone thinks you and she are dating.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,400
If she told him OK,

262
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,900
the rumor would spread
that she was two-timing you.

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,934
Imagine the punishment she'd get
from your fans.

264
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,100
And although she tries to spend
Christmas Eve with other friends,

265
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
they wouldn't let her join
since she has a boyfriend.

266
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,800
She's only doing it
because she's away from her family

267
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,100
and she's lonely.

268
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Isn't that right, Mitsuishi?

269
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah.

270
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,000
In fact, Marina and I've got
plans for Christmas Eve already.

271
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,200
So we can't spend it with her.

272
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,300
You know, I'm glad I talked to you, Nao.

273
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,867
I'm going to work hard
at developing a real relationship.

274
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,300
-Good.
-Bye.

275
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:22,300
What a pity.

276
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,200
She had to destroy a chance
that she'll never have again.

277
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,100
So, it would be kind of nice, you know,

278
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,967
if you showed just a little kindness
to Nao.

279
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,800
Of course Christmas Eve is special
for girls.

280
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,100
-It is?
-You see, girls just love

281
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,667
dressing up, feeling a thrill,
and experiencing love over and over again.

282
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,700
Christmas Eve is all that wrapped
into one.

283
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,500
Spending it all alone is like

284
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,300
God telling you that you're a failure
as a woman.

285
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
It's hard to believe you're still
in junior high.

286
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,667
So right now

287
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,500
all the girls are in a mad dash
to avoid spending it alone.

288
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:10,767
A mad dash?

289
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,000
What I mean is they're going to parties
and looking for a partner.

290
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,667
-What?
-Boys are the same, right?

291
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:20,600
Lately, even I've been asked out
by a lot of guys.

292
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,767
-Could it be...
-But there's already this guy I like.

293
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,400
That's why she's been coming home
so late recently?

294
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,100
For the time being,
I can only work at night.

295
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,000
But even if I work all day
after winter break starts on the 24th...

296
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,934
Ah...

297
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,500
How long will it take
to pay back the $12,000?

298
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,367
Oh... I know what to do.

299
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,200
Mom.

300
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,967
MOM

301
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,467
No, no, no...
I've got to deal with this myself.

302
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,500
Nine dollars an hour...

303
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,100
If I work eight hours a day...

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,700
What? That's all I'll make?

305
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,467
No!

306
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,900
Oh, dear.

307
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,400
What should I do?

308
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:34,400
It'll never happen.
I don't know what to do.

309
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,834
Ahh... I can't handle this.

310
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,200
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

311
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,800
{\an8}Here we are. Here's your miso ramen.

312
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:50,033
{\an8}It's such a pleasure
seeing your smiling face, Nao.

313
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,500
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

314
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Excuse me. Could I get some water?

315
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
Sure. I'll be there in a second.

316
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,400
In spite of everything,
she's fitting right in.

317
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,834
Why don't you take a quick break, Nao?

318
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,100
Well...

319
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I just don't feel right not working.

320
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,400
I mean,
I broke seven dishes in three days

321
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,400
and I wasted five bowls of ramen.

322
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,200
It's no big deal at all.

323
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes, it is a big deal, Dad.

324
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,767
-Welcome.
-Hi, Nao.

325
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,867
Marina. Mitsuishi. You came.

326
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,600
Look at you, Nao.

327
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,500
That's one crazy outfit.

328
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,667
But it oddly suits her.

329
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:30,700
Well...

330
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,600
I hate to admit it, but I agree.

331
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,000
Actually,
we've brought along a special guest.

332
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Really?

333
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,500
-We really just ran into him outside.
-Don't say that.

334
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,967
Yo.

335
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,500
Daichi.

336
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,100
Let's eat.

337
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,500
{\an8}We're done.

338
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,300
{\an8}That was delicious.

339
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,100
You've got quite an appetite, miss.

340
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,900
Oh, wow! What a nice looking guy!

341
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,600
-That's Issei, the bully.
-I see.

342
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,100
Call me Icchan.

343
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
All the customers do.

344
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,867
That was really good, Icchan.

345
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,600
It's really hard to believe
Nao's working a part-time job.

346
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
She believed in Santa Claus
until she was a sixth grader.

347
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
What? Seriously?

348
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,100
Every year, my dad dressed up as Santa
for Nao's sake.

349
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,967
It wasn't easy for me
to act like I was happy too.

350
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,900
You sure have a knack
for making people fret over you.

351
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,900
Sorry.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,500
It just shows how happy it made us
to see your reaction.

353
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,900
She would get all excited
over each little present.

354
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,200
That's right.
Ever since I was little,

355
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,900
I really looked forward to seeing
what present Daichi would get me.

356
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,500
I liked the prize
more than the candy it came with.

357
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,900
I liked the picture on the box
more than the game inside.

358
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,000
He always knew exactly
what would please me.

359
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,400
Nao!

360
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:05,900
-Yes?
-Quit slacking off.

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,400
-Get going.
-Sorry.

362
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,400
Enjoy yourselves.

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,300
-Nao.
-Yes?

364
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,300
If you don't have any plans
for Christmas Eve,

365
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,800
would you like to spend it together?

366
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
You can get it off
from the ramen shop, right?

367
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:29,300
Yeah.
It is a yearly tradition, after all.

368
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,300
I look forward to your mom's
juicy hamburger steaks.

369
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,100
This year,
why don't we spend it alone together?

370
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Huh?

371
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:40,867
The family party is fine,

372
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,400
but I thought you'd like
that kind of thing better, Nao.

373
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
-You don't have--
-Shh!

374
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,567
Go!

375
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,400
What's wrong?

376
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Is that Uehara?

377
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,200
I don't want him to see me like this.

378
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,900
Don't you dare tell Uehara
that I'm working this job.

379
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,100
OK.

380
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,300
Whew.

381
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:12,934
Thank goodness. Let's go.

382
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,467
Ow!

383
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,100
Hey, Nao!

384
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,500
How many times have I told you
to pick up your stuff?

385
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,300
Hey... Wake up.

386
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,867
I'm home.

387
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,400
Hi. Welcome back.

388
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:21,600
You OK?

389
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,934
I'm fine. Just a little tired.

390
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,467
What is it?

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,100
Such a nice smell.

392
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,500
Huh?

393
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:54,000
Pork soup base with Japanese broth.

394
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,567
Ah! Hey!

395
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,200
Cut that out.

396
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,400
I'm tired.

397
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:04,100
First I'll take a bath.

398
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,834
Oh, would you like to go somewhere
on the 24th?

399
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,567
What?

400
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:13,300
I got the day off from work.

401
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,567
Did you hear me?

402
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:23,934
Oh... Yes, I see.

403
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,100
OK... Where are we going?

404
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Where should we go?

405
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Oh... We could have dinner here.

406
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,000
Then we could see the Christmas lights
and take a walk.

407
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,300
OK, that's it. That's what we'll do.

408
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:45,900
What's with her?

409
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,300
Yes!

410
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,700
"Would you like to go somewhere
on the 24th?

411
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,567
I got the day off from work."

412
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,500
Yes! Yes!

413
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,200
Ow! Ow!

414
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,000
<i>Yes! Well done!</i>

415
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,900
{\an8}I can hardly believe it!
You're spending Christmas Eve

416
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
with our school's pride and joy,
a super-rare, high-class stud.

417
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Uehara just happened to get the day off
from work.

418
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:23,934
That's all.

419
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,867
He just kind of wondered
if I wanted to go somewhere, I think.

420
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,033
I don't particularly care
if we do or not.

421
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, whatever.

422
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,400
You can finally move on from Daichi, huh?

423
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:38,100
Oh, no!

424
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,667
Daichi is at a training camp
until tomorrow.

425
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:46,200
Oh, I see. Thank you.

426
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,800
I think it'll be fine.

427
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,300
Daichi did say,
"If you don't have any plans," right?

428
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:52,300
Yes.

429
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,567
But he said he wanted to spend it
alone together this year.

430
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,600
He just means spending it together
like siblings would, right?

431
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,800
I mean,
Daichi is one of the top three studs.

432
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:06,700
He could easily find someone
to spend Christmas Eve with.

433
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,767
In fact, I'm surprised you've been friends
for ten years.

434
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,900
Anyway,
I'll keep trying to get hold of him.

435
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:21,200
Oh, wow! I am so happy for you.

436
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,900
The day is coming soon

437
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,900
when you won't be faking it anymore,
but you'll really be his girlfriend.

438
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,400
I knew it. You're faking it.

439
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:31,000
Huh?

440
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
Whoa, Abe!

441
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,700
-Where'd you come from?
-Listen.

442
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,100
I haven't been able to get Nao
out of my head.

443
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,600
My, you're unusually slow
getting over it this time.

444
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,600
How could it possibly be true?

445
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
There's no way you're dating Uehara.

446
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,934
Nao, I don't know why you're doing it

447
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,900
but don't you feel it's meaningless
to fake being Uehara's girlfriend?

448
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,000
If so, then I--

449
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,600
Aah!

450
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,400
Keep quiet, Abe!

451
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,300
How about you and I go to a party
on Christmas Eve, OK?

452
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,900
There'll be swarms of cute girls there.

453
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,600
-Well, I'd rather--
-Shut up.

454
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:05,900
Forget her, OK?

455
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,000
How pretty.

456
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,400
What?

457
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,400
$390.

458
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,200
That's so expensive.

459
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,667
Oh, Yuri.

460
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,667
What are you up to?

461
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,300
-Ah...
-Yes?

462
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,500
Yep, I think this one suits you best.

463
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,834
-But--
-Don't you like it?

464
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:54,400
OK, then this is my Christmas present
to you.

465
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:55,734
Really?

466
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,600
No, I can't take this--

467
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,200
It's one of my old ones,
so don't worry about it.

468
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,900
Are you sure it's OK?

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,100
Uh-huh.

470
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,867
Now, as for the food, he likes meat.

471
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,500
But as for soup, he likes seafood.

472
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:27,900
He likes any kind of pasta.

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
I see...

474
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,100
The soup should be seafood.

475
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,300
OK, got it.

476
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh... but I'm not really...

477
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,600
There's no need to play dumb, Nao.

478
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:44,700
I can see you're in love.
It's written all over your face.

479
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:48,300
But what's the point
in admitting that I am?

480
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,900
Why do you say that?

481
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,700
You know what I'm talking about, Yuri.

482
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:55,600
You told me his heart isn't
so easily moved.

483
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,000
That's true.

484
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
but if he made you his girlfriend

485
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,667
that's exactly why he'd treat you
with very special care.

486
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:20,967
Hi.

487
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,000
Can you give Nao a message?

488
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,934
Tell her I'll come get her tomorrow,
Christmas Eve, just past noon.

489
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:37,000
Tomorrow, Christmas Eve?

490
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
That's right.

491
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Our families get together every year
on Christmas Eve.

492
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,600
But I've decided she and I would
spend it together this year.

493
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:50,367
I've decided
that's how it will be from now on.

494
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,500
Later.

495
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:23,100
Welcome home.

496
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,200
So, about tomorrow,
I was thinking of having dinner early.

497
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,800
Nah, I've got work tomorrow.

498
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,600
OK, then I'll have it ready
by six o'clock tomor...

499
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,000
What?

500
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Hey!

501
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,000
What did you just say?

502
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
I've got work tomorrow.

503
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,800
But... Why?

504
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,100
You already had something planned, right?

505
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:47,100
You should have told me
you were doing something with that senior.

506
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Senior? You mean Daichi?

507
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,300
I plan on turning down Daichi--

508
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
You celebrated with him every year, right?

509
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,000
There is no point for me
to go out of my way

510
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,667
and worry over you.

511
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,800
Worry over me?

512
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,700
You invited me out
because you were worried about me?

513
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,000
On top of faking like we're dating,
I've caused you other problems too.

514
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,300
What's that supposed to mean?
What makes you think you're responsible?

515
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,500
What? Weren't you panicking over it?

516
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:20,900
Along with that girl, Marina,

517
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,600
weren't you looking for a date
for Christmas Eve?

518
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:27,000
What? No, I wasn't.

519
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,567
Then...

520
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,000
why have you been coming home
so late recently?

521
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,734
Well...

522
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,300
Well what?

523
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I had work.

524
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,767
Work? Where?

525
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:55,367
At a cafe... near the station.

526
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,200
You look like you're lying.

527
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,667
I'm not.

528
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:02,200
Well, I don't really understand it,

529
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,667
but Christmas Eve is special to girls,
right?

530
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:07,834
You bet it is. It's very special.

531
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,900
It's a day you spend having fun
and eating cake

532
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:13,767
with the people who are special to you,
whether it's a sweetheart or family.

533
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,066
It can't be just anyone.
It matters who you spend it with.

534
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,000
Then... it must be nice having him around.

535
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, just forget it!

536
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:41,200
What's with her?

537
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,000
Dammit!

538
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,300
{\an8}<i>Let's ask these people.</i>

539
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
{\an8}<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

540
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,500
{\an8}<i>-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.</i>

541
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,200
<i>-You're all couples, right?
-Yes.</i>

542
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,900
<i>How sweet.
We asked people on the street</i>

543
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,200
<i>who they would be spending
Christmas Eve with.</i>

544
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,500
<i>The number one answer was,
of course, with a sweetheart.</i>

545
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,500
<i>More than 60 percent gave that answer.</i>

546
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:29,300
How pretty.

547
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
Uehara...

548
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,567
Daichi.

549
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:16,400
I heard your message turning me down,
but you sounded kind of depressed.

550
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:19,500
Oh, yeah... I'm sorry.

551
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:21,100
Did I cause you trouble?

552
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,867
No. Come on in.

553
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,767
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

554
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:35,900
<i>How about a delicious,</i>

555
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,700
-homemade Christmas cake?
-Please be careful with the box.

556
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Thank you very much.

557
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,767
Thank you very much.

558
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,200
Are you sure you want to work?
You had the day off.

559
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
Of course it's OK.

560
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,500
He wants to spend Christmas Eve
with someone that's special to him.

561
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:52,800
Isn't that right?

562
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,300
Who do you mean by "someone special"?

563
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,300
Oh.

564
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,667
How about a Christmas cake?

565
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:59,300
<i>It's very special.</i>

566
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,100
It's a day you spend having fun
and eating cake

567
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
with the people who are special to you,
whether it's a sweetheart or family.

568
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,700
It can't be just anyone.
It matters who you spend it with.

569
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,200
Sorry... that I'm not someone special.

570
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:18,900
I can't believe it.

571
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,667
Thirty-eight point five degrees?

572
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,400
How could you not notice?
You can be so dense sometimes.

573
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,000
I've really been pushing myself lately.

574
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:38,834
-Here.
-Thank you.

575
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:42,767
I'll make you some porridge,
but is there anything else you'd like?

576
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,400
A cake.

577
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:50,667
You can have cake
after you get over this cold.

578
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,800
I want to eat a nice, round cake.

579
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,700
The typical strawberry cake

580
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,500
that we always had at your house.

581
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:06,300
We'd all sit around it,
laughing and singing.

582
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,900
Thank you, Daichi.

583
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,500
Huh?

584
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,000
For spending it with me every year.

585
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Thanks to you,

586
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,467
I've never once felt lonely
on Christmas Eve.

587
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
Thank you.

588
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,700
One cake, please.

589
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:21,800
OK.

590
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:33,400
Nao says she wants to eat one...
like this.

591
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:39,400
That'll be $33.

592
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,400
I've always known pretty much everything
that Nao likes.

593
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,100
What?

594
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,967
On Christmas, she likes chicken
and potage soup.

595
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,000
She likes that really typical stuff.

596
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Why are you telling me this?

597
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,767
But today, she prepared rolled cabbage
and seafood soup.

598
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,500
Even though she's sick,
she went out of her way to make them.

599
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:09,934
What are you trying to tell me?

600
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,667
She's not the type to complain.

601
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,467
She never has been.

602
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:22,767
But she's got a fever now,
and said she's lonely.

603
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,200
Huh?

604
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,200
If you made her a promise,
then you'd better keep it.

605
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,667
<i>You're the greatest, Daichi.</i>

606
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,367
Open your eyes.

607
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Wow! It's a Hokkori Man sticker.

608
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,100
I thought you'd like it.

609
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,066
How did you know?

610
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,667
I just know.
I know everything you like, Nao.

611
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,934
You're the greatest, Daichi!

612
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,367
Nao. I'm coming in.

613
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,700
Uehara.

614
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,000
Lie back down.

615
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,700
What about your work?

616
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:19,967
I took off

617
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:21,967
after hearing what he had to say.

618
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,900
Who? Daichi?

619
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:29,000
Nao.

620
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,367
Yes?

621
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,100
I know you've got a fever now, but...

622
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:42,600
Huh?

623
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh... uh...

624
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,500
That's...

625
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,600
for my job... at the ramen shop.

626
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,000
Ramen shop?

627
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,967
You mean you weren't working
at a cafe near the station.

628
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,200
No.

629
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,900
Why did you make up such a stupid thing?

630
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,834
-I couldn't help it.
-Why?

631
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:19,867
Sometimes you don't want people
to see you looking a certain way.

632
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:21,000
Why?

633
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:25,200
If you saw me delivering ramen
when I was dressed like this,

634
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,000
you'd make fun of me.

635
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,100
Yeah, it is pretty awful looking.

636
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,100
That outfit...
isn't anything to brag about either.

637
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,367
What?

638
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,700
Stop laughing.

639
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:58,100
You're the only one
that I didn't want to see me like that.

640
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,100
Why?

641
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,467
I mean, we see each other every day.

642
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,567
I'm adding one more rule to the list.

643
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,400
Really?

644
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:16,500
Don't put on an act.
Lean on others when you need to.

645
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:22,500
I could have helped you
and prevented you from getting sick.

646
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,900
Who was it that collapsed the other day?

647
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,667
That's not important.
Are you going to follow the rules?

648
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,934
Yes.

649
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,500
Oh!

650
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,600
-Is that a cake?
-Yeah.

651
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:43,300
That's great. Can I look?

652
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:46,000
But no eating until your fever goes down.

653
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,200
OK.

654
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,400
Uh-oh.

655
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,734
Crap. I shouldn't have run.

656
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:02,867
Hey! Don't!

657
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,934
I said no eating.

658
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,400
See. I bet you're feeling sick now,
aren't you?

659
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,734
No. It's delicious.

660
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
But if he made you his girlfriend

661
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,400
that's exactly why he'd treat you
with very special care.

662
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,200
I'm fine with the way things are now.

663
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,100
Huh?

664
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,300
I'm fine just like this.

665
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,734
You can't stay like that.
Your fever's still super high.

666
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,600
You're right.

667
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,900
I'm going to have a taste of this.

668
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:00,400
Hey!

669
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Hey, Nao. I got some milk pudding.

670
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,400
<i>I'm feeling better,
so I'm going for a walk in the park.</i>

671
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,400
<i>Nao.</i>

672
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,066
What?

673
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,867
What did you want to see me for, Nao?

674
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,467
I thought I should tell you the truth,
Abe.

675
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,367
You mean, you want to date me?

676
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:06,400
It's just like you said.
Uehara and I aren't dating.

677
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,567
Really?

678
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:12,767
Uehara doesn't have any feelings for me.

679
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:13,934
Then, you mean...

680
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:15,500
But...

681
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:21,500
I like Uehara.

682
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,667
Huh?

683
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:35,000
I like... Uehara.

684
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,967
Oh!

685
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,600
THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
