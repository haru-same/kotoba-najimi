1
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:09,933
Kotoko!

2
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,667
-Hey!
-Kotoko?

3
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,267
Kotoko!

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,833
Are you all right?

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,267
Move!

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
What do you think you're doing?

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,300
I'm sure you're aware...

8
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,867
that she and I are married.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,267
Don't try...

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,267
anything with Kotoko.

11
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:58,467
I'd take better care of Kotoko than you.

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,400
I'd love her more than you.

13
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:12,933
Is that right?

14
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,633
And when I woke up,

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,833
there was Naoki,
so worried about me!

16
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,800
He's usually cool-headed,

17
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:45,800
but he looked at me so tenderly...

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
I should faint more often.

19
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,900
By the way, who's that hunk?

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,300
Hunk?

21
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:03,700
The one that carried you
to the health office.

22
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:05,900
Keita?

23
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:09,433
Keita Kamogari is a classmate.
Is he a hunk?

24
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:14,433
Naoki Irie may be the only man
in your heart...

25
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,333
but...

26
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:22,833
seeing how panicked Kamo--
Whatever his name is. --was,

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,033
I could have sworn
that he was in love with you.

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,433
A love triangle!

29
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,600
Keita? No way!

30
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,767
It would have been fun
to see him challenge Naoki.

31
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,300
Why would anyone fight over Kotoko?

32
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,900
Right?

33
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,233
Hey...

34
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,667
<i>One month later...</i>

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,800
<i>Our first summer break had begun.</i>

36
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,100
Hey!

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,600
You're finally up.

38
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,233
Come on.

39
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,200
He had to wake you up a dozen times.

40
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,000
Was I sleeping?

41
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,500
Calling, "Naoki...!" in your sleep.

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,400
You even dream about him, don't you?

43
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,600
It was just a dream.

44
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,300
Sorry! Sorry!

45
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:33,367
<i>We had to forgo our summer plans</i>

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>to work on our report every day.</i>

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,667
I'm exhausted.
Another day of hard labor.

48
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:49,400
While some of us were sleeping.

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,967
Now all we have to do is summarize

50
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,467
-our assigned sections.
-Okay.

51
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,100
So, is this the last time
we're working as a group?

52
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,167
Right.

53
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Oh...

54
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,800
Shall we go have some fun?

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,667
We worked on our report all summer.

56
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,067
Let's celebrate!

57
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,933
-Sounds good!
-Let's go!

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,333
It's decided, then.

59
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,633
How about you, Tomoko?

60
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,300
Sorry, but I have to work.

61
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,800
You're working part-time?

62
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,100
Where do you work? At a florist?

63
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,100
-A bakery?
-A restaurant?

64
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,500
In the food section
of a department store.

65
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,767
As a cashier?

66
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,933
At the fish market.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
How perfect.

68
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,000
No, nothing.

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,033
I'd better leave. Bye-bye.

70
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,967
-Bye.
-See you.

71
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,300
Shall we get going, too?

72
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,700
-I guess.
-Yes!

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,167
How about bowling?
I have my own ball.

74
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,333
His own ball?

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,567
I need to get cash from the ATM.

76
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,233
Wait, Moto-chan!

77
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,633
Meet you at the school gate.

78
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,900
-Okay!
-Right.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,367
Shall we go?

80
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,300
The gate is this way.

81
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,033
-This way?
-Yeah.

82
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:25,633
Mr. Irie.

83
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,433
We're going out for a bite after this.

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,933
Care to join us?

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,133
I'll pass.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,267
I knew it!

87
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,867
His wife is waiting for him
with a home-cooked meal.

88
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,467
I'm envious. It sure beats eating out.

89
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,567
I want a wife, too.

90
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,300
That's too bad. I wanted
to have a drink with you

91
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,400
and discuss molecular cell biology.

92
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,400
Speaking of cellular biology...

93
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:05,500
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

94
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,200
{\an8}You're on a roll, Kotoko.

95
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,933
{\an8}A GENIUS AND JEALOUSY

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,633
{\an8}I told you to leave it to me.

97
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,267
{\an8}-Here, Marina.
-Thanks.

98
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,667
Let's take a short break
before the next game.

99
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:18,633
Bring it on!

100
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,900
Teach me, too.

101
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,300
-Follow me.
-Okay.

102
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,467
Here.

103
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,300
Thanks.

104
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,700
I yelled so much, I feel refreshed.

105
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,833
Right?

106
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,800
You sound pretty frustrated.

107
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,700
Having problems with Naoki?

108
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,633
I wouldn't say that.

109
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,367
Well... maybe.

110
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:01,467
He's so busy nowadays.

111
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:05,067
I hardly see him at home.

112
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,167
But when I do see him...

113
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:13,133
I may be imagining it,
but he's kind of cold.

114
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,700
Your problem is...

115
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,833
you try too hard with him.

116
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,100
Loosen your shoulders. Relax.

117
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,700
You're hopeless.

118
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,533
I'll be your better half today, okay?

119
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't need your sympathy, Keita.

120
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,133
Just accept it graciously.

121
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
Thanks for treating today!

122
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,900
I can't believe we lost to you.

123
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,333
What a disgrace.

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,433
How about karaoke, then?

125
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Sounds good. A karaoke sing-off!

126
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,433
We'll win for sure this time.

127
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,733
I'd better get going.

128
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,133
Are you abandoning us?

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,100
I'm a housewife after all.

130
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,033
I'm not letting you leave!

131
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,533
No skipping out midway!

132
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
-Yeah!
-Let me go!

133
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:18,433
She needs to cook dinner for Mr. Irie.

134
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,733
That's exactly right. So, I need to go!

135
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,900
No! You need a break sometimes!

136
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:25,933
Hey!

137
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,667
The nursing group!

138
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:31,000
It's Mr. Irie!

139
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,267
It's Naoki!

140
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,867
Good evening!

141
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,833
What are you doing here, Naoki?

142
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,533
Dinner. With the guys.

143
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,500
I see.

144
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,433
Miss Marina. Fancy meeting you here.

145
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,167
We must be like eudiplozoon nipponicum.

146
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,700
Eudiplozoon...?

147
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,000
Twin parasites found on goldfish gills.

148
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:01,500
Once they find each other,
they're conjoined forever.

149
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,967
Isn't it romantic?

150
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,333
Aren't they a funny pair, Naoki?

151
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:10,867
Yeah.

152
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,933
Guess what? We just went bowling.

153
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:22,300
-Bowling?
-I did great for my first time!

154
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:26,133
I thought of you
and threw strike after strike!

155
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,600
I wish you could have seen me!

156
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,367
Irie, we'll be late. Let's go.

157
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,200
I have to go.

158
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,633
Hey!

159
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,733
If you have time to drink with them,
spend some time with your wife.

160
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,400
Wait a minute...

161
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,500
I know you're trying to impress Kotoko,

162
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:13,400
but I'm sick of your lecturing.

163
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:18,400
That's rude, Naoki.
Keita was just thinking of me!

164
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,133
He knew I was... feeling down...

165
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,300
Then why don't you go home
with Kamogari?

166
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:29,400
He seems so worried about you.

167
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,100
How mean.

168
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,133
Why would you say that? That's stupid!

169
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,300
Kotoko!

170
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,133
Aren't you going after her?

171
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,100
If you're not going after her, I will.

172
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,333
Keita! Wait!

173
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,667
Moto-chan! Wait!

174
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,500
Hurry up, Marina!

175
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:23,633
<i>I can't believe Naoki said that.</i>

176
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,733
<i>I just wanted to be with him.</i>

177
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,700
<i>Are you sick of me?</i>

178
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:41,900
-Hey!
-Nao--

179
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,900
It's not Naoki.

180
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,500
Sorry, Keita.

181
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,900
I know that was unpleasant.

182
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,367
All because of us...

183
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,633
It doesn't even concern you...

184
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,067
It does concern me.

185
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,500
Don't say that it doesn't.

186
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,767
You should...

187
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,033
leave him.

188
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,567
Ta-da!

189
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:45,433
I splurged and made sushi rice!

190
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,400
My favorite!

191
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,700
Looks delicious.

192
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:56,900
You could serve this at a restaurant.

193
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,467
I'm just an amateur.

194
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:03,167
I'm embarrassed to serve it to a pro...

195
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,533
Let's eat!

196
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,200
Bon appétit!

197
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:14,833
Please...

198
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,800
"Cut" me some cuttlefish, will you?

199
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,967
And what's this salmon-colored fish?

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,633
Salmon.

201
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,400
Correct!

202
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:36,800
This roe is so good,
I'd eat it twice in a "roe."

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,967
You got me on that one!

204
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,633
I'm done.

205
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,100
Already? Naoki...

206
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,967
I'm taking a bath and turning in.

207
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm done.

208
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:03,833
You, too, Kotoko?

209
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,667
I'm feeling a little tired.

210
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,533
Dad?

211
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,533
Can I use your library?

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,867
Of course you can.

213
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:20,933
I have a test right after the break.

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,200
Then study with Naoki.

215
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,767
But he's going to sleep.

216
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,800
Don't worry about him!

217
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't want to bother him.

218
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:37,167
I'll wash dishes later.

219
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,867
Something's wrong!
This has been going on for a while...

220
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,533
What shall we do?

221
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,700
It's only a matter of time
before they divorce.

222
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,900
Yuki! Don't say that!

223
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,200
It's natural for couples to fight.
Let's leave them alone.

224
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,367
The interbrain...

225
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,767
...bridge?

226
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,567
No, brain stem.

227
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,100
It's no use! I can't focus!

228
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:42,700
<i>I keep hearing Keita's voice.</i>

229
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,667
You should...

230
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,200
leave him.

231
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,733
You must be kidding, Keita!

232
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:00,933
You're always joking!

233
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't tease a married woman.

234
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,200
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

235
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,067
Thanks!

236
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:31,333
<i>We walked in total silence.</i>

237
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,933
<i>Whether he was joking or not,</i>

238
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,733
<i>I had never been held that way</i>
<i>by anyone other than Naoki.</i>

239
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,133
<i>I was panicked.</i>

240
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:48,300
<i>I haven't spoken to Naoki since.</i>

241
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,900
<i>I want to make up...</i>

242
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,767
<i>but he's avoiding me.</i>

243
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,167
It's no use thinking about it.

244
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,733
I'm going to sleep!

245
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,433
<i>He looks so sweet.</i>

246
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,333
<i>How did we end up like this?</i>

247
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:58,600
<i>You're right here,</i>
<i>but I can't even kiss you.</i>

248
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:07,600
<i>The long summer ended,</i>
<i>and a new semester began.</i>

249
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,433
Morning!

250
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,800
Oh, it's you.

251
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:26,833
Are you avoiding someone?

252
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,100
Not really, but...

253
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,667
Hey, Keita.

254
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,000
Long time, no see.

255
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,033
Yeah...

256
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,333
Kotoko.

257
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,133
Yes! What?

258
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,567
Did you...

259
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,900
summarize the section
on pathophysiology?

260
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,033
Pathophysiology?

261
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,967
Don't tell me you forgot.

262
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,133
That was your assigned section!

263
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,333
I'm sorry! Sorry...

264
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:10,233
<i>Thank God. He's the same old Keita.</i>

265
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,967
<i>He was joking that night after all.</i>

266
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,400
Calm down.

267
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,367
I'm sorry!

268
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,633
Naoki...

269
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:43,100
<i>I want to do well to impress Naoki.</i>

270
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,533
<i>So, we can make up.</i>

271
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,800
Okay...

272
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,667
EXAM DAY

273
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:22,300
You're leaving already, Naoki?

274
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,500
I have some research to do.

275
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,633
I'll rush and make you breakfast.

276
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,667
Don't bother.

277
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:33,433
But you don't look so hot...

278
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm going.

279
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
Good luck.

280
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,767
Begin now.

281
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,367
Stop.

282
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:23,233
<i>Before I knew it, exams were over.</i>

283
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,300
We're finally finished.

284
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm exhausted.

285
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,133
How did you do, Kotoko?

286
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,700
I feel pretty good about it.

287
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,000
Wow!

288
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,900
-Are you sure?
-Of course!

289
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,433
Miss Marina!

290
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,133
Miss Marina...

291
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,767
What do you want?

292
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,767
Do you remember our passionate vow?

293
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:55,900
Remind me.

294
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,500
If I beat Naoki Irie
and became Number 1,

295
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,633
you vowed to go out with me.

296
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,300
Were you serious?

297
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,833
I'm always serious.

298
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,800
I didn't go anywhere this summer.
All I did was study.

299
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:13,000
And how did your exams go?

300
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,567
Today's test...

301
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,500
was perfect! I just know it!

302
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,700
I'm 99.9 percent sure
that I beat Naoki Irie!

303
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:26,533
Excuse me!

304
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:31,800
Where is Mr. Irie?

305
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:37,300
Don't worry. Naoki won't lose.

306
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,733
Right?

307
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,367
I'm sure you're right, but...

308
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:49,733
let's go ask Mr. Irie
how he did on the test.

309
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,800
Let's go! Hurry!

310
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,800
You, too, Keita!

311
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,200
You're here, too?

312
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,333
Mr. Irie!

313
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,800
How did you do on the test?

314
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,133
Test?

315
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,067
Not good.

316
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,367
What?!

317
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,767
Impossible! You must be joking!

318
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:36,100
It was the worst I ever did.

319
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,900
I did it! I'm Number 1!

320
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,500
Miss Marina...

321
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,233
Is it true, Naoki?

322
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,133
Yeah.

323
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,667
Are you okay? Do you have a fever?

324
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,967
Forget it. I'm fine.

325
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,833
See you later.

326
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,833
I sense an awkward tension
between you two.

327
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,333
Did you have a fight?

328
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,567
No...

329
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,000
But he acts as if he doesn't like you.

330
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:54,467
No way! He's just a little tired!

331
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,367
Now that Marina is with Funatsu,

332
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,733
my rivals are dropping like flies.

333
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
He's just tired!

334
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,500
Calm down.

335
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,267
But...

336
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,100
Has it been this way for long?

337
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,133
It's been a month since that night.

338
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,733
Is it me?

339
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,033
No! It doesn't concern you at all.

340
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,700
I told you not to say that.

341
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,867
It concerns me.

342
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,300
But you were joking that night, right?

343
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,167
I wasn't joking.

344
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm serious about what I said.

345
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:44,933
Keita...?

346
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
That's how I feel.

347
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,567
You'll never be happy
with someone like him.

348
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:56,333
Get a divorce.

349
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,067
Kinnosuke, I'm done over here.

350
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:06,467
Let's close up, then.

351
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,567
Are you closed already?

352
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:10,867
Yup! Come again tomorrow.

353
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Irie!

354
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,667
Oh, Naoki!

355
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:18,167
What'll it be? Anything you want.

356
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,567
I'm the one who's cooking!

357
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,167
Something simple.

358
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,500
Fried chicken maybe?

359
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,733
That's not simple at all!

360
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,833
Kin-chan!

361
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,333
Coming right up.

362
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,933
Please wait a few minutes, Naoki.

363
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,067
Here you go.

364
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,933
Kinnosuke's cooking is the best!

365
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,667
Don't state the obvious.

366
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,400
It's good.

367
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,367
Right?

368
00:28:55,433 --> 00:29:00,067
Kinnosuke is working hard for me!

369
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,700
Whatever...

370
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,100
You get along so well.

371
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,800
Are you kidding? With her?

372
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:10,533
Of course!

373
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,200
You and Kotoko get along well, too.

374
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,800
I wonder...

375
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,267
But not lately.

376
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:26,900
What do you mean?
Are you making her cry again?

377
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:33,867
No... I think it's me.

378
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:39,733
What? Are you sick?
You're a doctor. Shape up.

379
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,833
No, I'm not sick.

380
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,033
I'm not sleeping well.

381
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,567
What is it, then? What's wrong?

382
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,167
I don't even know myself...

383
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,400
why I act the way I do towards Kotoko.

384
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,000
Ever since Keita Kamogari
has been hanging around Kotoko,

385
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:07,300
I feel so irritated every time I see her.

386
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:26,167
You really don't get it?

387
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,367
What?

388
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:33,900
Are you an idiot?
And you call yourself a genius.

389
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,833
You understand something that I don't?

390
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:42,567
You're jealous.

391
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,133
It's just plain jealousy.

392
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:52,600
Me? Jealous?

393
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,333
No way. I'm not you.

394
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,167
Idiot. I'm telling you!

395
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:05,267
Listen. Thanks to you...

396
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,633
I'm a six-year veteran of "jealousy."

397
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,833
And as a veteran, I can vouch for it.

398
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,467
You are jealous of Kotoko

399
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,567
and what's his name!

400
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,533
Even a genius gets jealous.

401
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,467
So, tell me,

402
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,500
who's this fool hanging around Kotoko?

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,600
I think he needs some discipline.

404
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:42,900
Kinnosuke!
You can be jealous of me, too!

405
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,567
You idiot!

406
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,667
Jealous, Kin-chan?

407
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:48,600
Are you kidding me?

408
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:59,767
<i>People are starting</i>
<i>to dress for cooler weather.</i>

409
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,333
<i>But Naoki and I still haven't</i>
<i>gotten past our summer...</i>

410
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,067
Naoki...

411
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,433
How did you do on your test, Kotoko?

412
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,667
You were super confident.

413
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,733
Stop stalling and show us!

414
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:58,833
What? Fifty-one points, 36 points,

415
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,300
48 points, 43-point average?!

416
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,600
Cut it out.

417
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,600
We're just having fun.

418
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:08,667
Here.

419
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,300
Thanks, Keita.

420
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,700
You...!

421
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,800
How could you be confident
with test scores like that?

422
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,933
You think you can become a nurse
with scores like that?!

423
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,933
I'm sorry!

424
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:31,333
I'm sorry...

425
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:35,333
I'm scared!

426
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,900
Maybe I'll go to the shrine to pray.

427
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:48,700
Nothing's working out for me lately.

428
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,033
You still haven't made up with Naoki?

429
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,000
No.

430
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:57,267
I thought I'd get good grades
on my tests

431
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:01,500
so I could impress Naoki
and we could make up.

432
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,633
But it didn't happen.

433
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,967
You need an excuse...

434
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,000
What should she do
in this situation, Satomi?

435
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:19,767
Are you all right?
Did you eat too much cake?

436
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,600
Are you... pregnant?

437
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,567
I am.

438
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,200
I think...

439
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,700
I'm pregnant.

440
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,533
What?!

441
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,467
I took a home pregnancy test.

442
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:42,200
What are you going to do?!

443
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,467
Does Ryo know?

444
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:47,467
Yeah.

445
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:49,067
What did he say?

446
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:52,700
"Let's get married."

447
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,767
What? Married?!

448
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,900
He wants me to have the baby.

449
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,900
I should get married first, but...

450
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,333
It's common nowadays!

451
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:09,233
Congratulations, Satomi!

452
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,200
Congratulations.

453
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:14,800
Thanks!

454
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,733
So, when is the wedding?

455
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,933
Once the pregnancy has stabilized.

456
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,633
Satomi... a mom.

457
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:31,133
You should hurry up
and make up with Naoki

458
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,300
and make a baby, too!

459
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,400
I want you both to come
to my wedding!

460
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,767
Yeah... I guess.

461
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,433
Oh, my! Satomi?

462
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,267
How nice! A wedding and a baby!

463
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,633
We have to celebrate.

464
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,900
She's due around June next year.

465
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,533
My goodness.

466
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,433
I'm sure it'll be a cute girl,
just like Satomi.

467
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,633
I wish you and Naoki would...

468
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:13,600
Just wishful thinking.

469
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,767
<i>I'm sure mom really wants</i>
<i>a grandchild...</i>

470
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:25,833
<i>but we haven't even kissed lately.</i>

471
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,800
They say that happiness is infectious.

472
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:40,133
I'm sure something good
will happen to you soon.

473
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,100
Mom...

474
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,100
Thank you.

475
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,967
I can do this.

476
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,467
Naoki... can I talk to you?

477
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:18,267
What?

478
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,233
I have some good news.

479
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:36,300
Satomi is going to marry Ryo!

480
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:40,067
And she's pregnant.

481
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,967
That's nice.

482
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,067
And...

483
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:56,500
she plans to get married
after her first trimester.

484
00:37:57,267 --> 00:38:00,767
She wants us to attend
her wedding together.

485
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,033
Yeah.

486
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:11,333
I wonder how Satomi's wedding will be.

487
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,733
I can't wait.

488
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
I wore a wedding dress, but Satomi
would look good in a kimono, too.

489
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:22,800
I love weddings!

490
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,467
I wouldn't mind getting married
all over again!

491
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:33,167
I'd love to have another wedding.

492
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,333
Just kidding.

493
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,200
Is that all?

494
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,467
Sorry to disturb your studies.

495
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:07,533
Kotoko?

496
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:15,633
-You!
-What's wrong with you?

497
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,133
You! You!

498
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,033
Hey! Kotoko!

499
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,633
Stop! What are you doing?

500
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,100
This is all wrong!

501
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,533
This isn't how it should be!

502
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,167
I hate this.

503
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,500
I can't stand it!
You don't even look at me!

504
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:35,967
You don't care about me at all.

505
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,233
You don't care what I do!

506
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:42,933
Keita told me he loved me!

507
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,033
He told me to leave you.

508
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:51,300
You don't love me anymore, do you?

509
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,000
That's not it...

510
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:57,367
You never loved me!

511
00:39:57,433 --> 00:40:00,267
-Calm down!
-No! Why...?

512
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:02,333
Why...

513
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,867
...did you marry me?

514
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:15,267
I'm the only one... that loves you.

515
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:18,200
I can't do this!

516
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:20,200
Kotoko!

517
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,933
What happened, Kotoko?
Where are you going?

518
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:30,433
Kotoko!

519
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:59,133
<i>I was always too scared to ask him.</i>

520
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:05,400
<i>But the question was always</i>
<i>in my heart, and I finally said it.</i>

521
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,333
<i>I put an end to it myself.</i>

522
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:25,667
<i>Are we... finished?</i>

523
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,400
Want to come live with me?

You'll have to retake the test.

526
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:03,633
Why do you want to become a nurse?

527
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,500
To support the doctors

528
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:10,967
and dedicate ourselves
to people in our care.

529
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:12,467
You're a man...?

530
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:13,733
Forget it!
