1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,400
That girl.

2
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:34,900
I've seen you here before...

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm sorry. I...

4
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:44,200
That uniform...
Do you go to Tonan Middle School?

5
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,233
You must be Yuki's friend!

6
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm sorry!

7
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:53,733
Wait!

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,833
You like Yuki, don't you?

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,033
What?!

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,533
You're in Class F?

11
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:18,067
I'm not that good at studying.

12
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:24,233
I want to be in Yuki's class
so I try to aim for Class A, but...

13
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,067
I know!

14
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:32,233
I was the same! I was in Class F!

15
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:36,533
-You were in Class F, too?
-Yes!

16
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:41,767
I was in Class F.
The class for all the flunkies at Tonan!

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,433
We're like sisters!

18
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,200
How embarrassing.

19
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:53,367
Wait. But you--
You married Yuki's older brother.

20
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, that's right.

21
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,867
How did you manage that?

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,467
I heard Yuki's brother is a genius, too.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,967
And he hates girls.

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,200
I can't recall exactly what clinched it...

25
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,333
but after confessing my love,
I pushed and pushed

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,333
for four years straight!

27
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,900
So, it's tenacity. But can I do it?

28
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,100
What do you like about Yuki?

29
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,267
What do I like? Well...

30
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:35,167
He's super smart.

31
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,033
And those cool eyes.

32
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,133
His face is so handsome.

33
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,500
His height... Well, he'll grow.

34
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,900
Stupid.

35
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:01,967
So that's how you see him.

36
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,700
I guess love is blind.

37
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,233
No, nothing.

38
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,433
Have you tried to approach him?

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,033
I've never even talked to him.

40
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,600
Never?

41
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,867
He doesn't even know I exist.

42
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,233
He's in Class A. I'm in Class F.

43
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:35,300
We're not that far apart in distance...

44
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:42,600
but... in my heart,
it feels like a gulf divides us.

45
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,000
I know exactly how you feel!

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,167
It's like I'm looking at my old self.

47
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,400
My sister.

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,533
Yuki has a rotten personality,
but I'm rooting for you!

49
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,367
Let's make your dream come true!

50
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,067
-But...
-Don't worry.

51
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:19,133
Yuki's brother said
he didn't like stupid girls,

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,967
but we're married now!

53
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,633
Leave it to me, okay?

54
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,400
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

55
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:45,033
What, Kotoko? Don't bother me.

56
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,700
Was I bothering you?

57
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:51,833
Why are you sitting there
and following me around like a zombie?

58
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,133
A zombie?

59
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,133
Oh, a thread.

60
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,567
Go away. Leave me alone.

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,200
<i>He's so guarded, as usual.</i>

62
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,933
Do you know Konomi Sagawa?

63
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,467
Konomi Sagawa?

64
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,900
She's the niece of a friend of a friend.

65
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,100
She goes to Tonan Middle School.

66
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,600
The niece of a friend of a friend?

67
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,267
I heard she's adorable.

68
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,833
I think she's in your grade.

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,633
Don't know her.

70
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,133
You don't?

71
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,067
There's no one like that in my class.

72
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,900
I don't know any girls outside of Class A.

73
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,100
<i>That's so Yuki.</i>

74
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:50,333
Okay, okay, okay then.

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,333
Is there a girl you like, Yuki?

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,600
-What?
-A girl!

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,367
-Are you interested in girls?
-No!

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,767
So, there's isn't one you like
at this moment, right?

79
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,533
Looking at you...

80
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:15,633
my interest in girls totally fades away.

81
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,733
He isn't interested in any girl right now.

82
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,567
-Send!
-Hey!

83
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,467
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,900
{\an8}NAOKI, COUNTING ON YOU FOR KOTOKO!

85
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,600
{\an8}-Eat up now.
-Get off of me.

86
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,500
Naoki, your dinner's coming right up.

87
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,967
Here you go.

88
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:37,033
I went to see Satomi's newborn baby today.

89
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,667
-Really?
-Satomi's baby?

90
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,333
How was she? Is Satomi okay?

91
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,367
She's a healthy mom.

92
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,800
The baby was so cute. Look!

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,433
She looks just like Satomi!

94
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,633
She was so cute, I cried.

95
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,000
She's cute all right.

96
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,100
Are you crying, Dad?

97
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,967
Are you kidding? No!

98
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:07,933
Mr. Aihara?

99
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,533
I've known Satomi and Jinko
since they were little.

100
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,933
They're like daughters to me.

101
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,367
Dad.

102
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,800
What will happen when Kotoko has a baby?

103
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:25,667
Kotoko's baby would be cute beyond belief!

104
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,767
Kotoko's baby.

105
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,233
Mr. Aihara!

106
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,400
I just remembered
when she was a little baby.

107
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,667
How was Kotoko when she was a baby?

108
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,800
She cried all day.

109
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,200
Etsuko and I didn't know what to do.

110
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:52,100
Then she'd stop all of a sudden
and we'd panic, thinking she was dead.

111
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,233
So, what happened?

112
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,567
You were just sleeping.

113
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,600
She hasn't changed much.

114
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,900
I guess.

115
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,333
No progress.

116
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,600
Yuki!

117
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,233
I've never seen a photo
of Kotoko as a child.

118
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,400
Our house was destroyed.

119
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,867
By the meteor shower?

120
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,133
We don't know where anything went.

121
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,433
That's right. How tragic.

122
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,500
I don't know how I looked
when I was a baby,

123
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,967
but Dad says I looked exactly like I did
when I was a kid.

124
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,567
You're so cute.

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,100
You mean immature.

126
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,833
I don't know anything
about your mom, either.

127
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,967
I see.

128
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:44,500
We have no old pictures left.

129
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:48,367
Etsuko was a very cute person.

130
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,267
Please, stop it.

131
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,267
Well, she was to me.

132
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,267
She was Miss Akita-Komachi, right?

133
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,033
Miss Akita-Komachi?

134
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,467
-That's what I heard.
-And she looked a lot like me, right?

135
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,967
I don't remember much,
but she was gentle and refined

136
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,067
and quite beautiful.

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,400
And she looked a lot like you?

138
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,567
Dad... next week is the anniversary
of Kotoko's mother's death.

139
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,167
Oh, yeah.

140
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,200
How did you know, Naoki?

141
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,800
You used to visit her grave
about this time every year.

142
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,300
That's right.

143
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:32,300
How long has it been
since she passed away?

144
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,800
Kotoko was in first grade then, so...

145
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,733
it's been 18 years.

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,867
Has it been that long?

147
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:45,233
Kotoko and I will go again this year, too.

148
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,600
I'll go with you.

149
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,667
-What?
-What?

150
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,367
I've been thinking
I should go pay my respects.

151
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,933
But it's super far
and there's nothing interesting there.

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,700
And you have lots of work to do.

153
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:04,767
-I'm grateful you even thought about it.
-You don't have to put yourself out!

154
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm not. I happen to be free
around the time.

155
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,800
And your family is from Akita.

156
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,100
The bullet train goes there. Don't worry.

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,833
But...

158
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,767
I want to see her pictures, too.

159
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,733
Miss Akita-Komachi.

160
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
Rain doesn't seems to go away.

161
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:43,233
Kotoko's mom loved rain.

162
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,200
It will take 30 minutes on the next bus.

163
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,633
Naoki...

164
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,633
why won't we just go visit her grave
and head back home?

165
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,633
We can visit her family next time.

166
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,933
It wouldn't be nice to visit them
after getting wet like this.

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,967
That's a great idea, Dad.

168
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,333
Let's stop by a hot spring
and eat something warm.

169
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,533
That's not possible.

170
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,700
My mom already called your family.

171
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,867
She told them that we were coming.

172
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,033
You must be hiding something.

173
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:37,267
It can't be helped. I give up.

174
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,900
Give up?

175
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,467
You'll understand when you get there.

176
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,400
How do we get there? By taxi?

177
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,033
Well...

178
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,600
How do we get...?

179
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:05,967
It's Kotoko!

180
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:14,467
Welcome, Naoki!

181
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,033
Thank you for coming!

182
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,133
It's a pleasure to meet you.

183
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,633
It's been a while, Kotoko, Shigeo!

184
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,067
I'm Uncle Tsuruzo,
Kotoko's mother's brother.

185
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,367
Come this way!

186
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:45,900
Come on, this way. Hurry, hurry!

187
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,500
Okay now.

188
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,000
Miss Kumashiro will present
a bouquet of flowers.

189
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,633
A bouquet of flowers!

190
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,233
Welcome to Kumashiro.

191
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,167
Thank you.

192
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I remember Kotoko
when she could barely walk.

193
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,333
She's all grown up now.

194
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,800
Naoki is super smart.

195
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,233
He's going to be a doctor.

196
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:50,767
Please, give us a few words. Come on.

197
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,900
Uncle.

198
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,067
Never mind. Come on!

199
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,733
Sorry.

200
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,567
How do you do? I'm Naoki Irie.

201
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,067
Thank you for this unbelievable reception.

202
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,767
You're welcome.

203
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:17,700
But my name is misspelled.

204
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,233
-What?
-Oh, no.

205
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,600
-Who wrote that?
-Why didn't you check?

206
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:27,267
And plus, the word "welcome"
is also misspelled.

207
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,700
-He's right!
-Oh, my God!

208
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,000
There's one extra stroke.

209
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:38,300
What a smart husband!

210
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:43,133
Kotoko... he's too good for you!

211
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
You got a good one!

212
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,633
We'll take you home now. Come on.

213
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,367
Uncle Tsuruzo. Thanks for everything,
but we'll just go to the grave and--

214
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,600
What are you talking about, Shigeo?

215
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,533
If I don't bring Naoki home

216
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,267
Etsuko will turn into a mokko
and haunt us!

217
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,533
"Mokko?"

218
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,467
It means "a ghost."

219
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,000
Come on. Get in the car. Get in.

220
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,300
Get in, get in.

221
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,167
My niece brought her husband
from Tokyo.

222
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,567
We're having a party tonight.
Come over and drink.

223
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,133
-Sure!
-Come on over.

224
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,367
Why are my relatives always like this?

225
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,367
He'll hear you.

226
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:46,233
It's embarrassing in front of Naoki.

227
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,667
What's with this van?
It's like an election van.

228
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:56,000
And why is Miss Kumashiro sitting up front
and we're--?

229
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,167
I'm used to it already.

230
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,933
Sorry, Naoki.

231
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:10,433
Kotoko's mom's side of the family
loves festivities and loud parties.

232
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,233
Not me, though.

233
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm still not used to it.

234
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:20,567
That's why we always try
to visit her grave silently.

235
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,333
Did you also receive
a welcome like this before?

236
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,233
Yes! Yes, I did!

237
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:31,333
I left Saga for Tokyo
where I met and married her mom.

238
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,567
I was shocked when I first met her family.

239
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,467
I know what you mean.

240
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,200
But you did great today.

241
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,600
I was too nervous,
and I don't even wanna think about it.

242
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:44,433
Well...

243
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,500
You're the only who knows how I feel.

244
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:54,167
Naoki... we're comrades!

245
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,733
I'd rather not be.

246
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,600
Maybe right.

247
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,500
<i>He found out...</i>
<i>about my embarrassing family!</i>

248
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,233
<i>I didn't want him to know.</i>

249
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,833
<i>Please, don't let things get any worse.</i>

250
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:26,667
One, two, three!

251
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,133
Come on. Drink up.

252
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm glad you came, Naoki.

253
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,300
Thanks.

254
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,400
It's been so long, Miharu.

255
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,133
Kotoko, it's Hidemi.

256
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, is it?

257
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,633
Not again. There is no "Miharu."

258
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,000
Really?

259
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:02,800
Kotoko, you were never good
at remembering things.

260
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,867
Stop it!

261
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:08,633
When we went to the zoo,
you mistook your own child for another

262
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,100
and brought a complete stranger home!

263
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:15,900
Is that all you remember?

264
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:20,100
That was his fault.
He didn't say anything.

265
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,667
The kid's fault? You were so careless!

266
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,933
Their arguments are so senseless.

267
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,967
That hurts!

268
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,167
Hey!

269
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,800
What are you guys doing?

270
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:39,833
That's the guy who created Koto-rin.

271
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,967
He's famous!

272
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,333
Can we have your autograph?

273
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,567
Hey! Naoki isn't a celebrity!

274
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,433
Excuse us.

275
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
May we join you?

276
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,167
The ladies from Kumashiro Senior Club!

277
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Look how handsome!

278
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:12,000
You're Kotoko's husband?

279
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,133
Yes.

280
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
He's so good looking!

281
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:18,033
My throat hurts. Can you take a look?

282
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,067
Me, too.

283
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:30,533
Since I saw you for the first time,
my heart is beating hard!

284
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,767
This must mean something!

285
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,533
I'm first.

286
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,033
No. Me!

287
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,500
I'm first!

288
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,100
Hey!

289
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,867
Here you go. Etsuko's photo album.

290
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,367
Let me see!

291
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,700
This is from her school days.

292
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,533
I've never seen these, either.

293
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,633
What? Mom?

294
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,467
They used to stop at a snack shop
after school.

295
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,867
She really loved those octopus balls.

296
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,433
She looks just like you.

297
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,933
She had a beauty mark here.

298
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,467
What?

299
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,433
She didn't have a beauty mark.

300
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,200
But look.

301
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,333
Look again. That's seaweed.

302
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,467
-What?
-Seaweed?

303
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:38,267
How silly of her.

304
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,300
Right?

305
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,067
Mom.

306
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,633
Why are all these pictures...?

307
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,167
I don't even know.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,733
These ones are a little better.

309
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,600
What?! Miss Tonburi?

310
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:29,833
MOUNTAIN CAVIAR

311
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,067
What is this?

312
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,800
You said she was Miss Akita-Komachi.

313
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,200
That's what dad said.

314
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,733
That's what Mom told me.

315
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,200
But I guess she was Miss Tonburi.

316
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,533
But in reality,

317
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,767
I'm sure she was beautiful, gentle,
classy, and intelligent!

318
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,200
She must have been.

319
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:00,400
Etsuko was intelligent? Classy?

320
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,900
Are you kidding?

321
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,067
Uncle?

322
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,233
Etsuko was always fidgety,

323
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,133
and closer to the bottom of the class.

324
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,033
She wasn't athletic at all!

325
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,400
Mom.

326
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:22,800
She was in love with a boy
from the next village.

327
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:26,367
She waited for him in the snow
and almost froze to death.

328
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,833
She created a sensation in the village.

329
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,867
Froze to death?

330
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,800
She was found half buried in snow!

331
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
<i>I've never seen Naoki laugh so hard.</i>

332
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,867
I can't breathe.

333
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,833
She's unbelievably identical to you.

334
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,900
Her look and even personality.

335
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,933
Everyone in this village is like that.

336
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,133
I'm going to sleep!

337
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,433
We're going to the graveyard
in the morning.

338
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,533
I know!

339
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,667
Come on, Naoki. Let's drink!

340
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:11,767
Thank you.

341
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,633
Naoki.

342
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,767
How long has it been
since you first visited here?

343
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,267
Let's see.

344
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,933
The first time I visited here was...

345
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:02,100
about 25 years ago.
But I didn't visit them every year.

346
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,933
That's good enough.

347
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,433
Thank you.

348
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:14,500
So, you met her when you were about 20?

349
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:20,667
It was when
I was still training as a cook.

350
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,767
She was 19 years old.

351
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,100
We were both new to Tokyo.

352
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,767
I was walking in the city
when a girl fainted in front of me.

353
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,000
That's something.

354
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,600
I ran over and asked what was wrong.

355
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,867
She hadn't eaten in three days.

356
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,967
-Right on the street?
-Yeah.

357
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,767
What if I hadn't been there?

358
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:54,500
In any case, I thought she'd better eat,
so I made something for her.

359
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,800
She wolfed down four cups of rice.

360
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,633
That's amazing.

361
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,633
She must have been hungry.

362
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,433
Your cooking must have tasted
so good to her.

363
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:09,567
I hope so.

364
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:17,833
But she was the first one
who ate my cooking with such gusto.

365
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:23,500
She looked really good having my food.

366
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:29,267
Then she started coming
to my restaurant every day...

367
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,333
eating the least expensive thing.

368
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,900
She always sat right in front of me.

369
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,333
Before I knew it...

370
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,267
She's Kotoko's mom, all right.

371
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:51,200
Right! She loves good food...
but she can't cook worth a damn.

372
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,967
How can she be such a bad cook?

373
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,200
That's like Kotoko, too.

374
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:04,100
I started feeling like it was my duty
to feed her good food.

375
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,033
So, you fell in love with her appetite.

376
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:10,867
Maybe so.

377
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:13,767
Naoki...

378
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,867
don't tell Kotoko, okay?

379
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:18,633
Really?

380
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,667
It's embarrassing.

381
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,300
No, but...

382
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,967
Miss Akita-Komachi turned out
to be Miss Tonburi.

383
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,567
What a difference.

384
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:33,700
It sure is.

385
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,800
Akita-Komachi sounds
a little glamorous but...

386
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,233
"Tonburi" is a mountain vegetable.

387
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,600
Why did she have to lie?

388
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,833
She was quite cunning.

389
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,633
She sure fooled me.

390
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,933
Mom...

391
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,367
Mom...

392
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:19,833
Did you...

393
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,233
fall asleep looking up
at this ceiling, too?

394
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:36,733
<i>I didn't know anything about my mom.</i>

395
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,500
<i>The mom I fabricated from a few memories</i>

396
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,900
<i>and my real mom were pretty different.</i>

397
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:48,633
<i>But somehow, I feel closer to you now.</i>

398
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,733
<i>It's strange.</i>

399
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,433
<i>Naoki was really thinking about my mom.</i>

400
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:18,733
<i>I was always embarrassed...</i>
<i>and held back from talking about her.</i>

401
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,167
<i>I wonder why.</i>

402
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:23,633
<i>It's strange...</i>

403
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,733
<i>but... he made me so happy.</i>

404
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:28,933
Naoki.

405
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,033
What does
"strangle with a silk rope" mean?

406
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:37,267
Silk is fine and soft,
but very strong as well.

407
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:41,033
It means to hurt someone slowly
and indirectly.

408
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:46,033
Slowly and indirectly, huh?

409
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:49,800
Mr. Koto-rin, I don't get this.

410
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,033
That's easy to solve
using the quadratic formula.

411
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,500
Wow, you're so smart.

412
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,667
Just remember the formula. It's easy.

413
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,067
Mr. Koto-rin, how do you read this?

414
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,100
The "old bamboo cutter."

415
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,700
I see.

416
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,167
Old bamboo cutter!

417
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,467
Mr. Koto-rin, what goes here?

418
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:19,900
"From."

419
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,400
What? Come again?

420
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:25,367
Cheese is made from milk, so...

421
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:30,100
"Cheese is... made... from milk."

422
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,367
Milk, not "miluk."

423
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,633
Milk.

424
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,300
Milk.

425
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:40,100
Naoki!

426
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,400
Hey, hey, hey.
What is this, a private school?

427
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:51,300
Naoki, what does "a bad wife brings
a lifetime of misfortune" mean?

428
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,067
A wife that doesn't support her husband
will make him suffer forever.

429
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,000
I see.

430
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:03,067
What are you asking him, Miharu?!
A bad wife?!

431
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:07,333
I'm Hidemi!
Don't keep making the same mistake!

432
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,800
Is that right?

433
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,500
Naoki, can we go pick flowers later?

434
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:15,300
Sure.

435
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,667
Let's play with my cars!

436
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,500
No, let's go catch bugs!

437
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:19,967
Let's play soccer!

438
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,033
Mechanical cars.

439
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,100
Soccer!

440
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:28,233
We have to go to the graveyard!

441
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,400
Naoki!

442
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,700
These old folks in the village...

443
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:37,867
wondered if you can take a look
at their aches and pains.

444
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,000
Of course.

445
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,567
Naoki.

446
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,433
Sit down right here.

447
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:55,900
There's a clinic over there!

448
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,100
You're all taking him for granted!

449
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:08,367
My God! Look how late it is!

450
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,033
We should have gone to the grave
in the morning.

451
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:21,500
Kotoko, you're quite old-fashioned.

452
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:26,167
That's common sense!

453
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:27,567
Come on, Kotoko.

454
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,267
I never thought I'd hear you
talk about common sense.

455
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,900
You make me sound like
I have no common sense.

456
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,533
Never mind. It's okay.

457
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:41,933
We've gone to the graveyard
in the afternoon,

458
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,633
and we weren't cursed.

459
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,933
Etsuko won't mind.

460
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,667
-That's right.
-You're right.

461
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,567
I've been meaning to say something.

462
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,167
Why are you all following us?

463
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:03,800
Why are we following you?

464
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:07,000
We want to visit the grave
with your husband.

465
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,533
We all want to go.

466
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,567
This is the first time
Naoki is meeting my mom!

467
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:17,833
It's a very important day for me!

468
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:24,167
Naoki didn't come here
to take care of all of you!

469
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,200
Hey, Kotoko.

470
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:33,067
I thought... Naoki came to see my mom.

471
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:41,100
You're absolutely right, Kotoko.

472
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,933
We were so happy Naoki came.

473
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,967
I think there's too much of us for you.

474
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:49,700
Sorry.

475
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,800
Go take your time with Etsuko.

476
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,267
Sorry, Kotoko.

477
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,867
Let's go home.

478
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,067
We'll leave you here then.

479
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm very sorry.

480
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:15,567
Your relatives...

481
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,133
are so easy to please...

482
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
and meddlesome and star-struck.

483
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:24,833
Right?

484
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,167
Sorry, Naoki. I'm really sorry.

485
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,567
They're just like you.

486
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,667
Just like me?

487
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,100
So...

488
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:38,867
it's never boring.

489
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,233
I... kind of like them.

490
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Go call them back.

491
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:55,000
Let's visit your mom together.

492
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,167
We're almost there, Naoki.

493
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:11,500
My mom's grave is right over there.

494
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,433
That's quite a marker.

495
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,933
ETSUKO AIHARA'S GRAVEYARD IS THAT WAY

496
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,333
What is this?

497
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:28,833
What?

498
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:35,833
What is this?

499
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,367
We made it easy to find!

500
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,500
Easy to find?

501
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:44,300
We've been here dozens of times!

502
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:49,333
Not for you. For Naoki.

503
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,333
Yep.

504
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,733
Etsuko loved festivities.

505
00:37:55,267 --> 00:37:56,267
Thank you.

506
00:37:56,767 --> 00:38:01,467
I was able to spot Kotoko's mother's grave
straight away.

507
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,100
You're welcome!

508
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:11,333
Now that we found it,
can we clean it up a little?

509
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,800
-I guess.
-Go ahead.

510
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,233
We have to pour water over the stone.

511
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,267
Let's take it down.

512
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,467
I'm sorry, after all your hard work.

513
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,700
It's stuck on pretty good.

514
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,967
Etsuko was supposed to be in my grave...

515
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:46,933
but she went so early.

516
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,033
I thought she'd feel better
near her parents...

517
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,467
so I bought a family plot here.

518
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:55,633
I see.

519
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,633
When I die, I'll join Etsuko in here.

520
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:04,633
So, please, let Kotoko join you in yours.

521
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,567
Yes.

522
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,467
Etsuko...

523
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,633
Kotoko's husband is here to visit you.

524
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:21,100
He's almost too good for her.

525
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:23,900
Don't get any ideas, Etsuko.

526
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:36,167
I appreciate the gesture,
but don't do this anymore.

527
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:37,567
All right!

528
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,767
-Really?
-Got it!

529
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,600
You...

530
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,367
<i>Mom...</i>

531
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:10,900
<i>this is my husband, Naoki.</i>

532
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,433
<i>He came to meet you today.</i>

533
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,033
<i>Handsome, right?</i>

534
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,067
<i>He's the love...</i>

535
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,967
<i>of my life.</i>

536
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:35,100
Naoki.

537
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,500
What?

538
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,867
What were you praying for
at my mom's grave?

539
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,500
It's a secret between us.

540
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:56,200
-What?
-Nothing.

541
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,467
You're so strange.

542
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,700
Let's go buy stuff
to take home for everyone in Tokyo.

543
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,533
You love to shop, don't you?

544
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,833
What should we get?

545
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,533
Mountain caviar, of course.

546
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:14,967
Naoki!

547
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,867
<i>How do you do, Naoki?</i>

548
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,067
<i>Please take care...</i>

549
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,933
<i>of my Kotoko.</i>

550
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,400
NEXT EPISODE: "KISS OF GOODBYE"

551
00:42:56,467 --> 00:42:58,633
Yuki, this is your chance at love!

552
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,533
I want to be your friend!

553
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,033
Make the top 100 on the upcoming test.

554
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,767
That sounds familiar.

555
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,667
Stop fooling me around!
You all make me sick!

556
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:10,967
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,733
<i>Well, what shall I do?</i>

558
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,033
I'm thinking of working
at a hospital in Kobe.

559
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,667
You wouldn't understand.

560
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,200
Because...

561
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,033
{\an8}I...

562
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,333
