1
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:19,400
Naoki.

2
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:33,267
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,000
He's gone.

4
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:45,467
<i>How are you, Naoki?</i>

5
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:51,633
<i>Have you adjusted to life in Kobe?</i>

6
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,900
Congratulations, Naoki!

7
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:02,600
<i>You passed the National Medical</i>
<i>Practitioner's Qualifying Exam.</i>

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,367
It's not a bad offer. Think about it.

9
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,933
I'm thinking of working
at a hospital in Kobe.

10
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,600
You should stay.

11
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,867
I'll go on my own.

12
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:20,867
You should stay here
and continue your studies.

13
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:22,600
I...

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,333
I'll become a nurse in one year.

15
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,033
Then I'll come to Kobe.

16
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,533
I promise!

17
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,500
So...

18
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:37,967
Wait for me.

19
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,233
You can do it, Naoki!

20
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:08,600
<i>It's been 2 months since</i>
<i>you left for Kobe alone.</i>

21
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,067
You can do it, Kotoko.

22
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,333
We...

23
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,433
can do it.

24
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,633
<i>I...</i>

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
<i>I...</i>

26
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,900
don't think...

27
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,633
I can make it.

28
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,433
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
{\an8}...AND LOVE IN KOBE

30
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,967
{\an8}You've really been spacing out lately.

31
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:30,667
{\an8}Way more than usual, to be exact.

32
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,533
Are you and Naoki all right?

33
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,633
We're doing great!

34
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,467
Of course we are.

35
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,733
She's getting teary-eyed!

36
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,333
This is pretty severe.

37
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,667
Why don't you just go see him?

38
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:52,400
Or else we'll be the ones to suffer!

39
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:57,067
I'm fine! Naoki and I
share a strong marital bond.

40
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:01,500
Without their wives around,
men feel like they're single again,

41
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,733
and spread their wings.

42
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:07,033
He is a man, after all.

43
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,633
If a beautiful nurse or patient
made a move on him

44
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,333
he probably wouldn't mind.

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,633
If you won't go to Kobe

46
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,133
maybe I should go and make a move.

47
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,133
Don't say that.

48
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,300
I said, we're fine!

49
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,567
They're terrible! All terrible.

50
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:37,900
I'm desperately trying to suppress
my overwhelming desire

51
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,133
to see him.

52
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:45,600
While they just chat about
everything I'm trying to forget.

53
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,333
Of course, I want to

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
see Naoki

55
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,600
and kiss him and have him
hold me tight.

56
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,367
No, that would be too much to ask.

57
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:04,967
I just want to catch
a glimpse from afar.

58
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,433
To see him.

59
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,333
Just a glimpse from afar.

60
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,833
That's right!

61
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:34,867
I did it...! How bold of me.

62
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:39,167
But just one glimpse from afar.

63
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,167
If it's just a glimpse.

64
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:45,300
I haven't broken my vow.

65
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,933
Because...

66
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,067
Because I...

67
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:58,767
I need to recharge myself!

68
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:10,833
<i>So this</i>

69
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:15,533
<i>is where Naoki lives!</i>

70
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:30,567
I'm breathing the same air.

71
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,533
Dr. Irie!

72
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:46,567
Dr. Nomaguchi wants
to speak with you.

73
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,967
He's in the outpatient
consulting room.

74
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,133
-Thanks.
-Excuse me.

75
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,067
There you are! Naoki!

76
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:04,933
I'm feeling more energized
by the minute.

77
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:08,100
Now I can return to Tokyo and...

78
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,833
It's Dr. Irie!

79
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,933
I swear, he's such a hottie!

80
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,700
The hottest intern, for sure!

81
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,433
I wonder if he's married.

82
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,833
Yes, his wife is right here.

83
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,967
I heard he's single.

84
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,533
But he's so eligible.

85
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,467
He probably doesn't need a girlfriend.

86
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,533
Hey...

87
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,333
Maybe I'll make a move.

88
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,367
Impossible. Too much competition.

89
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,800
I know of at least 10 girls
who are after him.

90
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,233
So I'd be 11.

91
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,533
Oh my God.

92
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,300
It's fine.

93
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,600
This happened all the time in Tokyo.

94
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,300
Maybe I should go home

95
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,867
while I'm still recharged.

96
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,300
Move it!

97
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,000
You're standing there like an idiot!

98
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>Who is this girl? She sounds like</i>
<i>a Kobe-version of Yuki.</i>

99
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,500
<i>I have to be firm with kids like her!</i>

100
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,767
You should apologize
when you bump into someone.

101
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,933
Please apologize.

102
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,100
Idiot!

103
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,033
<i>The little brat!</i>

104
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,767
Mom. She looks like a snake!

105
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,267
Nami!

106
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,567
I'm sorry. She has such a foul mouth.

107
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,767
<i>Her mom is so young and pretty.</i>

108
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,700
Go!

109
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,933
Sorry I called you a snake.

110
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,867
How adorable. Never mind.

111
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:57,567
You look more like a clown.

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Nami!

113
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,133
Exactly like a clown. Exactly!

114
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,367
Wait! Don't run.

115
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,767
It's Dr. Irie!

116
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,267
No running in hospitals, Nami.

117
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes doctor.

118
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,633
You know who I just saw?

119
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,333
A lady who looked just like a clown.

120
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,800
A lady who looked like a clown?

121
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,233
I would've liked to see that.

122
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I wonder where she went?

123
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,533
Hello, doctor.

124
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:31,233
Hello. You're here today.

125
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:35,600
What? Do they know Naoki?

126
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,267
What are you doing, Nami?

127
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,433
I'm sorry, doctor.
She's such a rascal.

128
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,900
Mom takes forever with her make-up
whenever she's going to see you.

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
What are you talking about?

130
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,900
For real! Mommy's in love with Dr. Irie!

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,667
That's enough.

132
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,767
Dr. Irie. Do you have time
to see me today?

134
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,533
Of course.

135
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:13,767
Five p.m. at the Central Park, then.

136
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:14,700
Okay.

137
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,067
What?

138
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:21,433
Another date with my mom, Dr. Irie?

139
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,467
I guess.

140
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,600
Naoki.

141
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,067
<i>It's getting dark. Why...?</i>

142
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,233
<i>What am I doing here? This is pitiful.</i>

143
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,700
Dr. Irie's late.

144
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,433
<i>But I have to find out what's</i>
<i>going on between them.</i>

145
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,633
<i>I can't go home yet!</i>

146
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,367
<i>Here he comes!</i>

147
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,133
-Doctor.
-It's Dr. Irie!

148
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,367
Sorry I'm late.

149
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,800
Thanks for coming.

150
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,233
Naoki.

151
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,333
Let's go on the slide, Dr. Irie!

152
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,667
Nami!

153
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,100
It's right over there.

154
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Nami, go buy some juice.

155
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,767
I guess I'm a third wheel.
I'll leave you two alone.

156
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,567
How rude.

157
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,333
Don't leave them alone!

158
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,367
What's happening here?

159
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,400
What? This must be

160
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,767
some kind of mistake. Right?

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,700
Naoki.

162
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,600
Found you!

163
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,300
Dr. Irie! Over here!

164
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,067
Hurry! The clown lady..

165
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:13,633
Be quiet! He'll see me!

166
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,367
Kotoko.

167
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,833
What are you doing?

168
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:39,333
Oh, no!

169
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,233
The mother and daughter
are named Shiina.

170
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,033
The daughter, Nami, is my patient.

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm not her attending doctor, but...

172
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,400
She seems so healthy.

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,233
It may seem that way now, but...

174
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,067
She has a congenital heart disease.

175
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:12,633
She's already had strokes in the past.

176
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,433
Her heart...

177
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,033
She had one surgery
when she was 5.

178
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:22,700
But the heart is a complex organ.

179
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,867
She needed another surgery
once she got a little older.

180
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,433
Her attending doctor and I
think that now is the best time.

181
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,500
But...

182
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:42,633
Nami lost her father two years ago.

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,233
Nami is scared that...

184
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:52,467
this surgery might take her life as well.

185
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,200
Her mom is worried, too.

186
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,867
I was trying to advise them ...

187
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:09,133
I see. I...

188
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,033
Wait. Are you going to
be a pediatrician?

189
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,267
Didn't you know?

190
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,633
No, I didn't.

191
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:23,433
I thought you were going
to be a surgeon.

192
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,267
I want to study pediatrics.

193
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:30,367
This hospital is really
excelling in that area.

194
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,133
At first, I was considering
being a surgeon, but...

195
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,800
What do I really want to do?

196
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,900
Why did I want to become a doctor?

197
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,967
When I asked myself that...

198
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,733
the answer came quite easily.

199
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,733
The reason you wanted
to become a doctor?

200
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,867
Never mind. It's nothing.

201
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,533
What? What? What?

202
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,367
It's a secret. Let's go to sleep.

203
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to know! Please!

204
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,467
Good night.

205
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:19,033
<i>Naoki, a pediatrician.</i>

206
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
<i>Yes.</i>

207
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,600
<i>Sounds good!</i>

208
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,533
I'm going.

209
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,933
Sorry I can't see you off.

210
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,133
I'll be fine. I'm totally energized.

211
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,267
I'm sure everyone is worried about me.

212
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,833
Good luck on your internship.

213
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,000
It's the clown lady!

214
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,133
She's with Dr. Irie again!
Were you together since yesterday?

215
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,767
Nami.

216
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,400
What is the clown lady to you,
Dr. Irie?

217
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,467
Nami!

218
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:10,533
I highly doubt it, but I have to ask.
Is she your girlfriend?

219
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,800
I wouldn't say girlfriend.

220
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Nami. Don't be rude.

221
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,100
She's not.

222
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,000
I knew it! I knew that was impossible.

223
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,167
Watch what you say!

224
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm really sorry.

225
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,900
She's my wife.

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,833
She's my wife.

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,167
No.

228
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:37,700
It's true.

229
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,600
It's not true. I don't believe it.

230
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,200
Nami.

231
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,567
Because...

232
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,467
You're going to marry my mom!

233
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,767
My mom is way prettier.

234
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,467
She's a super cook.

235
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,933
And...

236
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,567
Nami.

237
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,467
I can't do that.

238
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,033
Stupid!

239
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,667
Nami, don't run!

240
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,067
Nami!

241
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:26,867
Nami!

242
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,533
Nami?

243
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,233
Nami

244
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:40,167
must be scared. Her dad died
and now she's sick, too.

245
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,700
That's why she wishes
you were her dad.

246
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,433
She looks up to you.

247
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:58,133
Don't worry. The surgery is in 3 days.
I'll convince here before then.

248
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,267
I'll do whatever I can, too.

249
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,467
Me, too! Leave it to me, Mom!

250
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,833
I'll convince Nami to have the surgery!

251
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,500
What are you talking about?
Aren't you going home?

252
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,033
I can't leave at a time like this!

253
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,567
You should go home.

254
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,267
But I'm partly responsible!

255
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,633
You're too direct when you
talk to little kids, Naoki.

256
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:27,067
You have to take their feelings
into consideration.

257
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,333
Mrs. Shiina, don't worry!
I'm going to be a nurse.

258
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:36,100
I decided yesterday that
I'm going to be a pediatric nurse!

259
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,200
You can't do that.

260
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,167
Why don't we give it a try?

261
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,300
Yes!

262
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,767
The situation calls
for desperate measures.

263
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,200
Yes! I am very desperate!

264
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,500
That's not what she meant.

265
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,133
Over the next 3 days, I'll focus all
my energy on convincing Nami!

266
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,567
I want her to get better
as soon as possible

267
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:02,067
and give up on marrying Naoki!

268
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,667
Tadaa! I'm here to visit...

269
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,000
Nami?

270
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,200
Wrong person.

271
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,200
What are you doing here?

272
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,233
Nami!

273
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:26,400
I thought I'd bring you some flowers.

274
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:30,033
But I got the wrong patient.
Do you like flowers?

275
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,100
No!

276
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,900
-But I brought them.
-I said no!

277
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
I love roses, but...

278
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,633
Here again?

279
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,700
Here again.

280
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,333
That's a fox.

281
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,800
It's not a dog?

282
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,667
No! A dog

283
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,700
barks like this.

284
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,567
How?

285
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,200
This is how you make a barking dog.

286
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,267
<i>I ended up staying in Kobe.</i>

287
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,233
<i>Two days passed</i>

288
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,000
<i>with no progress whatsoever.</i>

289
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,867
It's you again.

290
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,000
I bought some sweets.
Let's eat them together!

291
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,433
Are you ready to have surgery
and get better?

292
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:30,400
Are you ready to break up
with Dr. Irie?

293
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,133
Sorry, no can do.

294
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,033
What's with the accent?

295
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,867
I can't believe you got
Dr. Irie to marry you.

296
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,333
I'll give you credit for that.

297
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,133
Well he's only human.

298
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,233
He couldn't resist my charms, I guess.

299
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,133
I take it back.
Give me back that credit.

300
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,633
I'm kidding! Well...

301
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:59,867
It was a long hard road
to win Naoki's heart.

302
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,233
I bet it was.

303
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,933
It was love at first sight in 10th grade.
A confession of love in 12th grade.

304
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:11,933
A lot happened and we ended up
moving in with his family.

305
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:15,767
What? That's too easy! No fair!

306
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,367
I guess you can call it fate.

307
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,933
Fate...

308
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,733
Our love just gradually blossomed
after that.

309
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:33,700
But you must have had rivals.
Dr. Irie must have been popular.

310
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,700
Yes. Fierce rivals.

311
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,367
But all along, I sent
powerful laser beams of love

312
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:40,967
in his direction.

313
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,367
No one could compete with that!

314
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:46,767
That must have turned people off.

315
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,700
But I'm confident that
I love Naoki more than anyone else!

316
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:58,200
When you get a little older,
you'll fall in love with a handsome guy.

317
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:02,000
You'll have to get stronger
so you can persevere, like I did!

318
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,900
Then you'll find a boyfriend
like Naoki, too.

319
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Nami.

320
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,033
You're using your mom as a decoy.

321
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:18,333
You're the one that's in love
with Naoki, aren't you?

322
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,600
What are you saying?
I'm doing it for my mom.

323
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,133
That's okay!

324
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,667
Naoki is like Superman.

325
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,733
He'll always come to the rescue.

326
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,800
He's an intern, but everyone knows
of his superpowers.

327
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,700
He'll come to your rescue, too.

328
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,100
You believe in him, don't you Nami?

329
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:50,100
Yeah

330
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:55,667
But even if I have the surgery
and get better...

331
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,467
Dr. Irie is still your husband.

332
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:04,500
And I'm sure you'll never give him up.

333
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:09,500
Isn't there someone else

334
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,300
that looks just like Dr. Irie?

335
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,367
That would give me hope.

336
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:22,767
Nami!

337
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:26,767
I have an idea.

338
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,333
You'll have the surgery? Really?

339
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,133
Yes! I'll go for it!

340
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,700
Really?

341
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,067
That's good!

342
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,533
Good girl, Nami. Thanks.

343
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:46,867
Okay! Leave it to Dr. Irie and me!

344
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
Right, Dr. Irie?

345
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,833
Yes.

346
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,967
What made you change your mind?

347
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:58,733
She promised me
that after my surgery...

348
00:24:58,833 --> 00:24:59,667
Right?

349
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,900
Right!

350
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,867
What are you scheming now?

351
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,967
What? Me? Nothing.

352
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,967
It's our little secret!

353
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,167
Yup ...

354
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,733
Thank you so much.

355
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,933
We'll start as soon as we're ready.

356
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,867
I don't know what you did,

357
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,167
but thanks.

358
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:53,833
Dr. Irie.

359
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,300
What? Are you scared?

360
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,767
Don't worry. It will be over
before you know it.

361
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,500
I'm not scared at all.

362
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,967
Because I trust you, Dr. Irie.

363
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,167
Thanks.

364
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,633
Why did you want
to become a doctor?

365
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,567
When I was struggling,

366
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:28,133
unable to decide what I should do,

367
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:34,100
someone told me I should
become a doctor.

368
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:39,000
I thought, "Maybe so..."

369
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,467
Was it her?

370
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:49,133
I'm sure she doesn't even
remember it.

371
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,967
Is Nami.

372
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:30,733
She's fine!

373
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:33,967
Thank you!

374
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,767
Thank God.

375
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,767
Sorry I broke my vow.

376
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:55,000
But I'm well suited to be
a pediatric nurse, don't you think?

377
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,033
Oh, yeah.

378
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,600
Nami asked me to give you this.

379
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,633
Nami! How is she doing?

380
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,667
Great. Kids are so resilient.

381
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,700
That's good.

382
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,767
What did she write?

383
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:22,100
"Kotoko. I'm getting
stronger and stronger every day.

384
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,567
I'll see you in Tokyo soon.

385
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:31,100
If you break your promise,
I'll kill you.

386
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,033
Nami.

387
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,900
Scary.

388
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:43,200
What did you promise her?

389
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,700
Well...

390
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:50,467
What? Tell me.

391
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,000
Actually...

392
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,800
You promised to set her up with Yuki?!

393
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,567
But! But...

394
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:03,767
She wanted someone just like you,

395
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,300
but I wasn't about to give you up.

396
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:09,433
Nami said, "I'll have the sugery, then."
So...

397
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,267
I thought, "Yes!" and...

398
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:15,633
then it was too late to turn back...

399
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,933
And...

400
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
You promised her that?

401
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,133
Idiot! You liar!

402
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,333
How can you make promises
that you can't keep?

403
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,333
What am I going to say to Nami?

404
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,733
Well, so...

405
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:39,033
I thought the genius Naoki
would think of a plan ...

406
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,533
I have no plan.

407
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,033
What about Konomi?
You set her up with Yuki, too!

408
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:50,367
I know. I feel awful about that.

409
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:54,000
But I thought Nami
would forget by now ...

410
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:10,300
<i>This isn't how I wanted to part.</i>

411
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:17,800
See you.

412
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,233
Thanks for seeing me off.

413
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,367
<i>Why do I always, always</i>

414
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,033
<i>mess things up.</i>

415
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:33,967
Pass the National Exams in one shot.

416
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,600
Naoki!

417
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:49,800
I...

418
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,600
I'll do my best!

419
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,567
<i>Wait for me, Naoki.</i>

420
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:07,967
<i>I'll become the best nurse in Japan!</i>
<i>A nurse worthy to work by your side!</i>

421
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:28,567
<i>The seasons came and went.</i>
<i>Summer passed.</i>

422
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,467
<i>Then autumn passed.</i>

423
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:53,567
<i>Is the long, long winter</i>

424
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:57,433
<i>ever going to pass?</i>

425
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,833
Okay!

426
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,500
2 WEEKS LATER

427
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,800
NATIONAL EXAMINATION RESULTS

428
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,467
NATIONAL NURSING EXAMINATION
RESULTS

429
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,267
It's 2:00 p.m.

430
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,333
Hurry up, Kotoko!

431
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,533
No! I can't do it!

432
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,533
Hey.

433
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,500
Hey, Kotoko!

434
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:39,367
It will be fine, Kotoko.

435
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,867
You studied so hard.

436
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:47,533
But mom, my test ID was 794.

437
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,533
That stands for "cry." It's bad luck!

438
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:53,367
Really? Oh, my.

439
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,133
Okay. 794.

440
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,467
I'll look for you.

441
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,700
I passed!

442
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
Me too!

443
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Me too!

444
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,800
Me too!

445
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:19,833
Moto-chan, Marina, Keita
and Tomoko.

446
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,533
You all passed.

447
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,167
I passed!

448
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:46,333
Yes!

449
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:48,233
Congratulations!

450
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:53,633
You did it, Kotoko! By miracle
or by coincidence, you passed!

451
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:58,167
It's a miracle! Kotoko passed the
National Nursing Exam in one shot!

452
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:01,700
Are you sure Naoki didn't
take the test for you?

453
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,300
You're so mean!

454
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,900
But you'd better study five more years.

455
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,867
For the patients' sake.

456
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,933
-You have a point.
-You have a point.

457
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,567
-We're in sync!
-We're in sync!

458
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,900
Dads! You, too?

459
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,100
But...

460
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,067
Now, we're all nurses!

461
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,367
Yeah.

462
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:27,033
I did it!

463
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,933
Let's celebrate!

464
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,067
Yes!

465
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,333
<i>The long winter is finally over.</i>

466
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:44,333
<i>And spring finally arrived at my doorstep.</i>

467
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,567
<i>But...</i>

468
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,100
<i>This is a voicemail box.</i>

469
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:55,667
<i>After the beep, leave your name</i>
<i>and a brief message...</i>

470
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,367
He's not picking up!

471
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,533
Why?

472
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:05,500
Are you on night duty?
I passed the Nursing Exam!

473
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,200
I don't want to leave that on voicemail.

474
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,700
Right.

475
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,167
I'll go to Kobe and...

476
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:28,833
tell him myself. Yes!

477
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,533
Will you be okay, Kotoko?
Do you remember the way?

478
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,133
No worries!

479
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,467
<i>Naoki, I want you to be the first</i>
<i>to see me</i>

480
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,933
<i>as a nurse!</i>

481
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,533
It's cold.

482
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:06,867
Why is this happening to me?

483
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,667
I made it on the last train, but ...

484
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:17,667
I have no idea where I am.

485
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:27,567
I don't have a map or a cell phone,
so I can't call him.

486
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,167
It's cold.

487
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,967
Is this really happening?

488
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,867
Oh, well.

489
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,933
I guess I'll be like
that drunken old man.

490
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,433
Excuse me, sir.

491
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:59,167
I'm not used to this kind of thing.
I don't know the rules ...

492
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,167
This may be an imposition,

493
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:05,900
but can I sleep here tonight?

494
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

495
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,767
I've never slept outdoors before.

496
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,600
Don't mind my clothes.

497
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,533
I'm not into cosplay or anything.

498
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:27,267
There's a story behind this.
A long story.

499
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,233
Can I tell you my story?

500
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,667
You can go to sleep.
I'll just talk by myself.

501
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:40,167
My husband

502
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:45,300
is a brilliant doctor working
at a hospital here in Kobe.

503
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,467
I've been studying and studying to be
a nurse in Tokyo. And finally, today...

504
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:52,600
Now it's yesterday...

505
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,833
I passed the National Nursing Exam!

506
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:59,633
And I wanted to tell Nao--

507
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,433
My husband in person so

508
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,167
<i>I jumped on a bullet train to Kobe.</i>

509
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:10,267
<i>I wanted to surprise him,</i>
<i>so I wore this nurse's uniform.</i>

510
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,967
<i>But someone got sick on the train</i>

511
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,500
{\an8}<i>so I got off at Shin-Osaka</i>
<i>and helped him find an ambulance.</i>

512
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,800
<i>By then, the train had left</i>

513
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,700
<i>and my coat was still on it</i>

514
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,067
<i>along with my cell phone and map.</i>

515
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:34,033
<i>I shook it off and got on the next train,</i>
<i>but it didn't stop at Shin-Kobe.</i>

516
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,000
It's like a nightmare.

517
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,933
Hey!

518
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:49,900
You don't have to laugh. I...

519
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,733
That must have been rough.

520
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,000
Hi.

521
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:10,967
How can I go to sleep?
You talk so loud.

522
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,900
I had 3 days of non-stop surgeries.

523
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,400
I wanted to surprise you, but...

524
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,633
You did, believe me.

525
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,933
Why... Why are you sleeping here?

526
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,600
Mom called me at the hospital.

527
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,367
She said you were headed over here

528
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:41,367
and I should pick you up
because you'd get lost for sure.

529
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:47,367
But I never thought
you'd get on the wrong train.

530
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,767
Why don't you ever call
before you come?

531
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:58,167
Because you never

532
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,733
answer your phone or voicemails.

533
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,833
I wanted to tell you the minute

534
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,500
I found out

535
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,633
We can finally work together.

536
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,633
You studied hard all year.

537
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,200
Naoki!

538
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,400
You look good in that uniform.

539
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,333
Thanks.

540
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,600
So I got off at Shin-Osaka.

541
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,867
I heard already.

542
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:56,633
And I left my coat and cell phone
on the train!

543
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:57,967
I heard already.

544
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:01,967
I was telling that old man.

545
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,133
And in Okayama.

546
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:06,567
Your story was better before.

547
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,567
I know.

548
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,133
I asked which way to Shin-Kobe

549
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,500
and they said this was the last train.

550
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,900
I heard already.

551
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,833
I didn't know which platform
was for Shin-Kobe and...

552
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:20,933
I asked the station staff...

553
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,433
{\an8}NEXT EPISODE
EP.13 "FLOWERS AND STORMS"

554
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,700
{\an8}They told me
there were no vacancy in Kobe!

555
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:00,800
Ms. Irie.

556
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:02,767
I'll teach you how to give injections.

557
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,867
-Gauze.
-Yes.

558
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:08,567
You'll be a burden on Dr. Irie!

559
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:09,833
The real Kotoko

560
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,600
would trample over
flowers and storms

561
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,567
<i>That's right. All I can do is try.</i>

562
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,433
<i>We can finally work together.</i>

563
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,533
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

564
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,000
The artery needs to be closed.

565
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:20,900
No! Let's wait ...

566
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,100
{\an8}Kotoko!

567
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,867
{\an8}Put on a gown, now!
