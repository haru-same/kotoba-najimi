1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,833
<i>Chris was splattered with hot oil?</i>

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,633
If anything happens to Chris, I...

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,733
Her burns have
penetrated the inner skin.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,833
Oh...

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Regarding scarring...

6
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:14,600
How's is it?!

7
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,533
Some of it might stay.

8
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,767
Naoki!

9
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,933
What's wrong, Naoki?

10
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,500
What's all this, Kotoko?

11
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,367
Naoki has a long surgery tonight.

12
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:37,533
I thought I'd bring him
a nutritious meal.

13
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:41,800
Naoki!

14
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,467
You just finished your surgery!

15
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:49,300
I wanted to bring you
something nutritious...

16
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,967
...that will give you stamina...

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,033
Ouch...

18
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,667
Naoki...

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,033
Naoki?

20
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,700
Naoki?

21
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,167
Naoki!

22
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,133
Naoki!

23
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,933
Naoki!

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,767
No!

25
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,467
Naoki! Naoki!

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,533
Naoki!

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,100
Naoki! Open your eyes!

28
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:48,800
Kotoko!

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,867
-What's going on?
-Moto-chan...

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,100
I just heard at the nurse's station...

31
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,600
What happened?

32
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,400
Naoki...

33
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:05,300
Naoki fell from the stairs...
trying to break my fall...

34
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,367
What if he dies...?

35
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,400
Come on. Calm down.

36
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,767
What did the doctor say?

37
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,533
Dr. Nishigaki just told me
to get out of the room.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,767
He wouldn't let me in.

39
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:24,100
Naoki is unconscious.
He hit his head...

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,900
Oh, my God! It's my fault...

41
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:31,400
What if he dies because of me?

42
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,833
-I... won't...
-Kotoko!

43
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,067
Calm down.

44
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,167
You're a nurse, aren't you?

45
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,467
You can't panic like this.

46
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,967
You're Dr. Irie's wife.

47
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,267
You have to be strong!

48
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,267
Dr. Nishigaki is one of
the best doctors here.

49
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,500
Okay...

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,533
<i>Please, God!</i>

51
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:09,900
<i>Save Naoki...</i>

52
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,267
<i>Please save him!</i>

53
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:06,600
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

54
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,967
{\an8}TEARFUL PROPOSAL

55
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,333
Ouch...

56
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,000
I remember...

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,367
...Kotoko and food...

58
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,733
So, my leg...

59
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,900
...is broken.

60
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,700
You're up, Naoki!

61
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:18,133
Thank goodness!

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,267
You know,

63
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,700
you broke your leg yesterday.

64
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,433
I can see that.

65
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,567
You were sleeping all this time.

66
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,600
You're here to take
my temperature, right?

67
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,333
Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,967
Put this under your arm.

69
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,767
May I see your arm?

70
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:09,067
I have to draw blood
and give you two IVs.

71
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,133
What's the diagnosis?

72
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,933
Simple fracture of
the lower right leg.

73
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,033
It's terribly swollen,
so, until it goes down

74
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,233
you'll be hospitalized
with mandatory bed rest.

75
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,833
In addition, fatigue-induced

76
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:30,300
anemia, sleep deprivation,
and malnutrition...

77
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:33,800
It's overwork.

78
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:38,800
Lack of sleep, overwork,
malnutrition, anemia.

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,033
He's not unconscious.
He's fast asleep.

80
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,133
There's nothing wrong with his brain.

81
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,133
He'll recover in two months.

82
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,667
Kotoko?

83
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:05,767
You didn't pass out
because you hit your head.

84
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,400
It was overwork.

85
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,300
Overwork?

86
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,733
It's my fault! I tired you out!

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,833
Kotoko.

88
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,767
You became anemic
and broke your leg

89
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,300
all because of me!

90
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:28,167
So... so... so...

91
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:32,100
I want to take full responsibility
and take care of you.

92
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,100
I'll be your legs!

93
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,267
Hey...

94
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,233
It's my duty as a nurse
and your wife!

95
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,000
Open wide.

96
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,300
Come on! Open wide!

97
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,000
I said I can feed myself!

98
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:00,767
You just broke your leg!
Don't push it!

99
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,367
It's my leg that's broken.

100
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:06,833
Patients must listen to the nurse.

101
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,833
Open up. Come on!

102
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,133
I got that! Nice shot!

103
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,867
Mom!

104
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,367
I brought your stuff.

105
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,933
Konomi.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,700
-You came.
-Yes.

107
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:26,200
She insisted on coming.

108
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:29,800
You asked me to come with you...

109
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,033
Shut up!

110
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,133
Just admit it!

111
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:41,500
Naoki, you're so lame.

112
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,467
Falling down the stairs.

113
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,900
Mom, I'm the one that fell
and Naoki tried to--

114
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,233
Catch his beloved wife!

115
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,333
Where's your triple-flip landing?

116
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,700
I'm not a circus act.

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,833
Oh, my God!

118
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,533
So, it's true!

119
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,767
We heard and came running!

120
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,700
Chris. Kin-chan.

121
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,067
You tried to save Kotoko
and got hurt instead.

122
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,867
How unfortunate.

123
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:25,700
How lame, Irie!
You should be ashamed!

124
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,667
Okay, Naoki. Time to draw blood.

125
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,300
Wow!

126
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,967
It's Nightingale Kotoko.

127
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,200
Okay.

128
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,567
Draw my blood, too.

129
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,267
Let's see you at work, Kotoko.

130
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,467
Here we go.

131
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,400
Give me your arm.

132
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,533
Aren't there any other nurses?

133
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,233
Why? I'm right here.

134
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

135
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,133
First, some alcohol.

136
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
It'll feel cold a bit.

137
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,867
Okay.

138
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,067
Just a little prick.

139
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:13,100
-Here!
-Ouch!

140
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,033
Huh? It's not going in. I'm sorry.

141
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,500
The needle is supposed to
go under the skin!

142
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,567
Sorry. One more time.

143
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,967
This time... Here we go.

144
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,467
Don't maul me!

145
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,267
There! Success.

146
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,267
Success?
How long did that take you?

147
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,633
I was so nervous
drawing your blood.

148
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,900
What if I failed?

149
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,867
Don't worry. You did.

150
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,067
The IV is next.

151
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,500
The needle is already in!
I'm not your pin cushion!

152
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,133
Oh, yeah.

153
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,900
Oops.

154
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,733
<i>So, Naoki's hospital stay began.</i>

155
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,567
I'll peel an apple for you.

156
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,433
It's okay. Just leave it.

157
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:35,667
Ouch!

158
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,100
Are you okay?

159
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,567
What beautiful weather...

160
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,033
Isn't it nice outside, Naoki?

161
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,700
The birdies...

162
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:53,800
Kotoko! Watch out!

163
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,867
Sorry, Naoki. I wasn't looking.

164
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,233
Don't get so mad.

165
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,500
Let's move on!

166
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,933
<i>I'm focusing all my energy on</i>
<i>taking care of Naoki, but...</i>

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,333
I'm a failure as a nurse and wife.

168
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,133
NAOKI IRIE

169
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,533
Okay.

170
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,167
Good morning!

171
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,267
Morning.

172
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:47,200
Blood pressure: 104 over 76.

173
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,667
Sorry I woke you up last night.

174
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,100
It's fine.

175
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,067
I'm used to it.

176
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:04,167
You were on the night shift.
Are you done now?

177
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,067
Yeah.

178
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:11,133
Can you put this on my desk
before you leave?

179
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,067
Okay. I'll put it on your desk.

180
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,833
Thanks.

181
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,533
Okay!

182
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,100
MEDICAL OFFICE

183
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,100
Excuse me.

184
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,633
Hi, Kotoko.

185
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,733
Oh.

186
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:35,000
Naoki asked me
to put this on his desk.

187
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,100
It's right there.

188
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,567
How is he?

189
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,567
He's doing better.

190
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:48,333
Irie is so lucky to have such
a cute wife to care for him.

191
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:52,400
You're just saying that
because it's true!

192
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,733
Sorry!

193
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,433
Where's a rag?

194
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,367
Looks like it's okay...

195
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,567
It's legible.
I'm sure once it's dried out...

196
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,300
Right?

197
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,467
Right.

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,467
NEXT DAY

199
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:33,900
Good morning, Dr. Irie.
Here's your breakfast.

200
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,500
Thanks. What's up with you
for getting this to me?

201
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,867
Kotoko is blocking all the other nurses
from entering your room.

202
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,733
No one can come near you.

203
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,767
Really?

204
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,433
By the way.

205
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,667
Kotoko's not here yet.
That's unusual.

206
00:15:53,733 --> 00:16:00,633
In that case, let me feed you.

207
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,433
Hold it right there!

208
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm Naoki's private nurse!

209
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,000
That's my job!

210
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,300
Such a commotion for
first thing in the morning.

211
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,267
I'll take care of him today.

212
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,867
Open wide, Dr. Irie!

213
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,333
My hands are fine.

214
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,700
I wanted you to eat this.

215
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,367
Tada!

216
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,767
It's so garlicky!

217
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,167
Fried cutlet
with garlic scrambled eggs.

218
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:38,267
Fried chicken
and garlic barbeque meat.

219
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,900
Okra salad.
Sticky stuff is good for you.

220
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,267
For breakfast?

221
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:49,400
You couldn't eat my meal
the other night.

222
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,800
Actually, that was the reason
you broke your leg...

223
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,733
But I'll make you breakfast
every morning.

224
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,833
Every morning?

225
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,433
Yes! I bet you can't wait!

226
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,967
Ms. Irie! Are you still
dilly-dallying around here?

227
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,300
Nurse Shimizu...

228
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:10,567
I know you're his wife,
but finish your duties first!

229
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,500
You deliberately missed
our meeting, too!

230
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,167
You're supposed to change
Mr. Sakamoto's sheets!

231
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,167
I'm sorry...

232
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,600
-Go!
-Yes.

233
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
See you later, Naoki.

234
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,167
How powerful she is.

235
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,567
Do you have a minute, Irie?

236
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,133
What is it, Dr. Kato?

237
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,633
It's about Mr. Kusakabe's surgery.

238
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:56,133
He has esophageal cancer,

239
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,700
so, I think esophageal resection
and restoration would be appropriate.

240
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,500
Oh, I see. Yes.

241
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:06,733
I'm sorry I can't operate
with this broken leg.

242
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,167
No, you need the rest.

243
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,267
And...

244
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,333
I wrote down some notes
on the surgical procedure.

245
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,967
They're on my desk.

246
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,767
That will be helpful.
On your desk, right?

247
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,600
Yes, on my desk.

248
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,100
Huh? On your desk...

249
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:30,900
Dr. Kato?

250
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,267
It's midnight.

251
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm sure Naoki's sleeping.

252
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll just take a peek at his face.

253
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:17,100
He's sleeping well. How cute.

254
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,500
Good night, Naoki.

255
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,567
You scared me. Were you up?

256
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,500
I wanted to ask you something.

257
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,067
What?

258
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,800
What is this?

259
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,567
This should dry it out quickly.

260
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:09,167
It will dry on its own.

261
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,300
But I want it to dry nicely.

262
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,233
I see.

263
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,333
Okay...

264
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,333
This is...

265
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,833
What did you try to do?

266
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:43,200
I wanted to be of use to you.

267
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,833
Don't do anything
I don't ask you to do!

268
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,167
Thank God I remembered everything.

269
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,167
Never touch a doctor's desk!

270
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,567
It could be a matter of life or death!

271
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,533
I'm sorry!

272
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,800
I never thought this would happen.

273
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:05,200
I wanted to ease your burden,

274
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:11,867
but I spilled coffee on it.
Caused a lot of trouble for Dr. Kato, too.

275
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:20,533
All I did just made more work for you.

276
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,867
I love you, but...

277
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,300
I love you so much, but...

278
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:36,467
But I keep getting you tired
and even injured.

279
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,667
I'm bad luck for you.

280
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,267
No matter what...

281
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,833
...I'll always...

282
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,700
...be a failure as your wife.

283
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,067
Then that wouldn't be just about you.
Me, too.

284
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,733
I couldn't even catch you.

285
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,867
Look what happened to me.

286
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,033
But...

287
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:24,300
I failed as your husband.

288
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,833
Naoki...

289
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,833
I should have caught my wife

290
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,900
and made a triple-flip landing.

291
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,033
While I've been here,

292
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,133
I realized how patients feel

293
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:58,600
and how hard you work.

294
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,900
A nurse and her patient...

295
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:17,033
This...

296
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
...is kind of sexy.

297
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,633
<i>Naoki's leg was healing nicely</i>

298
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,567
<i>thanks to the power of my love.</i>

299
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:47,800
-Proposal?
-Shh! Don't talk so loud!

300
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm not even talking loud.

301
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,467
Listen, Irie...

302
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,800
When you...

303
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:03,200
...proposed to Kotoko,
what did you say?

304
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,600
I don't really want to know...

305
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:10,100
...but you can tell me if you want to.

306
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:16,733
Well, it was the day
she rejected you.

307
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,833
Huh?

308
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,000
On the spur of the moment,
in front of family.

309
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:23,100
I said, "I'm marrying her."

310
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:28,500
-Mr. Aihara, I need to talk to you.
-You should change your cloth first--

311
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,600
I would like to...

312
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,567
To marry your daughter.

313
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,933
Naoki!

314
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,300
On the spur of the moment?
Without asking Kotoko first?

315
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:58,733
I didn't need her approval.
I knew she'd say yes.

316
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,167
What an ego...

317
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:06,600
Did that help?

318
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:08,467
Hell no!

319
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,600
Forget it!

320
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,600
Kin-chan!

321
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,867
Kin-chan! What's happening?

322
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,100
He's going to propose to Chris.

323
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,333
I see.

324
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,867
What...

325
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,467
What?!

326
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,867
Really?

327
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,100
Wow, Kin-chan. Finally...
He's going to propose to Chris!

328
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,900
She'll be so happy.

329
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,400
They can be happily married.
Just like us!

330
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,933
I have to check it out!

331
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,900
There they are!

332
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,467
What do you say, Chris?

333
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,433
I...

334
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,800
...can't marry you, Kinnosuke.

335
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,200
What?

336
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
Did you just say "you can't?"

337
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,267
Yes.

338
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,433
You can't marry me?

339
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,267
Sorry, Kinnosuke...

340
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,833
Forget...

341
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,500
...about me.

342
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,867
Chris!

343
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,133
Why did you refuse
Kin-chan's proposal?

344
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,867
Kotoko...

345
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,400
You love him so much!
You were waiting for this!

346
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,267
Kotoko, I need a favor.

347
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,400
What?

348
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:55,567
Do you have plans
to break up with Irie?

349
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,700
Huh?

350
00:27:56,767 --> 00:28:00,400
No! Of course not! Are you kidding?

351
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,733
Will you break up with Naoki
and marry Kinnosuke?

352
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,467
Huh?

353
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:08,867
Kinnosuke is a better cook
and he's very kind.

354
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,467
And he's a total hunk.

355
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:15,033
You should remarry Kinnosuke.

356
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,200
Wait...

357
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,933
Kinnosuke has always loved you, Kotoko!

358
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,467
Chris!

359
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,733
Will you do it?

360
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,467
I couldn't stand it if Kinnosuke
married anyone else.

361
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,800
It would be best
if he married you, Kotoko...

362
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,433
Chris...

363
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,300
This was unexpected.

364
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,733
I know.

365
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,567
Chris won't tell me
why she turned him down.

366
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm so confused.

367
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,067
He must be even more confused.
Poor guy.

368
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,467
She's hiding something.

369
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,133
JAPANESE CUISINE
AIHARA

370
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,333
Kinnosuke, do the prepping--

371
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,367
Aren't you done yet?

372
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,400
Forget it, boss.

373
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,633
Ever since he went to see Chris
yesterday, he's been useless.

374
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,733
What?

375
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:34,900
See?

376
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,900
What the hell happened, Kinnosuke?

377
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,467
I bet Chris turned him down.

378
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Chris turned him down?

379
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm not sure, but...

380
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:48,767
Oh...

381
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:58,833
Bingo...

382
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:00,333
What?

383
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:03,067
But Chris was totally
in love with him...

384
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:06,000
But I know how she feels.

385
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,833
I could never understand
why a cute girl like her

386
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,567
would go for a guy like him.

387
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,733
You're right...

388
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,900
And Kinnosuke was so cold to her.

389
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,367
He was taking her love for granted.

390
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:20,467
You're right.

391
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:21,833
What if...

392
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,600
...another guy showed her
a little kindness?

393
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,000
Another guy? Kindness?

394
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:32,067
Someone who could
fill the void in her heart.

395
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,900
Chris would change her mind.

396
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,133
Chris? Change her mind?

397
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,433
Shh! Boss!

398
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:44,333
Never mind, Kinnosuke.

399
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,367
He always blows things
out of proportion.

400
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,867
Why would Chris ever change her...

401
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:50,033
Kinnosuke?

402
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,233
-Kinnosuke... Kinnosuke!
-Hey, Kinnosuke! Hey!

403
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,100
Look what you did, boss!

404
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,433
Who, me?

405
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,467
Want some sweets?

406
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,767
Thank you Mrs. Abe,

407
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,233
but I'm not really hungry right now.

408
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,767
Come on. Have some with me.

409
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,967
I can't eat it all by myself.

410
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,133
Just one, then.

411
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,133
It's good.

412
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,033
See? Sweets always make you happy!

413
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:40,200
Mrs. Abe...

414
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,833
Mom.

415
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,833
Oh, Yuichi!

416
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,367
I happened to come nearby, so...

417
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:48,067
But isn't it a workday?

418
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,167
Yeah.

419
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,333
I just dropped by to see you...

420
00:31:56,767 --> 00:32:00,100
Yuichi! What's wrong with you?

421
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,333
Nothing.

422
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:07,867
Isn't she cute? Chris is from England.

423
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:10,700
My name is Christine Robbins.

424
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,300
Your mom has been so kind to me.

425
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,667
Oh... well...

426
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,067
If you're on your way out,

427
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,867
will you go buy candy
from downstairs?

428
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,367
Sure. On the first floor?

429
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:26,367
I'll show you where it is.

430
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,500
What?

431
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,833
I wanted to buy a box
of tissues anyway.

432
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:40,267
I was shocked.

433
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,167
I went to see my mom and...

434
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,600
You didn't expect to see a blondie?

435
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,933
Well, that, too, but...

436
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,667
I never expected to meet
such a lovely girl.

437
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,067
Thank you.

438
00:32:57,467 --> 00:33:00,967
It's nice to hear
a Japanese man say that.

439
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,267
Do you have a boyfriend?

440
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:09,900
Boyfriend?

441
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,233
Of course you do.

442
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,333
Boyfriend...

443
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,933
What's wrong?

444
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:28,233
I'm sorry.
I just remembered something...

445
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:32,033
Um... are you all right?

446
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,300
That's my Chris!

447
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,433
You made my Chris cry!

448
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,100
Who are you...?

449
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,667
You little pretty boy...

450
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:46,500
You stole my Chris away
and made her cry!

451
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,700
Kinnosuke!

452
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:49,600
Chris...

453
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:54,533
Excuse me.
Kin-chan!

454
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,133
I...

455
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,600
I'm really sorry.

456
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,300
I'm sorry!

457
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,667
What got into you, Kin-chan?

458
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,133
Never mind my stupid son.

459
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:19,233
Stupid son?

460
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,367
We all know how much
Kin-san loves Chris.

461
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,800
He came to see her every day!

462
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:29,967
He must be busy. It's not easy to do.

463
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,400
Unlike my stupid son.

464
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,233
Ouch!

465
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,667
I'd better get going, mom.

466
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,500
Work hard!

467
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm really sorry!

468
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:49,767
It was totally my mistake.

469
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:51,567
I thought your son...

470
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,167
...was Chris' new boyfriend.

471
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,300
If Chris loved someone else,
I'd have to give her up

472
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,067
and wish for her happiness.

473
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,433
But I had to see
what kind of guy it was...

474
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,667
Love someone else?

475
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:19,533
But you found someone new.
That's why you turned down my proposal.

476
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,700
Proposal?

477
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,033
No! I don't love anyone else!

478
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,000
Then why?
What don't you like about me?

479
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,167
I love you, Kinnosuke.

480
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:37,400
I always dreamt
that you'd propose to me.

481
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:41,067
You took good care of me
when I burned my leg.

482
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:42,800
Of course!
Just because I love you!

483
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:46,233
I'll be scarred for life,
but you still proposed.

484
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,167
I was so happy!

485
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:50,267
Then why?

486
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,800
Yeah! Why did you reject his proposal?

487
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:58,767
Because...
You're feeling pity for me.

488
00:35:58,833 --> 00:35:59,867
Pity?

489
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:04,633
You're so sweet. You know no one
will marry a scarred woman,

490
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,800
so, you said that
you have to take care of me.

491
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:07,900
I never...

492
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,833
I know you don't really love me...

493
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,700
-I don't want you to marry me out of pity.
-Stop that!

494
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:18,500
Who said anything about pity?

495
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:23,900
Your burn is nothing between us!

496
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,900
No matter how bad it is,
it will never gets in our way!

497
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:33,067
But you proposed so suddenly...

498
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,333
I see.

499
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,133
Will you believe me
if I'm scarred like you?

500
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:46,800
Kin-chan!

501
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,000
Kin-chan...

502
00:36:56,067 --> 00:37:00,100
Let's bring some tea to Dr. Irie
while Kotoko's not around...

503
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:02,067
Where's the kitchen?

504
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,600
Who is that?

505
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:09,833
Give me that!

506
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,967
No... Don't...

507
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,933
There you are!

508
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,033
Kotoko!

509
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,167
What are you doing, Kin-chan?

510
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:20,267
I'm going to burn my leg!

511
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,400
Don't! You'll burn yourself!

512
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:23,500
-No!
-That's hot!

513
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:24,700
Leave me alone Kotoko!

514
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:27,300
I'm going to be just like Chris!

515
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,800
Sorry, Kinnosuke!

516
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,467
I waited for so long.

517
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:39,767
You finally proposed to me
and-- And...

518
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:43,233
I refused. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

519
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,000
Chris...

520
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,967
How could I spend my life
with someone out of pity?

521
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,533
<i>Everyone besides Chris knew</i>

522
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,167
<i>that Kin-chan was crazy about her.</i>

523
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:08,800
Kinnosuke...

524
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,000
What?

525
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,167
Propose to me again.

526
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:17,800
What?

527
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:18,900
What?

528
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,733
I want to answer you properly.

529
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,833
Oh, my.

530
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,567
Here comes a proposal!

531
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,433
Propose to her properly.

532
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,133
Wait a minute...

533
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,533
With all you old ladies around?

534
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,167
Old ladies?

535
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,900
Don't be shy, Kin-san!

536
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,267
Be a man!

537
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,367
Propose to her!

538
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,233
Kinnosuke...

539
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,933
Well, then...

540
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:56,533
Let's get married, Chris!

541
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,033
Yes, Kinnosuke...

542
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,933
I love you so much!

543
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,433
I'm so happy!

544
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,267
A kiss! A kiss!

545
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:21,133
Nice try, Kin-chan!

546
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,100
My blood pressure goes up!

547
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:27,467
A Kansai-style proposal.
How passionate!

548
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,933
Congratulations, Kin-chan! Chris!

549
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:41,333
Congratulations!

550
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,633
Congratulations!

551
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:57,400
Thanks!

552
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,900
<i>According to Naoki,</i>

553
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:05,067
<i>Chris misunderstood</i>
<i>about the scarring.</i>

554
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:08,133
<i>There won't be any scars left.</i>
