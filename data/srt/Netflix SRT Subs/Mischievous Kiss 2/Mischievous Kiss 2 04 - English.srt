1
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:05,433
I'm going to study hard

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,833
and when I graduate,
I want to be a nurse.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,200
I know you'll say it's a job
that involves life and death.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,233
But I really believe in this.

5
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:19,767
So...

6
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,633
I want to be a nurse.

7
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:29,700
What do you think?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,667
If I tried to stop you,
you wouldn't listen.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,800
So...

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,467
give it a try.

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,600
Kinnosuke...

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,533
I'm running out of time.

13
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:58,000
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

14
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,167
{\an8}EXCITING! MY FIRST DATE

15
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,933
You came.

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Congratulations, Matsumoto.

17
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,567
Congratulations!

18
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,433
I heard you're transferring
to the nursing school.

19
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,867
How did you know?

20
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,867
It's a well-known fact.

21
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,967
You're still pursuing Naoki,
even in the medical field.

22
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:37,433
That makes it sound like
Naoki is my only motivation!

23
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:38,800
Isn't it?

24
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,867
You, too?

25
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:44,333
Well, I guess...

26
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,933
So, how did you do on the exam?

27
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,333
Ta-da!

28
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,100
"Congratulations." You passed?

29
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:02,767
I passed the highly competitive
nursing school examination!

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,400
<i>That's right! I did it.</i>

31
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,933
<i>I passed the nursing school</i>
<i>entrance exam!</i>

32
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't think it's the best thing
for people but...

33
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,033
I guess congratulations
are in order.

34
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:21,033
I share your concerns, but...

35
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,667
Naoki!

36
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,967
Oh, well. Good luck, nurse.

37
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,500
You're graduating!

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,767
Take care!

39
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,200
Thank you! You too.

40
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,367
You're leaving us.

41
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,700
Bye-bye!

42
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,167
Satomi!

43
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,300
Jinko!

44
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:59,200
Are those your friends
bawling their eyes out?

45
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,167
Actually... neither of them
are graduating.

46
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,233
They flunked?

47
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:12,500
Satomi hardly attended an elective
class which turned out to have

48
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,233
strict attendance requirements.

49
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,367
Jinko turned in her brother's homework
instead of her dissertation by mistake.

50
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,133
It sounds unreal, but it's true.

51
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,567
So, they flunked together?

52
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,533
Yeah.

53
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,900
They both had job offers and
their boyfriends had graduated.

54
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,467
Your friends are incredible.

55
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't bear to watch.

56
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,733
Don't act as if you're above it all.

57
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,000
You would have flunked, too.

58
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,267
Naoki!

59
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,500
Good thing she got into
the nursing school...

60
00:05:55,433 --> 00:06:00,867
I thought I had just enough
credits to graduate

61
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:04,033
but I made a slight miscalculation.

62
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,833
You shouldn't be laughing.

63
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,133
I can't believe you passed the test.

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,500
You can't even count
your credits accurately.

65
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,067
Are you cut out to be a nurse?

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,967
I'll be more careful!

67
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,200
God...

68
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,700
All three of you
are unable to graduate.

69
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,067
It's not an easy task.

70
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,933
I'm actually impressed.

71
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,267
How rude.

72
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,500
At least you can all
stay in school together.

73
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,367
You got your dream job.

74
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,567
Yes. I'll be working in the IT industry.

75
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:42,167
My intention is to work hard
and find the best man out there.

76
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,267
I want to avenge myself.

77
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,700
Here comes your best man
carrying a bouquet of roses.

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,867
Out of the question!

79
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:07,067
Naoki.

80
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,133
Thanks to you, I enjoyed college life.

81
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,133
Become a good doctor, okay?

82
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,367
Thanks.

83
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,067
Miss Aihara.

84
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,633
I had fun with you, too.
Don't hold Naoki back, okay?

85
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,100
I hope you make a good wife.

86
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:47,233
Thank you! And good luck in IT!

87
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,533
See you.

88
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,000
Hey, Matsumoto!

89
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:05,033
Congratulations on
joining the ranks of society!

90
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,667
There's nothing between us now.

91
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,267
This is for you.

92
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:18,500
That's very nice of you,
but I have a party to attend.

93
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,933
Matsumoto! I'm going with you!

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,967
Matsumoto! Wait for me!

95
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:41,133
Kinnosuke will never
have feelings for me.

96
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:45,933
Kotoko... you're still his only love.

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,433
That's not true.
He's just embarrassed.

98
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,067
I'm sure he thinks about you.

99
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,967
Oh, Kotoko.

100
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
I...

101
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,500
have to return to England.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,900
What?

103
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,833
But...

104
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:10,300
if Kinnosuke asked me to stay...

105
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
I...

106
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:17,967
I...

107
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,133
Chris...

108
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,133
What? A birthday party?

109
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,633
You've never had one before!

110
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,233
So, we decided to throw you one.

111
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,833
But my birthday is December 29th.

112
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,667
That was three months ago.

113
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,867
Oh, yeah... You're right.

114
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:47,267
But it's the three-month anniversary
of your birthday!

115
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:52,333
That's so embarrassing.
I feel like a VIP.

116
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,867
That's it! VIP! VIP! VIP!

117
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,500
Really? Okay.

118
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,933
If you want to throw me a party,

119
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,800
I'd be glad to attend.

120
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,133
Yes!

121
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,867
Happy birthday, Kin-chan!

122
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,033
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

123
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,667
You're 22 years old!

124
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:24,033
A long journey. How time flies!

125
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,700
Which is it?

126
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,867
But in my case...

127
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:33,300
I only get better with time.
Not to brag, but...

128
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,133
Okay, it's time to light the candles.

129
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,067
Wow! What a huge cake!

130
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,700
Chris made it with TLC.

131
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,333
Oh, is that right?

132
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,767
Do you like it, Kinnosuke?

133
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm not really into sweets.

134
00:10:56,467 --> 00:11:01,133
And these English cakes
are kind of over the top.

135
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,733
Kin-chan!

136
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,467
Wow! What a feast!

137
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,800
-Right?
-Go on, eat up!

138
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,500
Thank you.

139
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:28,233
Delicious! Did you make the meat
and potatoes, Kotoko?

140
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,067
Nope. Chris made it.

141
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:35,033
Is it good, Kinnosuke?
I'm so happy!

142
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:39,500
Maybe it was a fluke.
Let me try the other dishes.

143
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,233
Here I go.

144
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,267
Oh, my God! This is terrible!
What is this?

145
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,533
See? This is more like it.

146
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,667
Kin-chan. I made that.

147
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:58,767
What?

148
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,533
You should appreciate Chris.

149
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,500
She dedicated these past six months

150
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,133
to becoming a traditional
Japanese girl for you.

151
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,100
Kinnosuke... here.

152
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:15,033
It's your birthday present. Open it.

153
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,533
Wow! A sweater!

154
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,867
It says, "Kin!"

155
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,433
And I made a matching one.

156
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,467
It says, "Kuri!"

157
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,633
I'm not that good at knitting,

158
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:40,833
so it took me a while, but...

159
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,467
I put my heart and soul into it.

160
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,567
They're amazing!

161
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:52,367
Maybe I'll try knitting one for Naoki.
Chris, teach me!

162
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not a good knitter!

163
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,767
But it's made with lots of love.

164
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,267
Did you hear that? Love!

165
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,633
Kin-chan's embarrassed.

166
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,567
Oh, my God!

167
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,033
Just say you're happy!

168
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,200
Shut up!

169
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:15,533
Kin-chan...?

170
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,667
I've said it a hundred times.

171
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:22,533
I love Kotoko. She's my only love.

172
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,100
I don't have any feelings for you.

173
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,467
Kinnosuke...

174
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,633
What is this?

175
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,700
Who would wear such a lame sweater?

176
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,700
You...

177
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,467
should hurry up
and go home to England!

178
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,300
Fine!

179
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,900
Chris...

180
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,000
Your wish will come true.

181
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,533
I'm going home.

182
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,467
What is she so mad about?
How stupid.

183
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,833
You're stupid!

184
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,867
Chris is leaving! Don't you care?

185
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,167
You're overreacting.

186
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:26,633
She's going home to England!
Next week!

187
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,333
Chris didn't want to leave.

188
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,067
She tried so hard to win your heart.

189
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,533
You may not feel the same way,

190
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,733
but you didn't have to be so hurtful!

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
You're terrible.

192
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,633
You all came.

193
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,733
Thanks!

194
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,300
You've taken such good care of me.

195
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,200
Chris!

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,133
Chris.

197
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,000
Take care!

198
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,167
Kotoko, I'll miss you.

199
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,033
What are you doing?

200
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,233
Sorry!

201
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,633
What's going on, Kinnosuke?

202
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,333
You're so fidgety today.

203
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,933
I know why!

204
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,600
Chris hasn't been here lately.

205
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,133
I guess she gave up on you.

206
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,600
We haven't seen her for a while.
She used to come every day.

207
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,767
I kind of miss her.

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,933
Huh?

209
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,867
Boss, aren't you a little
too old for her?

210
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:54,067
Idiot! She's like a daughter to me.

211
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,067
She...

212
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:57,967
She's leaving.

213
00:15:58,633 --> 00:15:59,467
Leaving?

214
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,900
Boss!

215
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,167
Boss...

216
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,067
Sorry, but I need to go!

217
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,333
-Go where, Kinnosuke?
-Hey, Kinnosuke!

218
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,500
We're super busy today.

219
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Hey! Put away the dishes!

220
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,267
Damn it.

221
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,233
Damn it!

222
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,200
I promise to write!

223
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,733
It's almost time.

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,233
Can't we wait just a little longer?

225
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,800
I think Kin-chan will be here soon.

226
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,900
It's okay, Kotoko. I'll be fine.

227
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Kotoko, you really did a good job.

228
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:49,867
But what if

229
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,800
he's on the Narita Express now?
Just a little longer.

230
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you, Kotoko. But I give up.

231
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,100
But... But...

232
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,367
Thanks to Kinnosuke,

233
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,933
I had so much fun in Japan.
Will you tell him that?

234
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,200
Chris.

235
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,567
See you!

236
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,367
I'm going! Bye!

237
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,167
Chris!

238
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:32,867
But to be honest,
I was hoping he'd come.

239
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,800
I wanted to...

240
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,400
see him for one last time.

241
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:44,833
Bye-bye.

242
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,167
Chris.

243
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,533
He didn't come.

244
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's go home.

245
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,300
Chris!

246
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,167
Chris!

247
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,133
Kin-chan?

248
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,800
Kotoko? Where's Chris?

249
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,933
Kin-chan, Chris is...

250
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:38,300
In the bathroom?
Is she in the bathroom?

251
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,500
You came, Kin-chan.

252
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,633
So, you really do care.

253
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,533
But Chris is already...

254
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,500
Kotoko...

255
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,067
Sorry!

256
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,267
Kin-chan...

257
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,600
Chris!

258
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,367
Where are you?

259
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:04,867
Chris!

260
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,033
I came for you!

261
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,933
Come back!

262
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:16,400
You're too late. She already left.

263
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Really?

264
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,133
Chris!

265
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,467
Idiot.

266
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,800
Why didn't you wait for me?

267
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,433
I came here for you.

268
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I wore this lame sweater for you.

269
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,567
I went all the way home to get it.

270
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,567
Look at me!

271
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,667
Kin-chan.

272
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,967
If he came a little earlier...

273
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
He's too late.

274
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:10,967
I'm starting...

275
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,567
to like you a little bit.

276
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,633
Stay in Japan, Chris.

277
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,100
Is that true?

278
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:24,133
Yes! So, come back!

279
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,100
Chris...

280
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,567
Hi, Kinnosuke.

281
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,033
If that is your wish.

282
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,433
Chris?

283
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,300
But, Chris, your plane.

284
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,867
Oh, the plane. I first got on...

285
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,400
but right before it took off,

286
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:54,433
I saw a glimpse of
Kinnosuke's face and...

287
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,833
Oh, Kinnosuke. I'm so happy!

288
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:04,233
You wore my sweater. I'm so happy!

289
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,733
I meant to return it to you.
Don't be silly.

290
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,867
Kinnosuke!

291
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,967
Wait, wait, wait. Chris!

292
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,533
Kotoko. Help me, Kotoko!

293
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,633
What's the problem?

294
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:21,900
That's enough! Get off me!

295
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:27,267
<i>I think spring has arrived</i>
<i>for Kinnosuke.</i>

296
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,667
What is this? A fashion show?

297
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,633
Actually, I'm going
on a date with Naoki!

298
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,933
Oh, how nice!

299
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,167
Come to think of it,

300
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,200
you've never been
on a real date with Naoki.

301
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,000
That's right.

302
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,100
Congratulations, Kotoko!

303
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,200
Before the nursing exam, Naoki said:

304
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:17,733
"If you pass the test,
I'll take you out on a date."

305
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:21,000
That's what he said!

306
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,167
Sin(theta) = minus the root of 16/25.

307
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,467
So, this becomes minus 4/5.

308
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:30,300
Therefore, the tangent(theta)...

309
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,967
What?

310
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,633
Naoki...

311
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,667
What is it?

312
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:40,167
If I pass the test,
will you take me on a date?

313
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,600
What are you thinking?

314
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:48,667
I'll be way more motivated
if there's a reward in sight.

315
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:52,500
And we've never been
on a real date.

316
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,233
We're always together.

317
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,833
But we've never gone out on a date.

318
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,033
We went to Odaiba.

319
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,700
I was following you and
Matsumoto on your date.

320
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:06,100
That's right! You took
Matsumoto on a date!

321
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,533
But not your beloved wife.
Isn't that strange?

322
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,967
I want to know what it's like
to go on a date with you!

323
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,300
Please, please...

324
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,833
All right! All right.
So, get back to your study.

325
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Really?

326
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,633
Yes! I'm going to do it!

327
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,400
Memorize what?

328
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,767
I said...

329
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:33,233
I'm so proud of Naoki!

330
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,767
We've been so busy.
It's been hard to find a free day.

331
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,333
But it's tomorrow!

332
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,733
-Tomorrow?
-Yes!

333
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,633
So, you were choosing a date dress.

334
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,533
Yes!

335
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,567
How fun!

336
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:53,400
My heart is fluttering!

337
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:56,133
Mine, too!

338
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,900
Thank goodness you passed the test.

339
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:03,967
Naoki will be a doctor
and I will be a nurse.

340
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm one step closer to my dream.

341
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,533
How wonderful!

342
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,067
You must have studied very hard.

343
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:16,400
It wasn't that bad. Actually...

344
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,400
it was quite easy.

345
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,000
Really?

346
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,567
Naoki!

347
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,500
Oh, Naoki.

348
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,033
Quite easy?

349
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,667
Well...

350
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,400
Welcome home, Naoki.

351
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:43,867
Naoki, speaking of our date...

352
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,867
Ta-da!

353
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,500
What is this?

354
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,733
I stayed up all night making this.

355
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:57,833
I hope our date tomorrow
will follow this itinerary.

356
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:02,933
All night? Good job, Kotoko!

357
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,933
Naoki is such a lucky guy.

358
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,767
You should be using your time
to study nursing instead.

359
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,067
Oh, my.

360
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,767
It's a secret. Top secret.

361
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,033
-Good morning, Naoki.
-Morning.

362
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,967
Naoki, you're still here?

363
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,300
Still here?

364
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,600
Your date is today.

365
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:39,333
What are you still doing here?
Kotoko already left!

366
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:42,400
We're supposed to meet at noon.

367
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:49,733
Oh, it's a little early, then.

368
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,067
Her head is in the clouds.

369
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:55,433
What is she thinking?
Leaving so early...

370
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,200
I don't get it.

371
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:00,767
Why should we meet somewhere
when we live in the same house?

372
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:17,467
Yes! The best spot!

373
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,500
Let me review the itinerary.

374
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:36,033
<i>Eleven-thirty a.m.</i>

375
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,800
<i>Naoki arrives at our meeting spot</i>
<i>30 minutes ahead of time.</i>

376
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,767
I'm way too early.

377
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,867
<i>Naoki is waiting for me.</i>
<i>He looks a bit nervous.</i>

378
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,300
<i>Twelve-o-five p.m.</i>

379
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:10,667
<i>I arrive just a few minutes late!</i>

380
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,600
Sorry. Did you wait long?

381
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,033
No, I just got here.

382
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,867
I'm really sorry.

383
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,967
You're here now.
That's all that matters.

384
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:46,700
Naoki.

385
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:08,500
This is it. This is it!

386
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Okay!

387
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:16,600
I wish he'd hurry up.

388
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,767
He knows it's today, right?

389
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,700
He never picks up his phone.

390
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,167
What if something happened?

391
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:52,200
An accident? Oh, no!

392
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,767
If something happens to him, I'll...

393
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,367
What are you doing here?

394
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,533
Naoki!

395
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,633
We're meeting on the bridge, right?

396
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,833
Naoki, thank God you're safe!

397
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,367
<i>I can't let on that I was</i>
<i>watching from here!</i>

398
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,867
Did you just arrive?
What a coincidence!

399
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:19,900
Why...

400
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,867
did you leave the house
two hours early to hide here?

401
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,367
I'm busted.

402
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,833
It was you who told me to be here
at the bridge at noon.

403
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,033
I don't get it.

404
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
-Well...
-Let's go.

405
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,500
<i>Not a very good start.</i>

406
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,733
<i>No! Our date is only beginning!</i>

407
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,700
<i>Our dream date. Let's go!</i>

408
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,133
I prefer an action film.

409
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,333
I already bought our tickets.

410
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,033
Ta-da!

411
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:58,767
<i>Eternal Love.</i> It's supposed
to be so romantic!

412
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,467
Naoki...

413
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,567
Here are our seats.

414
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,367
<i>Is he going to...</i>

415
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,900
<i>hold my hand?</i>

416
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,700
Naoki...

417
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,000
Kotoko.

418
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,033
Wake up.

419
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:51,200
But, Naoki...

420
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,033
The movie's over.

421
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,100
Let's go.

422
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:18,467
I wanted to enjoy
the beautiful outdoors with you.

423
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,967
I heard that couples that
ride the boats in this park--

424
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,167
Let's ride the boat, Naoki!

425
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,333
Hurry!

426
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,000
Hurry!

427
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,833
Excuse me. Can we rent a boat?

428
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,433
That will be 400 yen.

429
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,867
-Okay.
-Wait a minute, Kotoko.

430
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,233
I'm going to buy some drinks.

431
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,267
Now?

432
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,500
We can drink them on the boat.

433
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,433
Sorry. I'll be right back.

434
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,433
Okay.

435
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,267
Naoki!

436
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:23,000
Where is Naoki? How far did he go?

437
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,000
Kazuhiko, what's wrong?

438
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,500
Are you okay? Are you okay?

439
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,733
Kazuhiko... are you okay?

440
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,000
What's wrong? Kazuhiko!

441
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,767
-Kazuhiko...
-What's wrong?

442
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,033
My son... he suddenly...

443
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,033
Are you all right?

444
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:51,367
He can't breathe!
Can I loosen his buttons?

445
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:53,000
-Yes.
-Okay.

446
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,100
-Are you okay?
-Kazuhiko...

447
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,367
-Kotoko!
-Naoki!

448
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,200
What happened?

449
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,333
I don't know.

450
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,567
He started coughing
and couldn't stop.

451
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:11,500
Does your son have asthma?

452
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:12,833
I don't think so.

453
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,967
Let's lay him down on the bench.

454
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:17,767
He'll breathe easier
if he's sitting up.

455
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,700
Hold him up like this.

456
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:23,733
-Call an ambulance.
-Okay.

457
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,467
Can you suck on this?

458
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:37,267
Hello? A 5-year-old
is having trouble breathing.

459
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,100
You'll feel better.

460
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Do you? Kazuhiko!

461
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,767
Breathe in.

462
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:54,467
Breathe out.

463
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:08,167
I want to play basketball next year.

464
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:10,300
You'll have to work hard, then.

465
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,867
Okay!

466
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Thank you so much.

467
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,500
How is he?

468
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:32,467
The doctor is with him now.
His condition is stable.

469
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:36,200
I don't know how to thank you.

470
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,533
Not at all.

471
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,800
The doctor said it's a good thing
we brought him in quickly.

472
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,500
That's good...

473
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,433
What did he say it was?

474
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,300
He thinks it's bronchial asthma.

475
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:48,567
I see.

476
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:53,933
He's been coughing a lot lately.
I thought it was a cold...

477
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,833
Asthma is sometimes
triggered by a cold.

478
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,600
It's easy to control with medication.

479
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,600
It's a very treatable condition,

480
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:08,200
so, don't worry too much.

481
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,967
Oh... okay.

482
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:14,433
He's going to be a doctor.

483
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,100
Oh, is that why?

484
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,167
Thank you very much.

485
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,000
I was a bit shocked just now.

486
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,133
What?

487
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:41,033
You're usually so cool, but you
really empathized with his mom.

488
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,467
Of course.

489
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:47,733
I know, but...

490
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,800
But...

491
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,167
What?

492
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,833
You...

493
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:01,667
were like a real doctor.

494
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:05,300
Idiot.

495
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,233
There are a lot of sick kids,
aren't there?

496
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,300
Yeah.

497
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,333
But...

498
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:23,267
when you become a doctor,
you can help them.

499
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:25,833
It's not that easy.

500
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,100
When you become a doctor,

501
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:32,233
you'll save many children's lives.

502
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,233
You'd better hurry up.

503
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:44,267
You'd better become a nurse, too.

504
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:49,300
Don't worry! I'll be
a bona fide nurse in three years.

505
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,400
You have to pass a national exam
to become a nurse, you know.

506
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,600
Another test?

507
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,167
Wait, Naoki.

508
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:13,033
You were a pretty good nurse today.

509
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,767
They're already closed.

510
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:31,600
Yeah.

511
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,833
Oh, it's you!

512
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,267
Is it too late to rent a boat?

513
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,967
He saw everything, didn't he?

514
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,333
He let us take the boat
because we helped that boy.

515
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Yeah.

516
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,667
This is a little different
from the date I imagined.

517
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,900
I had all these grand plans in my head

518
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:20,900
but it's no fun when things go
exactly as planned.

519
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,933
As long as I can be with you...

520
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
I'm happy.

521
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:29,967
What?

522
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:33,133
Didn't you know?

523
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:38,133
Couples who ride these boats
are fated to part ways.

524
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,500
What?

525
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,800
The goddess of this park...

526
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:46,700
is a jealous spirit that
likes to break couples up.

527
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,700
-Oh, my God!
-Don't stand up!

528
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,500
You mean you knew that?

529
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,967
What do you want to do?
We're on the boat already.

530
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:03,467
Why didn't you tell me
before we got on?

531
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,967
I would never have...

532
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:14,267
This is the kind of date
you envisioned, right?

533
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,767
You and me, on a boat.

534
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,667
Naoki, how did you...?

535
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:22,233
What else?

536
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,633
Holding hands at the movies.

537
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,733
Me arriving 30 minutes early.

538
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:33,867
Naoki, did you know everything?

539
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,700
I wonder.

540
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,767
I can't believe it!

541
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:42,400
When did you read my plan?

542
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:48,300
I'd never agree on a date
exactly as you planned it,

543
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,400
but you stayed up
all night planning it out.

544
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,367
The least I could do was
make part of it come true.

545
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,400
What do you want to do?

546
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:02,400
Believe in a stupid jinx
and get off the boat?

547
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:05,933
Naoki...

548
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,200
Or...?

549
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,133
