1
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,900
I passed!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,967
Yes!

3
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,633
Congratulations!

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:16,233
<i>Naoki, I want you to be the first</i>
<i>to see me...</i>

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,233
<i>as a nurse!</i>

6
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:28,967
I wanted to tell you
the minute I found out.

7
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:35,500
We can finally work together.

8
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:41,167
You studied hard all year.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,100
Naoki!

10
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:53,567
You look good in that uniform.

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,500
Thanks.

12
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:04,900
{\an8}4 MONTHS LATER

13
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,400
Hi, everyone.

14
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,367
No!

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,067
It's Kotoko!

16
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,367
What do you mean by "No!"
as you see me coming?

17
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,833
What are you trying to do?

18
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,433
To take a blood sample.

19
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:35,100
Oh, God. From... From who?

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,133
Mr. Harada and Mr. Kimura.

21
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,900
It's me!

22
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,267
Come on. Let's do it.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,200
You have no idea what it's all about
since you joined us here today.

24
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,100
-What a treat for your first day here.
-What?

25
00:01:55,967 --> 00:02:00,967
That nurse is named Kotoko Irie.
You'd better watch out for her.

26
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:04,133
Just watch.

27
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,600
Are you afraid of a little shot?

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,167
You're just like a kid.

29
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,633
Give me your arm, please.
Do you prefer right or left?

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,967
Don't screw it up.

31
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:22,367
Leave it to me.
Let's start with the tourniquet.

32
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,400
Squeeze your thumb tightly, please.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,133
Okay, now.

34
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,200
Let's make those veins pop.

35
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,667
Ouch! Ouch!

36
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,600
Now some rubbing alcohol.

37
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,100
Okay.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,033
It'll feel a little cold.

39
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,833
Okay.

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,467
Now, this may sting a little.

41
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:00,867
That's weird. Blood isn't coming out.

42
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,433
Don't worry.

43
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,667
Narrow veins perhaps? That's strange.

44
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,433
Okay.

45
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,900
Wait a minute, please.

46
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,500
Okay.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Okay. Let's try again.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,567
What?

49
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,133
Something's not right...

50
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,067
This usually doesn't happen.

51
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,100
One last time.

52
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,267
My arm will be full of holes!

53
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,500
What are you doing, Ms. Irie?

54
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,100
Nurse Shimizu.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
Let me do it.

56
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,367
Thank God.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,267
Mr. Kimura was a rare example.

58
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,300
How about Mr. Harada?

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,633
Please, don't! No!

60
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,433
Wait, Mr. Harada!

61
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,867
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

62
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,133
{\an8}FLOWERS AND STORMS

63
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,367
{\an8}Out of the question!

64
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:19,133
How long have you been a nurse now,
Ms. Irie?

65
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,433
Two... Two months.

66
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,400
I told you to call someone
after failing two tries.

67
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,133
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,967
You're not a trainee anymore.

69
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,967
And yesterday, you also did...

70
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,633
That's my patient calling.

71
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,167
How can I help you?

72
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:44,467
What? Okay. Got it.

73
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,400
I have to run, Nurse Shimizu.

74
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,033
Mrs. Irie!

75
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:54,633
She's only so quick
when she needs to be.

76
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,867
Take care.

77
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,500
Kotoko.

78
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,500
Moto-chan.

79
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,567
Nurse Shimizu chewed you out again?

80
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,933
Cheer up.

81
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,300
You must be used to
getting scolded by now.

82
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:21,700
It's not that.

83
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,767
I worked so hard to become a nurse.

84
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:29,567
I thought I could finally
work with Naoki.

85
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,433
I cried tears of joy.

86
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,067
But look what happened!

87
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,067
They told me there were
no vacancies in Kobe.

88
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,367
Could that be possible?

89
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:47,400
Naoki and I are still apart.
I can't believe it!

90
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,433
How could I be happy?

91
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,067
I guess...

92
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,167
divorce may just be a matter of time.

93
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,800
Stop it!

94
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,800
It can't be helped.

95
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:04,333
At least you were assigned
to Tonan University Hospital.

96
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,633
I guess.

97
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:11,333
Marina and Funatsu ended up together
in the Cardiovascular Unit.

98
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,000
Tomoko is in Surgery Unit 2,
of course.

99
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,033
Keita is in Orthopedics.

100
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:20,867
And you and I are in Surgery Unit 3.
We're all here except...

101
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,667
Naoki isn't here!

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,233
<i>When will I ever get</i>
<i>to work with Naoki?</i>

103
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:36,167
<i>I thought I could finally</i>
<i>become a help for him.</i>

104
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,600
<i>God is so unfair.</i>

105
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,433
Ms. Irie.

106
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,700
You look depressed.
Did you mess up again?

107
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,833
Dr. Nishigaki.

108
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,633
This nurse here...

109
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:02,600
...turned her patient's arm
into a pin cushion.

110
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,767
That's not necessary.

111
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,433
How terrible.

112
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:14,700
I'll teach you how to give injections.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
Maybe during a night shift?

114
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,667
No, thank you.

115
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,600
How about a date, then?

116
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,200
Dr. Nishigaki!

117
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,700
I'll have you know
I'm a married woman.

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,233
So I heard.

119
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,333
You don't look it, at all.

120
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,033
I heard your husband
is a very capable intern.

121
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,433
Is he better looking than me?

122
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,233
Of course.

123
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,167
That's hard to believe.

124
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:47,800
But if he's not here,
he's not a rival, is he?

125
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,967
If you get lonely without him,

126
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,900
don't hesitate to call on me.

127
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,633
-I will not!
-I will.

128
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,800
How about lunch, Dr. Nishigaki?

129
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,967
Oh, Ms. Tanaka.

130
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,300
Sure.

131
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,467
New hairstyle?

132
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,333
You noticed.

133
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,733
Of course I did.

134
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,933
I never miss one single change
in a beautiful woman.

135
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,333
You look fantastic.

136
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:23,067
Really? You're such a flirt.

137
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,733
It's gonna be a long lunch.

138
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:31,867
What a player. He gives me the chills.

139
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:35,667
But Dr. Nishigaki is good-looking.

140
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,767
I would fall for him.

141
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:44,733
What do you mean?
He's such a player.

142
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,333
And he's a brilliant surgeon.

143
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:51,267
He's 29 and single.

144
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:56,333
I need eye candy. Especially
since Mr. Irie is not around.

145
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,267
Don't you agree?

146
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,500
Not at all.

147
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,700
Okay, you're right. He is good-looking.

148
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,467
And he might be a good doctor, too.
But...

149
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,867
But! He's totally different from Naoki!

150
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,167
Naoki is a doctor of principle.
He would never be tempted

151
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,300
by a sexy nurse or a patient.

152
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,933
Not even by you.

153
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:21,167
Speaking of not being
tempted by women,

154
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,600
Dr. Daijamori is principled, too.

155
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:31,533
Please. Don't even try to compare them.

156
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:34,233
That doctor isn't...

157
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,067
What?

158
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,733
I'm supposed to take...

159
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,267
Dr. Daijamori's patient
to the MRI Room at 11:00.

160
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:51,267
He'll blow up even if you're
a minute late. He's such a stickler.

161
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,867
And the time is...

162
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,033
It's 11:15.

163
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,700
No!

164
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,933
Ms. Irie! No running in the halls!

165
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,667
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,867
Hey!

167
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:28,033
I heard from Nurse Shimizu
that we have a problem.

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,500
In just one day, we've had claims
from Dr. Ezaki and Dr. Daijamori,

169
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,400
and even from patients.

170
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,767
You're making too many
fundamental errors.

171
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:40,967
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,567
Ms. Irie.

173
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:47,400
You submitted a request to be
transferred to the hospital in Kobe.

174
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,033
-Yes.
-Because your husband...

175
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,033
Dr. Irie is working there?

176
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,100
Yes. I...

177
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:59,333
I want to work with Dr. Irie.

178
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,667
That's all very well.

179
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,867
I believe married couples
should be together.

180
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,867
But! Do you think you're ready?

181
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:15,900
Dr. Irie has been so brilliant
ever since when he was a medical student.

182
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,600
He must be making his marks over there
right now.

183
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,067
You want to be a good partner
to Dr. Irie, right?

184
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes.

185
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:30,000
But as it stands, you will not only
make a poor partner...

186
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:34,033
You will be a burden on Dr. Irie!

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>A burden... on Naoki.</i>

188
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,167
You know...

189
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,133
What's wrong, Kotoko?

190
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,533
We haven't seen you in a while.
Why are you so down?

191
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,833
Really, Kotoko. What happened?

192
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,833
You finally became a nurse.

193
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,667
I was looking forward to

194
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,233
being nursed back to health
by Nurse Kotoko.

195
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,167
I'll take care of you, Kinnosuke.

196
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,233
-Idiot, that was my fantasy.
-Well, discard that fantasy.

197
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,767
-What for?
-I can be a nurse, too.

198
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,167
-You can?
-I can.

199
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,733
-Prove it.
-Okay.

200
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,867
You two get along so well.

201
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,367
Why don't you get married?

202
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah. Tell him that, Kotoko.

203
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,833
Let go of me.

204
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,933
You can work together...

205
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,033
and be together forever.

206
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,133
I'm so envious.

207
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,967
You miss Irie. Is that it?

208
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,667
It's not good to be apart
from the man you love.

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,567
I gave up going home to England.

210
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,200
You're right.

211
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:12,733
To be honest,
I want to be with Naoki every day.

212
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:18,033
But they say I'm not ready.

213
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:22,900
I'll just be a burden on Naoki.

214
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,133
They're right.

215
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,467
I mess up all the time.

216
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,100
I've been a burden on doctors
and patients all the time.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,867
They're scared of me.

218
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,700
At this rate...

219
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,067
I won't be able to assist Naoki.

220
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,700
I'll just get in his way.

221
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,067
-Kotoko--
-No, Kotoko.

222
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,600
Don't be so negative.

223
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:05,133
Where is the Kotoko that inspired me
in matters of love?

224
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,833
The Kotoko I know
is not weak and negative.

225
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,333
The Kotoko I know...

226
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:17,067
would trample over flowers and storms
to pursue Naoki.

227
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,067
That's the real Kotoko.

228
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:22,700
-Flowers and storms?
-Yes.

229
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,167
-Trample over?
-That's right.

230
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,900
You're right.

231
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,233
All I can do is try my best
to overcome my challenges.

232
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:42,833
If I just stand still,
I'll never reach Naoki.

233
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,900
That's the spirit, Kotoko.

234
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,067
-Chris.
-That's the real Kotoko.

235
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,133
I'll do it.

236
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,567
You're so resilient.

237
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:08,767
<i>Trample over flowers and storms.</i>

238
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:20,100
Mr. Yokoi's IV is done.
I'm going to distribute the lunches.

239
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,567
Oh, okay. Thanks.

240
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,600
Did you change Mr. Yamagishi's sheets
in Room 203?

241
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,733
-I'll do it right now.
-I did it already.

242
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,067
What?

243
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,467
I'll be going now.

244
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,500
What's come over Ms. Irie?

245
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,833
Who knows?

246
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,033
Do you have a dream?

247
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,833
-For the future?
-Well...

248
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:56,300
As for me, my husband is a doctor,
so, that's why I became a nurse.

249
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,900
-Dear God, dear God.
-It'll just be a little prick.

250
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,433
Dear God, dear God.

251
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,533
Mr. Hasebe in 216 complained
of post-surgical pain at 1:00 p.m.

252
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,633
I gave him an IV drip.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,667
Okay.

254
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,567
Excuse me.

255
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,500
There you are, Ms. Irie.

256
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,567
I'm sorry. Did I mess up again?

257
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:39,933
No. This time, it's good news.

258
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,533
There's a vacancy.

259
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,167
We heard back from Dr. Irie's
hospital in Kobe.

260
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,267
Let's get the paperwork done
for the transfer.

261
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,033
I'm sure you want to go right away.

262
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,033
Me? At Naoki's hospital?

263
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:03,133
Yes! You endured
a long, long separation.

264
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,333
And you've shown
great improvement lately.

265
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,367
Please keep it up and support Dr. Irie.

266
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:14,967
Thank you, Nurse Hosoi!

267
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,600
Hospital in Kobe?

268
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,133
So, you're leaving us.

269
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,233
Maybe we'll all live a little longer.

270
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,433
Hey.

271
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,833
But we'll miss you.

272
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,800
And your loud voice.

273
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,100
Good luck with your husband.

274
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,267
And injections.

275
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,633
I'll miss you all, too.

276
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,333
There you are, Ms. Irie.

277
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,400
We're doing our rounds.

278
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,967
Oh, yes.

279
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,767
Let's take a look at your scar.

280
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,667
Thank you.

281
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,767
-It's healing very well.
-That's good.

282
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,367
-Minimal scarring.
-Good.

283
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,633
Alcohol.

284
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,733
<i>I have to tell Naoki.</i>

285
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,767
<i>Is he gonna be surprised?</i>

286
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,833
Alcohol.

287
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:26,900
Alcohol!

288
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,633
Oh, yes.

289
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,633
Sorry.

290
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,700
Stop daydreaming.

291
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:41,233
Who are you to say?
You're only an intern.

292
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,333
What...? What are you doing here?

293
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:55,200
I've been transferred to Tonan
University Hospital Sugery Unit 3.

294
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,833
I'm Naoki Irie. How do you do?

295
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,467
Irie...?

296
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,967
Are you Kotoko's...?

297
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:06,667
Then...

298
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,300
Naoki, that means you and I...

299
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,233
Can finally work together.

300
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,300
Kotoko.

301
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,100
Naoki!

302
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,267
<i>We've come such a long way.</i>

303
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,733
<i>Memories flash through my mind.</i>

304
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,433
I...

305
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,333
What I want to do most...

306
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:41,033
is to help you do your job.

307
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,467
In other words, to become a nurse.

308
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,333
<i>Naoki is here.</i>

309
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,467
<i>This is exactly what I've been dreaming of</i>
<i>all this time.</i>

310
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,933
--committed to my care.

311
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm thinking of working
at a hospital in Kobe.

312
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,867
<i>It's been so long.</i>

313
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,200
Hey. We're in a hospital.

314
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,567
Is that your husband?

315
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:30,933
Yes. This is my husband.

316
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,800
Good for you.

317
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,067
Yes.

318
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:44,033
From today, he and I
will take care of you all.

319
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:47,867
But aren't you going to Kobe?

320
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:54,067
So, we're going to be apart again.

321
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:59,333
-No.
-I guess it wasn't meant to be.

322
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,867
Well, do your best in Kobe.

323
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:07,500
Are you done?
Let's continue our rounds.

324
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:17,833
Nurse Hosoi!
Please cancel my transfer!

325
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:28,367
I'm home.

326
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,633
Ready?

327
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,467
Welcome home, Naoki!

328
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,300
This is wonderful.

329
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,100
It's been so long. Right, Kotoko?

330
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,233
Yes.

331
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,667
Naoki.

332
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:01,300
You left Kotoko all alone
for a long, long time.

333
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,967
Please take good care of her
from now on.

334
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,567
Do you hear me?

335
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,067
Mom.

336
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,267
Naoki is back home.

337
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,500
Now our family is all together.

338
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,900
The two of you, and our family,
will all be happy.

339
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

340
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,733
Let's have a toast. Over there.

341
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,733
And don't forget about my grandchild.

342
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,200
Tonight is Naoki's
welcome-home party.

343
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,500
Drink up.

344
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,033
Thank you.

345
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,400
I'm sure I'll be very busy,

346
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,000
but Kotoko and I will do our best.

347
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,133
Okay.

348
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,867
Well, Naoki, welcome home.

349
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,367
Cheers!

350
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,900
Cheers!

351
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,833
Now for the food. Let's go get it.

352
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,300
Welcome home, Naoki.

353
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,633
You've grown up, Yuki.

354
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,000
Really?

355
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:14,367
He's already grown
10 centimeters this year.

356
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:17,433
Good thing you're taller than Konomi.

357
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:18,800
Shut up, Kotoko.

358
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,833
Why? I'm happy for you.

359
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,400
Sorry, but...

360
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,900
Naoki.

361
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,733
Welcome home.

362
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,000
Thank you for letting me come today.

363
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:33,467
How is school going, Konomi?

364
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:38,367
I'm still struggling.
Yuki gets mad at me all the time.

365
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,800
Are you and Yuki getting along?

366
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,267
He still tutors me.
We go to the movies, too.

367
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,633
With Yuki, huh?

368
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,700
What are you telling my brother?

369
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,300
Hey, Kotoko. We're here.

370
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,433
Naoki. Welcome home.

371
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,067
Let's eat.

372
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,933
My glasses are slipping.

373
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:12,933
So, you're a teenager, huh?

374
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,767
Kin-chan.

375
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,367
-What?
-The monkey...

376
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:17,667
You did this.

377
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,500
You'll catch cold, Naoki.

378
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:35,567
Are you tired?

379
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,867
Everyone's having a great time.

380
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:44,233
My life in Kobe was so quiet.

381
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,600
Living alone...

382
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,667
Everyone's so happy you're back.

383
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,700
They can't help but celebrate.

384
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,867
Mom, Dad, even Yuki.

385
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,500
He talks big, but even Kin-chan.

386
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,133
My Kobe transfer has been canceled.

387
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,167
Now we can finally live together.

388
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm so very happy.

389
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,633
It's so noisy back here.

390
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,867
I really feel like I'm home.

391
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,833
I'm home.

392
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,067
Welcome home, Naoki.

393
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,033
Now we'll be together forever.

394
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:15,000
Mr. Kimura in 215 is going to have
an intestinal polyp removed tomorrow.

395
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,533
-Okay.
-Mr. Yokoi's stiches come out today.

396
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,833
-Okay.
-So cool.

397
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:25,833
<i>I could look at him</i>
<i>in his doctor's coat all day.</i>

398
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:30,367
I'm so happy.

399
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,133
You'd better watch out.

400
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,767
I think I underestimated him.

401
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,200
Dr. Nishigaki, you're Naoki's...

402
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,067
Dr. Irie's medical advisor.

403
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:46,567
How can an intern be more popular
than his advisor?

404
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,267
-That's not the issue.
-Dr. Irie.

405
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,233
How was Mr. Ito in 202?

406
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:57,467
I was watching his progress on primperan,
but his condition hasn't improved.

407
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:01,500
And? Then what?

408
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,833
How should we proceed?

409
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:07,533
We should identify which side
of the intestine we should resect

410
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,133
by using an enema.

411
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,733
You're spot on.

412
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,600
It's no fun being your medical advisor.

413
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,167
Kotoko. He'll cheat on you in a minute
and make you miserable.

414
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:27,067
You should break up with him
while you can.

415
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,367
Then...

416
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,967
you can go out with me, huh?

417
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:37,800
Dr. Nishigaki.

418
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:39,967
Dr. Nishigaki.

419
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,133
This is Mr. Tsuda's pre-op chart.

420
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,433
You can't even take a joke.

421
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:50,433
You're assisting in Unit 2. Be ready.

422
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:51,667
Yes, doctor.

423
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,167
I'm back.

424
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:57,633
Ms. Irie!

425
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,267
Where have you been all this time?

426
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:05,333
You've been slipping again
since Dr. Irie has been back.

427
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,167
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,967
I don't know if you're ready
for this responsibility.

429
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:10,933
What?

430
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:15,467
From today, you'll be assisting
in actual procedures.

431
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,600
-What?
-This is your first time, right?

432
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:22,200
It's a simple procedure today.
Don't worry, I'll be there, too.

433
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,500
Yes.

434
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:28,800
<i>Assisting. Could it be?</i>

435
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:32,267
You're assisting in Unit 2. Be ready.

436
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:33,933
<i>Yes.</i>

437
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:38,433
<i>My first time as an assisting nurse.</i>

438
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:43,167
<i>I might work with Naoki.</i>

439
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,767
Do you know what you're
supposed to do?

440
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,600
Be sure to review it.

441
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,933
Nurse Shimizu?

442
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,567
Who's the attending doctor?

443
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,533
Doctor...

444
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,733
What are you doing here?

445
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
My name is Irie. I'll be assisting.

446
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,467
Give me a break.
Is she going to be of any use?

447
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,667
Okay, let's start.

448
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,500
We have a very risky assistant today.

449
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,333
So, be extra careful.

450
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:32,767
Please keep the sanitized and
unsanitized instruments separate.

451
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:36,567
-Yes, doctor.
-Yes, doctor.

452
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:41,100
<i>I can't screw it up.</i>

453
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,600
<i>I practiced this a hundred times</i>
<i>during training.</i>

454
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,900
<i>I'll surprise Dr. Daijamori.</i>

455
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,467
<i>I can do it, Naoki.</i>

456
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:57,867
Scapel.

457
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,100
Yes.

458
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,800
<i>Oh, no.</i>

459
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,267
<i>I'm starting to sweat.</i>

460
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:18,967
<i>Gross.</i>

461
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:24,533
-Gauze.
-Yes.

462
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,567
Why are you wiping yourself?

463
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:35,733
Give me the gauze.

464
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,333
Oh, sorry.

465
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:53,067
<i>No. Don't faint.</i>

466
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,367
-Pean.
-Yes.

467
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,167
-Hurry up. Pean.
-Yes.

468
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,167
I got it. Here you go.

469
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:20,933
You...

470
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:25,400
You caused another commotion?

471
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,933
I... I'm sorry!

472
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,733
The procedure was completed
and Dr. Daijamori's injury

473
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,100
turned out to be minor, but seriously...

474
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,933
This was another fundamental error
on your part.

475
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,767
I guess you weren't ready.

476
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,233
It was my mistake.

477
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,300
Night shift?

478
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,233
You're on night duty, too.

479
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,967
Yeah.

480
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,267
You want some caffeine?

481
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,867
Yes.

482
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,500
I...

483
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,467
The stabbing incident?

484
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,700
I heard you made a grand debut.

485
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,933
I'm so depressed.

486
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,833
I injured the hand of a surgeon.
It can't get any worse.

487
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:14,467
I could have placed
a patient's life at risk.

488
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:18,133
My own carelessness scares me.

489
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,100
I don't want to be a burden on you.

490
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,867
So...

491
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:32,800
I'll be sad if we're
in different departments, but...

492
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:38,567
I thought I'd request a transfer
to another area.

493
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,800
Like dermatology or ENT.

494
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:49,000
I'd better go. Thanks.

495
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:54,767
This is Irie.

496
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,867
I see. I'll be right there.

497
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,300
An emergency?

498
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,367
Three people were in a car accident.

499
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:06,700
Three people?

500
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:10,233
No other hospital would take them.
I'd better go.

501
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,967
I'm coming, too.

502
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:21,867
Dr. Irie, take this patient to the ward.

503
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,100
He's stable now.
I'll see him after I operate.

504
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,633
-It's a femoral compound fracture.
-Yes, doctor.

505
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,133
Let me know if anything happens.
I'm counting on you.

506
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,333
Yes.

507
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:47,333
I guess he's going to be fine.

508
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:56,067
Why is his blood pressure dropping?

509
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,233
It might be a ruptured femoral artery.

510
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,467
Kotoko, call Dr. Nishigaki!

511
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:08,433
Okay.

512
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,900
Dr. Nishigaki.

513
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,000
The patient's blood pressure
is in the 50s!

514
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,633
His femoral artery...

515
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:25,667
What...?

516
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:29,333
Dr. Nishigaki! Hello? Hello?

517
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,967
He said to wait. He can't leave
the operating room right now.

518
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:40,067
It's too risky to wait.

519
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,900
But...

520
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:44,333
The artery needs to be sewn up.

521
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:46,800
I'll do it.

522
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,667
But, Naoki, you're just an intern!

523
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:53,167
-Dr. Nishigaki told us to wait.
-We don't have time.

524
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:56,933
But there will be consequences.

525
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,367
I'll take responsibility.

526
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:02,867
-No. Let's wait for Dr. Nishigaki.
-Kotoko.

527
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,167
-Kotoko.
-Yes.

528
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,133
Put on a gown, now.

529
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:12,000
Assist me.

530
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,000
But, I... I can't.

531
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:21,167
I'll mess up again and you'll be...

532
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:24,033
Are you going to abandon this patient?

533
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,300
But...

534
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:28,167
If you don't do this now,
you'll never move forward.

535
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,533
If you can live with that,

536
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,200
go to dermatology or ENT
or wherever you want.

537
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,167
Forget it. I'll call another nurse.

538
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:45,700
Wait!

539
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:52,300
I'll assist you.
I want to save this patient.

540
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,233
Good for you.

541
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,467
<i>I'll be assisting Naoki.</i>

542
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,133
<i>I'm not scared.</i>

543
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,433
<i>Not at all.</i>

544
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,233
<i>Naoki must be scared.</i>

545
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,133
<i>With no attending doctor...</i>

546
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,033
<i>The fiasco with Dr. Daijamori</i>
<i>is still fresh in my mind.</i>

547
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,867
<i>But I have to support Naoki.</i>

548
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,067
<i>I can't be a burden.</i>

549
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,000
-Scalpel.
-Yes.

550
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,767
-Gauze.
-Yes.

551
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:17,767
<i>If anything goes wrong</i>
<i>because of me...</i>

552
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,333
<i>I'm scared.</i>

553
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:23,133
<i>Everything will fall</i>
<i>on Naoki's shoulders.</i>

554
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,900
-Tweezers.
-Yes.

555
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,533
-Kotoko, vitals.
-Yes.

556
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,200
Blood pressure 50-30. Heart rate 300.

557
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,467
You mean 160?

558
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,300
-Forceps.
-Yes.

559
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,533
<i>I have to be strong.</i>
<i>I can't be a burden.</i>

560
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,633
-Forceps.
-Yes.

561
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,300
I'm sorry.

562
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,967
<i>My mind blows up. I can't think.</i>

563
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,233
<i>The patient, Naoki...</i>
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

564
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,833
<i>What should I do?</i>

565
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,533
NEXT EPISODE

Get up.

<i>-Just listen to me.</i>
<i>-What are you doing?</i>

568
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,133
<i>I decided to do it. Kotoko, go.</i>

569
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
<i>I can't let her do this by herself.</i>

570
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:06,433
Forceps. I'm closing it up.
Prepare the saline.

571
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,567
It is unprecedented.

572
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:10,667
Who will take responsibility?

573
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,633
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-I don't.

574
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,533
<i>Why are you acting like my girlfriend</i>
<i>when you're not?</i>

575
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,667
Sorry.
