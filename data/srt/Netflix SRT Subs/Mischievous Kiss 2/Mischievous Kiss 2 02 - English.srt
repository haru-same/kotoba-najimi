1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,267
We're really married!

2
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:08,500
On your honeymoon?

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,267
Naoki-san!

4
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,700
<i>What's with the "Naoki-san!"?</i>

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,867
Sorry very much.

6
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,967
Those people look familiar...

7
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,000
Say "Cheese!"

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,333
Naoki-san!

9
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,500
Hurry, Naoki-san!

10
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:36,767
<i>Why is she pestering us</i>
<i>day after day?</i>

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
It hurts!

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,533
Where does it hurt?

13
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,367
Don't touch her, Naoki!

14
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,267
Don't touch another woman!

15
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,967
That's enough!

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,433
You married a man
that's going to become a doctor.

17
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>I'm so terrible...</i>

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,067
<i>I thought I understood Irie-kun's</i>
<i>ambition to become a doctor.</i>

19
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,667
You're so cold.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,233
I don't blame you,
with Kotoko as your wife.

21
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,167
I bet you don't even love her.

22
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:15,733
If I met you a hundred times,

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,133
I'd ignore you every single time!

24
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,833
I was worried about you.

25
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,867
That was fun!

26
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,467
Let's go again someday.

27
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:35,500
Yeah, someday.

28
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,800
Next time, we'll be all alone and...

29
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:42,967
Naoki-san!

30
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,000
Mr. Kanamori...

31
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,800
What are you doing here?

32
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,733
I came to fetch you.

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,667
Did something happen at work
while my dad was away?

34
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,033
Your father was away?

35
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,900
It's not for me to say.

36
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,867
Where are we going, Mr. Kanamori?

37
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,967
We'll be there shortly.

38
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,333
Please go in.

39
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,333
Where are we?

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,000
Please.

41
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,433
Welcome home!

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,200
Come in, Naoki!

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,033
You, too, Kotoko! Come in!

44
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,633
Thanks, Kanamori.

45
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,633
You must be exhausted from your trip.

46
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,067
-You, too, Mom.
-What?

47
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,433
This house...

49
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:42,000
This is our new home for both families!

50
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,867
Our old house

51
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:50,100
would have been too small
once the babies arrive.

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,333
So we took the plunge
and built a new one!

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,533
We'll be staying with the Irie's again.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
Guess what. I have my own room!

55
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,700
It's too early to think about kids.

56
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:05,800
Anyways...

57
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,633
What is this?

58
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,133
How embarrassing! I love it!

59
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,233
Is this Okinawa? How did you...?

60
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,700
Still don't get it?

61
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,933
These people followed us to Okinawa.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,367
What?!

63
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:33,167
The blond people...

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,967
...that were hugging!

65
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,500
Take it down.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,167
I know how you feel, Naoki,
but it's a nice photo.

67
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:56,467
You're a good photographer, Mrs. Irie.

68
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,533
Thanks!

69
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,700
She took enough photos.

70
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:04,900
Take it down! What will people think?

71
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:09,633
They'll think you have a happy marriage.

72
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,200
This is the living room. Like it?

73
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,233
It's so spacious!

74
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,300
Look, Kotoko! Look!

75
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,033
Come on, everyone! This way!

76
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:34,200
Ta-da! This is the kitchen!

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,300
Come on in!

78
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,500
This is your bedroom.

79
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,767
What a gorgeous bed!

80
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,667
And this is the nursery.

81
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,200
Like it?

82
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,667
Lovely! Adorable!

83
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,400
<i>It's true.</i>

84
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,400
<i>Me and my dream guy, Naoki Irie,</i>

85
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,867
<i>are married.</i>

86
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:04,067
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

87
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,300
{\an8}MY MARRIAGE STILL ON HOLD?!

88
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,800
Okay...

89
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm up...

90
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,133
<i>It's my first day as a wife.</i>

91
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,633
<i>My beloved husband is next to me.</i>

92
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,567
<i>Naoki is still fast asleep.</i>

93
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:50,400
<i>From now on, I can see</i>
<i>his adorable face every morning...</i>

94
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:54,233
I'm so happy!

95
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,367
<i>And for my perfect husband,</i>

96
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:03,133
<i>I'll make the perfect breakfast!</i>

97
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,333
<i>A traditional Japanese breakfast</i>

98
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,267
<i>of miso soup with tofu, grilled fish</i>
<i>and a rolled egg omelet.</i>

99
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,533
<i>That sounds good.</i>

100
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,667
<i>Oh, yes. And fermented soy beans.</i>

101
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,700
<i>Then I'll see him to the door and...</i>

102
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,700
Wait! What?

103
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,867
Oh, my God!

104
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,233
Good morning, Kotoko.

105
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,833
You didn't have to get up.

106
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,267
I... I'm sorry.

107
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,700
Never mind. It's fine.

108
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:26,600
First the wedding, then the honeymoon.

109
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
You must be exhausted.

110
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,233
If you know what I mean.

111
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,367
What an useless bride.

112
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,633
My poor brother

113
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,367
married a sloth.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,100
He must be regretting it.

115
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,367
I'm sorry...

116
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,467
By the way, where is he?

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Who knows? He's gone to work.

118
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,833
What? No way!

119
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,633
Naoki!

120
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,033
Thank God you're still here.

121
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,267
Good morning.

122
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,433
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,800
The alarm clock went off so early.

124
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,600
I was looking forward
to a nice breakfast.

125
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,500
Married life...

126
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,033
What a good wife I have.

127
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,167
I... I...

128
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,867
I promise. Tomorrow...

129
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm kidding.
I don't expect anything from you.

130
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,633
That's kind of depressing...

131
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm going.

132
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,800
Wait a minute, Naoki.

133
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:51,400
Aren't you forgetting
something important?

134
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:52,800
What?

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,267
A kiss when your new bride
sees you off!

136
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,600
How can I?
With a camera in my face?

137
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,267
Will you do it without the camera?

138
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,667
Give me a break!

139
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,833
We'll decide how to live our lives.
Leave us alone.

140
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:15,967
If you think you can do it all
on your own, you're mistaken.

141
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,200
You seem to be forgetting

142
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,533
the most important thing
in a new marriage.

143
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:28,600
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

144
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:33,933
We took care of that
on our honeymoon...

145
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,967
Registering your marriage!

146
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,767
You forgot, right?

147
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,833
I can't believe it.

148
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,233
You still haven't gone
to the ward office...

149
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,500
How could you have forgotten?

150
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,733
You mean it's not official?

151
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:53,233
We're not legally married?

152
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,367
That's right.

153
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:59,967
So my name is still Kotoko Aihara?

154
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,833
We have to go to the ward office
right away and...!

155
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,600
No need to panic, Kotoko.

156
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,267
Look! Registration forms!

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,400
And in case you make a mistake...

158
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:17,700
I got multiple copies!

159
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,033
I've already signed them as your witness.

160
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,800
Wow, so many... Thank you.

161
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,567
Thanks, but...

162
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,700
I'm not ready to register our marriage.

163
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:33,500
I have to think about it.

164
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:36,533
I'm putting it off for now.

165
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,400
B... but Naoki! Wait!

166
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,900
That's not acceptable!

167
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,033
Yo!

168
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,700
If it isn't the newlywed, Kotoko!

169
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,067
How's married life?

170
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,833
Don't fool around too much now...

171
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:07,533
Who thought you'd actually
rope Irie into marriage?

172
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:11,600
It's a miracle. There's hope
for me and Matsumoto!

173
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,900
You're no longer Kotoko Aihara.
You're Mrs. Irie.

174
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,533
I'm still...

175
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:21,867
...Aihara.

176
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,967
What was that?

177
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,733
I'm still Kotoko Aihara.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,567
What? Still Kotoko Aihara?

179
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,700
You're so loud!

180
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
But didn't you get married?
I went to your wedding.

181
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,500
I went to your wedding.

182
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,900
It's not registered yet.

183
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,467
Are you saying Irie doesn't
want to make it official?

184
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,433
I don't understand Naoki at all.

185
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:56,300
What are you men thinking?

186
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,633
Calm down, Aihara. No, Irie?
Aihara? Irie?

187
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,833
He wants to avoid a messy divorce.

188
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,567
Matsumoto.

189
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,533
He thinks of everything, doesn't he?

190
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,667
What?

191
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:13,200
In other words, you're on probation.

192
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,733
If he deems you unfit as a bride,
he'll leave you.

193
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,733
N... no way!

194
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,400
I guess that means
I still have a chance.

195
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,100
Right, Miss Aihara?

196
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:32,567
Hey... Hey, Matsumoto!

197
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,267
<i>It's the reception desk.</i>
<i>There are people here</i>

198
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,700
<i>who claim to be your friends.</i>

199
00:15:58,967 --> 00:15:59,900
Who are they?

200
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,367
<i>They won't say. They said</i>
<i>you'll know them when you see them.</i>

201
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:04,700
Never mind, then.

202
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
<i>Okay! I'll tell you!</i>
<i>It's Aoki from Tonan University.</i>

203
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,000
Aoki? Who's Aoki?

204
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:13,867
Whatever.

205
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,533
Let them through.

206
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm Aoki from the Anime Club.

207
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,867
I'm Akagi.

208
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,933
I'm Kimura.

209
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:22,600
Anime Club?

210
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,133
That's right.

211
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,767
What does the Anime Club want with me?

212
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,100
We were totally shocked!

213
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,333
You're the President-to-be of Pandai!

214
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,367
Right?

215
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:38,500
Actually, we created something

216
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,800
that will greatly benefit your firm!

217
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,100
A masterpiece 18 months in the making!

218
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:46,400
Wanna see it?

219
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,233
Not really.

220
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:53,533
But you'll want it so badly,
you can taste it!

221
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:57,400
Yeah! We heard you married
Kotoko Aihara.

222
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,200
What is it?

223
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,633
Wanna see it?

224
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,167
Fine. I'll take a look.
If you promise to leave afterwards.

225
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,367
Yes!

226
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:20,100
Tennis warrior Koto-rin!

227
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,967
What is this? A computer game?

228
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,700
Bingo!

229
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,300
You're brilliant!

230
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,033
See? Isn't Koto-rin adorable?

231
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,800
Not really.

232
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,167
-Koto-rin?
-Bingo!

233
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,300
Hello? Naoki?

234
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,067
<i>Kotoko?</i>

235
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,033
What happened? Busy at work?

236
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,567
<i>I won't be coming home tonight.</i>

237
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,333
<i>I won't be coming home for a while.</i>

238
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,900
NEXT NIGHT

239
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,767
<i>He didn't come home the next night...</i>

240
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,133
2 NIGHTS LATER

241
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,800
<i>Or the next night...</i>

242
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,300
3 NIGHTS LATER

243
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,333
Damn!

244
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,733
<i>...and the next night...</i>

245
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,333
<i>He didn't come home.</i>

246
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,567
Naoki...

247
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,167
There! Done!

248
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,867
Hi there, Naoki...

249
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,167
I love you!

250
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,400
Excuse me.

251
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,467
Yes?

252
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm here to see the secretary
to the president, Naoki Irie.

253
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,733
Let me check.

254
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,800
Thanks.

255
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:44,033
And you are?

256
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,333
His wi...

257
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,400
You can tell him it's Kotoko.

258
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,867
Miss Kotoko?

259
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:54,933
Yes.

260
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,167
<i>How pitiful.</i>

261
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:03,033
<i>I can't even say I'm his wife.</i>

262
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:18,067
<i>You brought me lunch?</i>
<i>How thoughtful of you.</i>

263
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,267
<i>Come. Let me give you a hug.</i>

264
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,833
<i>Naoki!</i>

265
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,600
You're such a good wife.

266
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,667
Let's go register our marriage.

267
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,600
<i>Miss? Miss!</i>

268
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Yes?

269
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,767
I'm very sorry, but Mr. Irie
can't see you now.

270
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:56,200
Sorry. I can deliver your package
to him, though.

271
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,600
Yes, please.

272
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,667
Okay.

273
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,800
He refused to see you?

274
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,133
That's bad.

275
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:19,400
You haven't registered your marriage
and he hasn't been home in two weeks?

276
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,033
And he refused to see you?

277
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,567
It doesn't sound work-related to me.

278
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,833
Could it be... another woman?

279
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:31,833
Hold on, Jinko!

280
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,800
Is it true?

281
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,467
Kin-chan!

282
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,767
You haven't registered your marriage?

283
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,267
Irie hasn't been coming home?

284
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,333
Is he making you miserable?

285
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,267
Well...

286
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,433
I'm sure there are reasons.

287
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:53,467
Where are you going?

288
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:54,633
Are you kidding?

289
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,833
I'm going to clobber him!

290
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,333
Hold on, Kin-chan!

291
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,467
<i>Irie! Where are you?</i>

292
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,733
Irie! Where are you?

293
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,567
Where's Irie?

294
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,333
Come out, you!

295
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,033
Irie!

296
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,933
What's all this noise?

297
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,767
You... What are you doing here?

298
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,233
Why haven't you registered
your marriage?

299
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:29,167
Why aren't you going home?
Why are you avoiding her?

300
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:32,900
Are you preparing to break up with her?

301
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:36,400
I... was ready...

302
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:39,467
to keep my mouth shut
as long as she was happy.

303
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,933
I entrusted Kotoko to you.
Or so I thought!

304
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,067
But you're already making her cry!

305
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:52,667
Do what you want,
but don't play with her heart!

306
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,433
This is between Kotoko and me.

307
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:00,467
Stay out of it.

308
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,600
What?

309
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:09,967
How many times do you
have to make her cry?

310
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,367
Hey you! Cut it out!

311
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,333
Let go of me!

312
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,600
Wait! Wait!

313
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,800
Kotoko...

314
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,733
He's not at fault. You are!

315
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,500
You don't think of me as your wife!

316
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,467
I'm the only one who gets excited.

317
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm the only one who feels insecure.

318
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,833
This isn't a marriage!

319
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,567
Then leave.

320
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,833
It's not official yet anyway.

321
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,167
How can you say that?

322
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,700
Hey! Kotoko!

323
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,333
I guess she needs me.

324
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,100
I win!

325
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,133
Kotoko!

326
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:20,767
Kotoko.

327
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,333
Aren't you supposed to be at home?

328
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,833
It's time to make dinner
for your husband.

329
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,133
It's fine.

330
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:37,467
Naoki isn't coming home.
There's nothing for me to do.

331
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Kotoko...

332
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:47,233
Big-mouth Kinnosuke
told me what happened.

333
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,233
I'm not telling you not to fight.

334
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,367
But...

335
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,133
A man's workplace is a battlefield.

336
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,767
You go to his office and pick a fight

337
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:05,500
just because he's working hard
and not able to come home?

338
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,200
That's no reason

339
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,667
for a wife to demean her husband.
It's pitiful.

340
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:17,800
Stop thinking only of yourself.
Put yourself in his shoes.

341
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:23,167
Excuse me, boss, but Kotoko
is not the one to blame.

342
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:24,667
Kinnosuke!

343
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,733
It's Irie's fault.

344
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:30,467
You should have seen him.
I'm so disgusted.

345
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:33,900
Stay out of it! This is between
a man and his wife.

346
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,300
But boss!

347
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Shut up and go back to work!

348
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,067
Come on, Kinnosuke.

349
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,100
Yes, sir.

350
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,067
But...

351
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,633
try to understand Kotoko's feelings, too.

352
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,300
Naoki must have his reasons.

353
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,567
You should believe in him.

354
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:19,367
If you don't, who will?

355
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,267
Hey, Aihara!

356
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:44,700
Stop daydreaming! Say something...

357
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,267
Say something, damn it!

358
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,133
<i>I believe in him...</i>

359
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,933
<i>I believe in Naoki.</i>

360
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,767
<i>But I want to see him.</i>

361
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,867
<i>I want to see you, Naoki.</i>

362
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,033
Kotoko!

363
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,933
Kotoko!

364
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:28,767
Naoki!

365
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,333
Naoki? It's him!

366
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,333
Come here, Kotoko!

367
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,667
We need to go. Hurry!

368
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:39,267
Okay. But I need to change first.

369
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,467
Never mind. Come as you are. Hurry!

370
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:45,067
Okay!

371
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,433
What happened, Naoki?

372
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,167
Naoki...

373
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,500
Naoki?

374
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,167
Where are we going?

375
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:10,500
You'll see.

376
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,400
Everything is ready.

377
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,167
Okay. Let's get started.

378
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,367
Prepare to begin.

379
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,533
They're here, everyone.

380
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,100
Mr. Naoki Irie has arrived!

381
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,467
What?

382
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,967
First, a statement from Mr. Irie.

383
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,500
Kotoko, wait here.

384
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,800
This press conference

385
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,833
will be streamed live globally
over the Internet.

386
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,967
Hey! Kotoko!

387
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,300
Kotoko!

388
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,433
Dad!

389
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,833
I'm glad you made it in time.

390
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,900
What's going on? What is this?

391
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,367
Naoki hasn't told you anything?

392
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,067
Members of the media,

393
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,633
thank you for coming. I'm holding
this press conference to announce

394
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,133
Pandai's new online game.

395
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,367
{\an8}I'm Naoki Irie, in charge of design.

396
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,000
Mr. Irie, you're a trendsetter
in this industry...

397
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,667
Naoki was designing an online game

398
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,633
that Pandai is going to distribute.

399
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,633
-An online game?
-Right.

400
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,367
It would normally take months...

401
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,433
No, over a year to complete.

402
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,367
But a small team put it together
in a matter of weeks.

403
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,033
It's quite an accomplishment.

404
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:18,533
He was up all night, every night
to complete it.

405
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,133
I'm surprised he's still standing.

406
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:24,700
He didn't wanna have to rush.

407
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,300
What's more,

408
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,333
I told him to contact you
and invite you here.

409
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:38,700
He insisted on going to get you...

410
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,100
himself!

411
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,000
-Really?
-Yes!

412
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,833
Naoki...

413
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:49,533
And now, I'd like to introduce
the design team and title character.

414
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,333
The title character was designed by
the Anime Club of Tonan University!

415
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,367
Whoa! It's the seniors!

416
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,200
We love you, Koto-rin!

417
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,067
-Koto-rin?
-What?

418
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,500
What's that?

419
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,367
The title of the new game is
"Tennis Warrior Koto-rin"!

420
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,833
Koto-rin...?

421
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,033
It's Koto-rin!

422
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,333
Oh, my God...

423
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,767
What? What is it?

424
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,367
And now, the inspiration
for Koto-rin herself!

425
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,133
Koto-rin a.k.a. Miss Kotoko!

426
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,433
It's Kotoko!

427
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:58,167
It's Kotoko!

428
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,500
What? Kotoko?

429
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,000
What? It's Kotoko? Why?!

430
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,267
Miss Kotoko, please come forward.

431
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Yes!

432
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,667
Thank you...

433
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:31,667
I'd like to introduce my wife,
Kotoko Irie.

434
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,667
Say something.

435
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,233
Okay...

436
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm...

437
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,233
Kotoko.

438
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:00,800
I'm honored to be

439
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,667
the wife of this very smart man.

440
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,267
Thank you very much.

441
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:13,633
Was that weird?

442
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:17,367
Yes.

443
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,533
Kotoko.

444
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,500
Long time, no see.

445
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,533
Naoki!

446
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,533
<i>It was embarrassing...</i>

447
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:03,933
<i>But I was really, really happy!</i>

448
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,167
Are these new?

449
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,533
Sorry! I bought new ones.

450
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:42,467
Why?

451
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,067
I used the old ones to make this.

452
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,967
Because... you didn't
come home for a while.

453
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,700
I was lonely.

454
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:00,300
This is you.

455
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,633
Looking at it cheered me up.

456
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,567
I quit my job today.

457
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,967
Really?

458
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:15,000
I still have to train my successor
but I'll be back at school next month.

459
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,500
So you can study to be a doctor?

460
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:19,800
Finally.

461
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,067
That's great!

462
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,933
Do you think that game will be a hit?

463
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,733
Of course.

464
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,433
I ate your omelet,
complete with eggshells.

465
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,800
What? Eggshells?

466
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:41,267
I'm so sorry.

467
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,933
I missed you, Naoki.

468
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,967
Sweet dreams.

469
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,067
1 MONTH LATER

470
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,433
<i>Look! Look!</i>

471
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,667
Naoki's game is in the paper!

472
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,100
What?

473
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:49,133
Oh, my gosh! Koto-rin is a huge hit!

474
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,700
"Unprecedented level
of excitement and realism!"

475
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,767
He did it!

476
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:58,900
Let's go.

477
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Okay!

478
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:09,500
That's right!
Naoki is going back to school today.

479
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,400
Have a nice day!

480
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:17,133
Thank you!

481
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,400
I need to make a stop first.

482
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:34,633
The ward office?

483
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,300
Naoki.

484
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,533
What's that?

485
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,033
Now it's your turn.

486
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,433
Okay!

487
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,733
Don't mess up.

488
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,467
Okay...

489
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,100
Hey.

490
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,733
Why did you write "Irie"?

491
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,167
You mean I'm not Kotoko Irie yet?

492
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,333
I should have known...

493
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,767
Mom is always prepared
for these things.

494
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,667
That's fine.

495
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,433
Can you fill in this part, Mrs. Irie?

496
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,633
Mrs... Irie?

497
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:56,233
This part here.

498
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:58,733
Mrs...?

499
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:01,333
Mrs...

500
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,067
Mrs...

501
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,433
Hey!

502
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:15,133
Now... I'm finally officially your wife.

503
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,300
I knew you'd be anxious,

504
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,900
but, as a man,

505
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:30,833
I wanted to get my dad's
company back on its feet

506
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,600
before we got married.

507
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,667
But then my mom

508
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:41,400
went ahead and arranged
the wedding reception and all.

509
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:45,400
It ended up taking a long time.

510
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:51,133
It was fine. Because I believed in you.

511
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,467
But you came barging
into my office with Kinnosuke.

512
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,833
That was...

513
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,500
But now you're my wife.

514
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:13,600
<i>And now you're my husband, Naoki!</i>

515
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:17,633
Wait for me, Naoki!

516
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,333
As of today, I'm finally Kotoko Irie!

517

Kotoko, you're pregnant!

522

00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:18,400
<i>Have you seen a doctor?</i>

526
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,900
Not yet, but mom said...
