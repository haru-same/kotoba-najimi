1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,100
Take this patient to the ward.

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:05,633
-It's a femoral compound fracture.
-Yes, doctor.

3
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:07,333
Dr. Nishigaki!

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,800
He said to wait.

5
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:11,933
It's too risky to wait.

6
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,767
But...

7
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,100
The artery needs to be sewn up.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,867
<i>I have to be strong.</i>
<i>I can't be a burden.</i>

9
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,167
Forceps.

10
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:23,967
Yes.

11
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,833
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,233
<i>My mind is blanking out.</i>

13
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:42,633
<i>The patient, Naoki... It's all my fault.</i>

14
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,033
<i>What should I do?</i>

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,400
Hey.

16
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:54,400
Stand up.

17
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,133
I can't use my hands.

18
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,067
What are you scared of?

19
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,633
Aren't you scared?

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Of course not.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,333
Listen. I studied this for years.
I'm totally confident.

22
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:30,633
I'm probably better than Dr. Nishigaki.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,933
This patient is lucky.

24
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:39,333
I would never allow your little mishaps
to endanger his life.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,033
Just listen to me.

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,933
Okay.

27
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,900
Then go wash up
and pick up those instruments.

28
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,433
Yes.

29
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,333
What are you doing?

30
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,667
Nurse Shimizu.

31
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,533
Dr. Irie, do you have
Dr. Nishigaki's permission?

32
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,933
-No.
-What?

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,367
His condition deteriorated suddenly.
I needed to act quickly.

34
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:14,267
Dr. Nishigaki is operating now.
He couldn't leave.

35
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,500
-I decided to do it.
-You decide...?

36
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,000
-Kotoko, go.
-Yes.

37
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,333
Ms. Irie.

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,033
Fine. But I can't let her
do this by herself.

39
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:38,633
I'm going to assist you, too.
Tell me what I can do.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,367
Thank you.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,667
<i>I can breathe again.</i>
<i>I can see clearly now.</i>

42
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,200
Okay. I'm fine now.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,133
-Forceps.
-Yes.

44
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,367
-Scissors.
-Yes.

45
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,500
-Suture 6.0.
-Yes.

46
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,467
<i>Everything went</i>
<i>so smoothly after that.</i>

47
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,200
<i>Naoki was so sure of himself.</i>

48
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,233
-Prepare the saline.
-Yes.

49
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,133
<i>Even Nurse Shimizu,</i>
<i>who was uncertain at first,</i>

50
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,733
<i>seemed to trust him.</i>

51
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,633
<i>This was only</i>
<i>my second time assisting,</i>

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,733
<i>but Naoki's words</i>
<i>were so full of confidence</i>

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,633
<i>that I knew he was right.</i>

54
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,300
<i>You can do it, Naoki.</i>

55
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:17,933
Okay.

56
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,900
-Gauze.
-Yes.

57
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,400
It's done.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,500
Yes.

59
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,200
-You did it.
-Dr. Irie.

60
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,900
Thank you. You did a wonderful job.

61
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,167
Thank you.

62
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,700
Can you check the operating room?

63
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,633
Yes.

64
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,900
Naoki.

65
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:59,133
The patient's surgery
went smoothly, too.

66
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,700
Good.

67
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:06,500
Naoki.

68
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,300
I'm so glad it went well.

69
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,933
Your judgment and skills
saved his life.

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,333
You were amazing.

71
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,567
I was so happy.

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,667
If...

73
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,600
you didn't...

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,700
knock my head,
I may have run away.

75
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,500
I was petrified.

76
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,267
I didn't know what to do.

77
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,533
Naoki?

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,667
Me, too.

79
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,600
I...

80
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,300
was scared, too.

81
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,933
But you... were so confident.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,900
That was for your benefit.
Your mind went blank, right?

83
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,067
That was my first emergency.

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm surprised.

85
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,567
At what?

86
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,000
That you get scared, too.

87
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,933
I'm glad...

88
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,200
that the patient made it.

89
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:53,133
I'm glad you became a doctor.

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,467
Yeah.

91
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,400
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

92
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:06,433
CONFERENCE ROOM

93
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,000
{\an8}It is unprecedented

94
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,400
{\an8}STAND UP FOR LOVE

95
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,700
{\an8}for an intern to perform
a procedure without guidance.

96
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,367
It was unthinkable
when I was an intern.

97
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,400
It's unthinkable now.

98
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,567
Dr. Nishigaki is Dr. Irie's advisor.

99
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,200
Yes.

100
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:32,567
I understand Dr. Irie
is a very capable intern.

101
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,367
But even still...

102
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,833
Luckily, this time...

103
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,367
the procedure was successful.

104
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,867
If something had gone wrong,

105
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,300
the responsibility would have been
too large for an individual to bear.

106
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:58,400
Once a precedent like this is set,

107
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,700
we expose ourselves to great risk.

108
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:06,400
Confidence is not always good.

109
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,167
Right, Dr. Nishigaki?

110
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:16,467
If I had been Dr. Irie's medical advisor,

111
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:20,133
this would have never happened.

112
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,333
In any case, this is not a simple
problem we're dealing with.

113
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,667
Who will take responsibility?

114
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,533
What kind of problem is it?

115
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:36,533
I became a doctor
to save patients' lives.

116
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,800
-Hey.
-Rules don't apply in this case.

117
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,700
The patient's life was in danger.

118
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,233
Dr. Nishigaki was
performing another surgery.

119
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:56,200
I had to do it. That's all.

120
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:59,033
But you should have
respected Dr. Nishigaki's...

121
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,900
His patient was in critical condition.

122
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,433
He needed to remain focused.

123
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:09,433
I was confident I could save the patient.

124
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,200
So, I performed the procedure.

125
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:17,100
If someone needs
to take responsibility,

126
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,033
you don't have to talk
through my advisor.

127
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,633
You can talk directly to me.

128
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,667
What an ego this intern has.

129
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,200
Dr. Nishigaki.

130
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:35,200
What have you been teaching him?

131
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,233
In that case,

132
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:43,200
we'll have to let Dr. Irie
take responsibility.

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,033
Naoki is an amazing doctor.

134
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,033
You're saying, "intern this"
and "intern that,"

135
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,800
as if interns are helpless little chicks.

136
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,467
How impertinent.

137
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:04,600
Naoki's confidence
is supported by his actions.

138
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,633
He may have broken some rules,

139
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,500
but in that moment,

140
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,133
all Naoki cared about
was saving a patient's life.

141
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,167
That patient is alive because of Naoki.

142
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,633
He still has a life ahead of him.

143
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,367
Doctors...

144
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,100
Doctors... are amazing.

145
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:42,067
Ms. Irie! What did you do now?

146
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm sorry, doctors.

147
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,900
This is preposterous.

148
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:52,900
Who is this girl, Nurse Shimizu?

149
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,833
She's out of line.

150
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,933
But, doctors...

151
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,667
I also assisted Dr. Irie
in the procedure.

152
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,333
I have assisted many surgeries.

153
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,800
Dr. Irie's work was that of
a capable surgeon.

154
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,433
If not for him, that patient...

155
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,400
Nurse Shimizu...

156
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,200
The patient is recovering well.

157
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,033
That's all I wanted to report.

158
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,100
So...

159
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,833
Excuse us.

160
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,633
Let's go, Ms. Irie.

161
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,767
Excuse me.

162
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,767
So...

163
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:47,700
What do you think, Dr. Nishigaki?

164
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,133
Well...

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,600
He may have acted rashly.

166
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:00,867
But...

167
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,767
There were many challenges that night.

168
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,467
That patient could have easily died.

169
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,633
But he survived.

170
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:16,600
So, I cannot refute Dr. Irie's actions.

171
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:21,933
I wouldn't have done that
as an intern, though.

172
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,767
I see.

173
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,467
Well, shall we leave it at that, doctors?

174
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,067
-But, professor.
-The precedent...

175
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,567
Dr. Irie.

176
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:44,800
I commend you on your judgment
and skills at such a young age.

177
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:50,167
But a doctor and patient
must trust each other.

178
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,200
Patients don't see interns
as full doctors.

179
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,133
We must avoid
making them feel insecure.

180
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,700
Do you understand?

181
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,967
Yes.

182
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,767
Okay. Then we're finished.

183
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,900
Dr. Nishigaki, please write up
an incident report.

184
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,333
It's your responsibility as his advisor.

185
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,100
Yes.

186
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:33,600
My record was impeccable.

187
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,967
Now it's marred because of
an overly confident intern.

188
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,900
Shall I write the report for you?

189
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,733
Shut up!

190
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,367
Act more like a humble intern.

191
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,033
And write up the report.

192
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,033
No, wait. I'll do it.

193
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,400
They'll chew me out again.

194
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,367
Watch out.

195
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,433
Are you Konomi Sagawa?
Sorry to approach you like this.

196
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,567
Yes.

197
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,833
It's Konomi. Konomi!

198
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:18,933
What?

199
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,533
This guy wants to talk to you.

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,433
I go to West High School
by the station.

201
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,100
I saw you walking by.
Right near here.

202
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,067
Who are those guys?

203
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,533
Shut up. Be quiet.

204
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,033
Oh, sorry.

205
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:46,867
I see you on the train every day.

206
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,100
I think you're cute.
You've been on my mind lately.

207
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:54,967
So...

208
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,900
Will you go out with me?

209
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,833
You go to Tonan High, right?

210
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,400
It's nearby.

211
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,767
Will you see me sometime?

212
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,667
I know he's my friend,
but he's a really good guy.

213
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,600
But...

214
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,367
Oh, my God.

215
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,833
He's asking Konomi out.
What are you going to do?

216
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,300
What am I going to...?

217
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:26,533
Do you...

218
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Do you have a boyfriend?

219
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,933
-A boyfriend.
-You're so cute.

220
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:35,167
Do you have a boyfriend?

221
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,233
A boyfriend?

222
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,533
Tell him. Tell him, Konomi.

223
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,267
Tell him you have a boyfriend
named Yuki Irie.

224
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:44,300
Hey.

225
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,733
I don't.

226
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes!

227
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,433
So, will you go out with him?

228
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,667
He's really nice.

229
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,833
Start off by texting.

230
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,933
But...

231
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,667
What?

233
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,967
Really.

234
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,133
Wait. Just your number,
or e-mail address.

236
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,267
Konomi is so popular.

237
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,267
Right, Yuki?

238
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,300
Yuki?

239
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,967
I'm going home.

240
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,967
Wait. Yuki.

241
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,967
First, you loop the yarn around
and pull it tight.

242
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,867
Right. So, pull it through.

243
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:42,733
That's it. Don't get it tangled.

244
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,233
Pull.

245
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,967
That's not exactly right.

246
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:54,333
Will I make it in time for Valentine's?

247
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,767
You can do it. Try again.

248
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:02,600
Another knitting student
for Valentine's Day.

249
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,933
She's here.

250
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,900
Yes. Come in.

251
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,633
Hello. Thanks for having me.

252
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,033
Come in, Konomi.

253
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,133
How's it going?

254
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,700
Pretty well.

255
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:25,700
Oh, my God. I've only gotten this far.

256
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,733
Hello, Yuki.

257
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,100
Thanks for having me.

258
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,333
What are you doing here?

259
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,233
Nothing.

260
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:47,200
She came to see you of course, Yuki.

261
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,467
So, you came to see me, huh?

262
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,533
Yes.

263
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,467
Why are you acting like my girlfriend
when you're not?

264
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,367
Don't be mean, Yuki.

265
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah. That sounds so mean.

266
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:13,133
Sorry.

267
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:17,967
You're right.

268
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm not even your girlfriend
and I come over all the time.

269
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,233
Who do I think I am?

270
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,867
This isn't right.

271
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,100
Sorry.

272
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,633
I'm going home.

273
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,533
Konomi.

274
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,033
I'm sorry.

275
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,033
-Konomi?
-Konomi.

276
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,767
What's going on? She was crying.

277
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,700
She was?

278
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:47,500
Yes?

279
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,267
Are you busy, Naoki?

280
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:55,100
Hey. What?

281
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:58,700
Well, it's nothing, really.

282
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:06,033
-You're not on duty tonight?
-No.

283
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,967
What are you studying?

284
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,567
Respiratory distress syndrome.

285
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,233
Sounds complicated.

286
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,933
Do doctors really...

287
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:24,167
What do you want?

288
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:29,133
Well... I wanted to...

289
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,500
ask you... Well...

290
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,167
What do you like about Kotoko?

291
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,867
I mean, she's not your type or anything.

292
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,233
So, when did you start liking her?

293
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,433
What's going on?

294
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,733
Is it Konomi?

295
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,733
No.

296
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,833
I never thought this day would come.

297
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:04,900
Well...

298
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:10,867
She kept saying, "I love you"
as if it were a spell.

299
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,600
It was so annoying.

300
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,267
What?

301
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,933
But I started to get used to it.

302
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,467
When she said she was
going to give up on me,

303
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,233
I remember feeling mad.

304
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:29,533
I...

305
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:34,867
I'm going to give up on you.

306
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,567
I should have been relieved.

307
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,300
Kotoko...

308
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,267
can't do 90 percent of what I can do.

309
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,300
But she can do the 10 percent...

310
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,000
that I could never do
in a hundred years.

311
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:03,667
Maybe it became a habit.

312
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,100
I don't know anymore.

313
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,833
How Konomi feels or how I feel.

314
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,767
I tutor her.

315
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,933
She drags me to movies and cafes.

316
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,067
I say it's annoying.

317
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,600
But I wonder if it really is.

318
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,133
When I saw another guy
confess his feelings for her...

319
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:40,367
it pissed me off.

320
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,267
I said some harsh things to her.

321
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:48,133
Sorry.

322
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,433
I realized...

323
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,400
we really are brothers.

324
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
What about?

325
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,667
If you aren't sure, ask Konomi.

326
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,767
That's the simplest answer.

327
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,333
Sorry for bothering you.

328
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,267
Yuki.

329
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,067
I'll tell you the one thing
that Kinnosuke taught me.

330
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,533
According to him...

331
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,067
it's called "jealousy."

332
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:58,700
Let me say this up front.

333
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:02,033
I wasn't waiting for you
because it's Valentine's Day.

334
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,567
It just happened to be
Valentine's Day today.

335
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:05,600
Then...

336
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,967
why were you waiting for me?

337
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,000
Why?

338
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,500
S... Sorry.

339
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,133
Sorry about the other day.

340
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,767
But it was partly your fault, too.

341
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,000
My fault?

342
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,267
You said you didn't have a boyfriend.

343
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,933
To that guy who asked you out.

344
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,633
So I...

345
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:47,967
How did you know?

346
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,100
I happened to be passing by.

347
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,633
You always said that you liked me.

348
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,800
So...

349
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,633
But...

350
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,667
What can I do?

351
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,800
I do like you. A lot.

352
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,400
That hasn't changed
since middle school.

353
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,033
But no matter how much I like you...

354
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,600
As long as you don't like me back...

355
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,067
I can't call you my boyfriend.

356
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,633
I feel like I'm threatening you.

357
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,400
I don't care if it's a one-way love.

358
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:46,567
Although it would be nice
if you felt the same way.

359
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,633
This is perfect.

360
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,300
It's your Valentine's Day present.

361
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,967
How is it?

362
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:24,600
Good. It suits you.

363
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,833
I just...

364
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:40,133
Just...?

365
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:43,833
That wasn't on a whim.

366
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,967
I like you.

367
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,367
I like you, Konomi.

368
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:56,533
So, when other guys ask you out,

369
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,733
tell them you have a boyfriend.

370
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,533
Okay.

371
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:09,300
Okay.

372
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,033
Don't cry.

373
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,333
Tell me again.

374
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:17,467
What?

375
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:19,567
That you like me.

376
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,667
I can't repeat it so many times.

377
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,167
-But it was only twice.
-I said it twice.

378
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,867
It's not easy to say it twice.

379
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:39,733
Thank you.

380
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,233
I'm...

381
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:04,967
Hey.

382
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:08,867
You'll catch a cold sleeping here.

383
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,100
You're home, Naoki.

384
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,800
I guess I fell asleep.

385
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,567
I'm going to take a bath. Go to sleep.

386
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,200
Here. I made you some coffee.

387
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,967
Coffee? Before I go to sleep?

388
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:55,033
Help you with your nursing report?

389
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,467
Please?

390
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,267
Because...

391
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:05,100
I've rewritten it a dozen times,
but they're so critical.

392
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,233
For once, I'd like to turn in a report
that they don't tear apart.

393
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,967
I just need your advice.

394
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:16,467
Just the main points. Please?

395
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,033
Unbelievable.

396
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,100
Sit down.

397
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,933
Really?

398
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,533
Yay!

399
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:40,067
Thank you, Dr. Irie.

400
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,100
Take care.

401
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,467
Take care. Thank you.

402
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,367
You look tired.

403
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:05,833
Nurse Hosoi.

404
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,600
I'm a little sleep deprived.

405
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,033
I see.

406
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,867
That's your last patient
for the afternoon.

407
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,600
Go get some rest.

408
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,000
You have another surgery
this afternoon, right?

409
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,833
Yes. Thank you.

410
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,567
Kotoko is really shaping up lately.

411
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:29,033
I can tell by her report
that she really studied hard.

412
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,033
I see.

413
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,933
Irie!

414
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,233
Irie!

415
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,133
Irie! Where are you?

416
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,767
Come out, you idiot!

417
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:46,867
Hey, Irie.

418
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,167
Do you know Naoki Irie?

419
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
Kin-chan. Chris.

420
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,033
Kotoko.

421
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:57,933
Kotoko, where's Irie?

422
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,300
He's seeing a patient in there, but...

423
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:05,200
What's going on? This is a hospital.

424
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,767
What is it, Kinnosuke?

425
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:10,967
Irie, I need your help. It's Chris.

426
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,300
Calm down. What's wrong?

427
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,067
Naoki.

428
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:17,667
I messed up.

429
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,400
Gauze.

430
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,333
Bandage.

431
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,167
<i>Chris was splattered with hot oil?</i>

432
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,500
Yeah.

433
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:45,100
She burned her leg in the kitchen.

434
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:48,900
I... My mind went blank.

435
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:52,067
I should have gone to the nearest
hospital, but I ended up here.

436
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,167
I always give Irie a hard time,

437
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,700
but when it came down to it,
I could only think of him.

438
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,700
If anything happens to Chris, I...

439
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,900
Don't worry. You did the right thing.

440
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,667
Naoki is a miracle worker.

441
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:10,800
I hope you're right.

442
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:15,800
Chris.

443
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,633
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

444
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,733
A little.

445
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:25,067
Nurse Hosoi, she's my friend.
I'll take her.

446
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,767
Go ahead, then.

447
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:31,500
Her husband can go in
and speak to Dr. Irie.

448
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,933
Her... husband?

449
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,433
So? How is Chris?

450
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll explain in a minute.

451
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,067
Sit down, husband.

452
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,700
Her burns...

453
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:01,800
are pretty bad.
It's penetrated the inner skin.

454
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,000
She'll be in pain for a while.

455
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,600
She should be hospitalized
until she's stable.

456
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,633
-Regarding scarring...
-What?

457
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,567
There may be a little.

458
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,267
She may need cosmetic surgery.

459
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,567
Wait a minute.

460
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,633
There may be scarring?
Chris is an unmarried woman.

461
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,800
If her body is scarred,
what if she can't get married?

462
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,433
But you're marrying her, right?

463
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,567
So, what's the problem?

464
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,333
What are you saying?

465
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:46,033
Are you going to let
another guy have her?

466
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:47,700
Are you kidding?

467
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,433
No way.

468
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,767
I won't let that happen.

469
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,933
I'm not giving her to anyone.

470
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,400
I see.

471
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,867
Got a problem with it?

472
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:12,733
Then why don't you tell Chris?

473
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,833
I know.

474
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
Okay, take it easy, Chris.

475
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:24,700
Ready?

476
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,833
-Okay.
-Okay.

477
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:37,233
Kotoko, you're a real nurse.
I'm impressed.

478
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:39,600
Really?

479
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:45,100
And what about Kin-chan?
He was so desperate.

480
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,933
I've never seen him like that.

481
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:51,700
He was more panicked than I was.
He's so rash sometimes.

482
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:53,767
I guess I can't talk.

483
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,167
He must think you're very special.

484
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:01,867
-Really?
-Yeah.

485
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:04,367
-How is it, Chris?
-See?

486
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,933
-Kinnosuke.
-Does it hurt?

487
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,500
I'm fine.
The painkillers are kicking in.

488
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,633
By the way, what did Irie say?

489
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,167
The pain will only last
a couple of days.

490
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:21,367
What about scarring?

491
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:26,667
Don't worry.
I told Irie to take care of it.

492
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:29,067
I'll beat him up if he leaves a scar.

493
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:32,667
-Kin-chan.
-Don't worry about a thing.

494
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:36,467
Irie and Kotoko are here.
I'll come every day, too.

495
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,267
Okay.

496
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,367
<i>Kin-chan.</i>

497
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:46,700
I gave Mr. Suzuki in Room 205
painkillers at 3:00 p.m.

498
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,400
Please check on his pain level.

499
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,933
Okay.

500
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:57,167
I'll be going, then.

501
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,100
-Good night.
-Good night.

502
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,633
I'm starving.

503
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,300
-See you.
-Good night.

504
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:10,700
Now for the night shift.
It's not good for my skin.

505
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:14,467
-Ms. Irie.
-Nurse Hosoi. I'm going.

506
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:18,667
Good night.
Does Dr. Irie seem tired at home?

507
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,200
Naoki? Why?

508
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:25,600
He's had one major surgery
after another.

509
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,800
I don't think he's getting much sleep.

510
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,533
The action plan is to discuss
pain remedies with the doctor.

511
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:45,067
He had another emergency case
right after his outpatient clinic.

512
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,633
Then he went into surgery
without eating anything.

513
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,800
It's going to be another long one.

514
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,667
I know you're working, too, but...

515
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,667
please take care of
Dr. Irie's health and nutrition.

516
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,800
A doctor's hours are never fixed.

517
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:10,033
It's both physically
and mentally taxing.

518
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,167
You're a doctor's wife, after all.

519
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:17,600
Yes, thank you.

520
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:27,333
<i>She's right.</i>
<i>I haven't done anything lately.</i>

521
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,900
<i>Mom does all the cooking</i>
<i>and cleaning.</i>

522
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,267
<i>I asked him to help me with my report</i>
<i>instead of getting sleep.</i>

523
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:45,400
<i>Naoki, it's been six hours</i>
<i>since the surgery began.</i>

524
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:50,633
Okay.

525
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,567
What is all this, Kotoko?

526
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,200
Naoki has a long surgery tonight.

527
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,633
I thought I'd bring him
a nutritious meal.

528
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,967
Oh, my.

529
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,300
How wonderful.

530
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:15,133
He'll be so happy.

531
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,567
I hope so.

532
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:23,167
<i>Just wait, Naoki.</i>

533
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:26,033
<i>I made you lots of good food.</i>

534
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,733
Naoki.

535
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,400
You just finished your surgery.

536
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:39,500
I wanted to bring you
something nutritious

537
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,100
that will give you stamina...

538
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,067
Naoki.

539
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,300
Naoki?

540
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:04,700
Naoki?

541
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:08,400
Naoki.

542
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,133
Naoki.

543
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,833
Naoki!

544
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:16,533
No!

545
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,367
Naoki! Naoki!

546
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,433
Naoki!

547
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:26,167
Naoki, get up!

548
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:56,200
It's my fault.

549
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:57,100
<i>Next Episode</i>
<i>Ep.15 "Tearful Proposal"</i>

550
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,233
<i>My goodness, Naoki.</i>
<i>You're so lame.</i>

551
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,000
What happened to your
triple flip landing?

552
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:03,667
<i>I'll be your private nurse.</i>

553

<i>Don't try to find the spot</i>

00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,433
I decided to do it in front of my family.

558
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,833
I knew she'd say yes.

559
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,633
-Did that help?
-Hell no.

560
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:24,233
{\an8}Will you break up with Naoki
and marry Kinnosuke?

561
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,367
