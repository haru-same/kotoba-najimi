1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,733
Naoki!

2
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,367
Blow out the candles, Kotoko.

3
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:36,500
Okay.

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,133
Hmm?

5
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,067
What?

6
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,000
That's not right.

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,933
Good morning.

8
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:14,767
Oh, morning.

9
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,500
Doing facial exercises in your sleep?

10
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:19,800
What?

11
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:23,867
First you were smiling.
Then you puckered up like a fish.

12
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,800
You were blowing, too.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,133
A fish?

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,700
Oh...

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,033
It was a dream!

16
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,067
Sigh...

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Why the exaggerated sigh?

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,133
I know you are all aware

19
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:57,267
that the 28th of this month
is my birthday.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,167
We had no clue.

21
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:04,100
Neither does Naoki. Probably.

22
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,200
What?! Why not?

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,633
He's your husband!

24
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,933
He has 200 on IQ test,
but not when it comes to birthdays...

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,267
Not even in one corner
of his brilliant mind?

26
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,867
No room for trivia?

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,300
His mom throws me a party every year

28
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,667
and he's forced to attend.

29
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:40,100
But I want him to
want to celebrate my birthday!

30
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,833
But he has no interest...

31
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,100
That's not love.

32
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,500
I wouldn't stand for it.

33
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,567
I'd be fine with
a super expensive present.

34
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,533
You're so materialistic.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,867
Why don't you ask for a present?

36
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:01,100
A super expensive one!

37
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:05,933
It's not the price!
A gift should be heartfelt.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,567
What has he given you so far?

39
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:11,433
What has he given me? Well...

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,900
Tell us! Tell us!

41
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:15,867
Tell us what he gave you!

42
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,567
Hmm? Huh?

43
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,400
<i>Wait a minute, he's never...</i>

44
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:29,967
He's never given me a present.

45
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,233
No way!

46
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,167
How many years
have you been married?

47
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,333
I can't believe it.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,367
Poor Kotoko.

49
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,633
This calls for a divorce!

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,733
He doesn't love you at all!

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,267
That's not true! He's just a little shy.

52
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,567
I know he loves me.

53
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:51,900
Here is a problem.

54
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,067
Is there another woman?

55
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,500
Fine!

56
00:03:55,567 --> 00:04:00,933
This year, it will be roses,
and champagne,

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,633
and a heartfelt present.
I will make it come true!

58
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,200
1000 yen that it doesn't.

59
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:08,933
Me, too. 1000 yen.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,367
Count me in. 1000 yen.

61
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,500
Doesn't anyone have faith?

62
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,933
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

63
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,133
{\an8}FINAL EPISODE

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,367
{\an8}BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER

65
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,867
The 28th?

66
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:17,967
Yes!

67
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,767
I have surgery and night duty.

68
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,767
Was there something else?

69
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,800
<i>He doesn't remember...</i>

70
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,933
Never mind.

71
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:41,700
<i>I won't give up! This calls for...</i>

72
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,233
There you are, Mr. Irie!

73
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,133
What's with you?

74
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,100
Oh, it's you, Funatsu.

75
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:57,033
I'll take your shift on the 28th.

76
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,200
Huh?

77
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,967
On the 28th.

78
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,867
I don't need to switch shifts.

79
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:05,900
Huh?

80
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,767
-But you have to!
-Huh?

81
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,567
You have to switch with me!

82
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,200
Or else Kotoko-- Oops.

83
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,067
Why do I have to?

84
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,667
No...

85
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,067
What did Kotoko tell you?

86
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,433
No, nothing.

87
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,867
Funatsu!

88
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,400
Kotoko said if I switch shifts
with you on the 28th

89
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:35,900
she'll arrange a date for me
with Miss Marina.

90
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,867
A date?

91
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,600
So, please let me
take your shift on the 28th!

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,633
That's a promise!

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,367
What's with Funatsu?

94
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,667
Just you and Naoki?

95
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,500
I'm sorry...

96
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,967
I'm so sad!

97
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,967
I was looking forward to this event!

98
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,000
The banner is almost finished.

99
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,267
Banner?

100
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,367
See?

101
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,567
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,633
We can have a party.

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,800
No!

104
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,233
You're absolutely right!

105
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,100
Naoki hates our parties.

106
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,900
He acts like he's forced to be there!

107
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,967
I've never seen him give you a present.

108
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,233
All right, Kotoko!

109
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,500
You and Naoki should spend some
quality time together this year.

110
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:44,133
I'll swallow my tears this time.

111
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,300
Mom...

112
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:52,300
Let's put up a plan for this, Kotoko!

113
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,400
Okay!

114
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,667
How can we drop subtle hints,

115
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:00,567
so, Naoki will remember your birthday?

116
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:01,700
Yes...

117
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,200
Subtle hints won't work.

118
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,200
What?

119
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,133
You were scheming with Funatsu today.

120
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,400
Funatsu... That big mouth!

121
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,033
So, your birthday is coming up.

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,400
Mom gets excited every year.

123
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,567
{\an8}But I have no interest in birthdays.

124
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,500
{\an8}Naoki, you're terrible!

125
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:34,800
{\an8}You have no interest in
your beloved wife's birthday?

126
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:40,233
Do you want to celebrate
your birthday that badly?

127
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,800
{\an8}It was my lifelong dream.

128
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,933
{\an8}I see...

129
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,633
What kind of birthday
is your lifelong dream?

130
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,667
Tell him, Kotoko!

131
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,700
It's embarrassing.

132
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,267
I just...

133
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,633
I would get all dressed up.

134
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:12,533
<i>Naoki would give me</i>
<i>a huge bouquet of roses.</i>

135
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,867
<i>We'd have dinner.</i>

136
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,467
<i>The chef would bring us a cake.</i>

137
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:33,900
<i>Everyone would sing</i>
<i>"Happy Birthday" to me.</i>

138
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,267
<i>We would sip champagne.</i>

139
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,167
<i>And spend the evening together.</i>

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,267
I see how important this is to you.

141
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:06,667
Huh?

142
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,433
I'll switch shifts with Funatsu
on the 28th.

143
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,500
Really?

144
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,633
Are you sure?

145
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,733
Yeah. He can be a pest, too.

146
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,267
Yay!

147
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,767
You did it, Kotoko!

148
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Yay! Naoki!

149
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,467
<i>From the day I met Naoki</i>

150
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,833
<i>I dreamed of a birthday like this.</i>

151
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:55,967
<i>My birthday finally came.</i>

152
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,433
SEPTEMBER 28
KOTOKO'S BIRTHDAY

153
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,867
Don't forget, Naoki!

154
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,767
7:00 p.m. at the Royal Hotel lobby!

155
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,867
Yeah.

156
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,667
Remember, Naoki.

157
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:12,733
I gave up my party plan for Kotoko!

158
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah.

159
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:19,800
I don't need a bouquet of roses.
It's okay.

160
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,133
Yeah!

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,567
I really don't! Not at all.

162
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,400
Give me a break! Enough already!

163
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,567
Poor Naoki.

164
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,467
A little...

165
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,167
See you.

166
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,233
{\an8}<i>I see my lover going down the stairs</i>

167
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,033
{\an8}<i>I just want to pull his sleeve</i>

168
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,500
{\an8}<i>And turn him around</i>

169
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:06,300
{\an8}<i>Hug me and hug my heart</i>

170
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:13,333
{\an8}<i>Take all of me, please!</i>

171
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,567
{\an8}<i>I want you to focus on me</i>

172
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:28,233
{\an8}<i>If you are focused on</i>

173
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,200
{\an8}<i>Some other girl</i>

174
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,400
{\an8}<i>I will go crazy</i>

175
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,867
{\an8}"Hair Salon at 3:30 p.m."
I'd better get ready, too.

176
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,533
{\an8}<i>The world looks brighter</i>

177
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,533
{\an8}<i>Because of you</i>

178
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,300
{\an8}<i>The feeling of love</i>

179
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,067
{\an8}<i>Put on my beautiful dress</i>

180
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,333
{\an8}<i>and get my hair done</i>

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,667
{\an8}<i>into a beautiful hair style.</i>

182
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,800
{\an8}<i>And my make-up, too.</i>

183
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,633
{\an8}<i>This is a special day.</i>

184
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,800
<i>I'm going all-out!</i>

185
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,600
He may fall in love with me
all over again!

186
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:15,033
{\an8}<i>I cut my hair just a little</i>

187
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,967
{\an8}<i>Do you not like it?</i>

188
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:29,433
Mom, her hair looks like a cockatoo.

189
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,600
Shh!

190
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,533
<i>This is terrible!</i>

191
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,967
<i>What is this hair style?</i>

192
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:45,133
<i>Maybe I should do it over!</i>
<i>But I don't have time.</i>

193
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,700
<i>Maybe it's not as bad as I think...</i>

194
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,100
<i>Why couldn't I tell him</i>
<i>I didn't like it?</i>

195
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

196
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,133
What's wrong?

197
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,233
Are you okay?

198
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,367
What's wrong?

199
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:16,733
She started wavering
and she doubled over.

200
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,467
She collapsed and hit her head!

201
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,333
Are you okay?

202
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,700
Let's put your head up a little, okay?

203
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,200
Okay.

204
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,967
Does anyone have a handkerchief?

205
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,167
Here, use this.

206
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,233
Thank you.

207
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,833
Can you call an ambulance?

208
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,200
Sure!

209
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,300
Okay.

210
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:49,767
Can I borrow your bag?

211
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,767
-Sure.
-Place it under her head.

212
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,033
Is she a nurse?

213
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,367
I thought she was a barmaid.

214
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,933
The ambulance will be here soon.

215
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
Can you say your name?

216
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,033
Does it hurt anywhere else?

217
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,833
She's lucky you were a nurse.

218
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,300
I think it's anemia,
but she was also bleeding...

219
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,100
Thank you very much.

220
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,000
You did a great job.

221
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,100
Good job, lady.

222
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,533
Terrific.

223
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,633
Very cool.

224
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,600
Not really...

225
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,000
Her bag...

226
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,967
Just leave it there.

227
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,600
You can come with us.

228
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,900
I was just passing by.

229
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,533
She's not my friend...

230
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,133
Let me out!

231
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:58,967
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>I'm over two hours late.</i>

232
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:02,467
<i>Naoki may have already left.</i>

233
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,067
Why today?

234
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,700
<i>Sorry, Naoki!</i>

235
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,700
<i>Please wait...</i>

236
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,667
<i>...a little longer!</i>

237
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:35,800
Ma'am.

238
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:39,967
What happened to your dress?

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
What do you mean?

240
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,100
Are you hurt?

241
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,400
This is... Oh, no!

242
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,000
What should I do?

243
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:53,233
Ma'am?

244
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
I can't see Naoki like this.

245
00:17:56,733 --> 00:18:00,067
I was supposed
to meet someone here.

246
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,933
But I'm already 3 hours late.

247
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,367
Shall I call him?

248
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,500
It's my birthday.

249
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,833
I can't see Naoki like this.

250
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,267
Ma'am...

251
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,167
It's my first birthday with him.

252
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,833
I can't see him like this!

253
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,233
Why not wait over there?

254
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,533
Did he go home already?

255
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:35,933
I have no idea, ma'am.

256
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,133
Naoki?

257
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,667
I thought you were hurt.

258
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,733
You scared me.

259
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,567
Naoki!

260
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,233
I'm sorry I'm so late.

261
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,600
A lot happened
and I couldn't get here...

262
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,433
I was going crazy.

263
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:23,367
I thought you'd already left.

264
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:26,833
But I couldn't give up.

265
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,667
I knew you'd get here today,

266
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
even if you had to crawl all the way.

267
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,300
How could I leave?

268
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,967
But you look a mess.

269
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,667
I know...

270
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,100
You can tell me about it later.

271
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:54,967
I'm hungry.

272
00:19:57,867 --> 00:20:00,200
The restaurant is closed.

273
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,433
And the way you look...

274
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,767
Hey, guy!

275
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:08,967
Hi!

276
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,667
You dropped your package.

277
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:18,000
Someone will steal it
if you leave it there.

278
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,533
Here you go. Hold it.

279
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,700
Oh, no!

280
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:27,467
I have to catch a plane
back to my home country.

281
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,667
Good luck, you two!

282
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,600
See you!

283
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,433
How pretty.

284
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:56,067
A rose for every year.

285
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,400
And there's cake. Let's eat it.

286
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:07,000
What was my mom thinking?

287
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,100
What am I going to do with this?

288
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,633
Mom...

289
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,867
I wonder if she was
secretly waiting for me?

290
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,533
{\an8}Probably. With her video camera.

291
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,700
She has so much time on her hands.

292
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,967
But I'm so happy.

293
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:35,333
I'm the luckiest wife in the world.

294
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,033
Happy birthday, Kotoko.

295
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,233
Naoki...

296
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,667
What do you want for a present?

297
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,400
Rea-- Really?

298
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,400
What should I ask for?

299
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,700
Um... Well...

300
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:55,933
I get it!

301
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,000
I want to hear you say, "I love you."

302
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,167
"I love you."

303
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,133
I take it back! Let me think again!

304
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,633
Um... Well... Let me see...

305
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,167
I love you, Kotoko.

306
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,933
Me, too...

307
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,300
I love you...

308
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,800
<i>It's been a while since I met Naoki,</i>

309
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,300
<i>but my heart still pounds.</i>

310
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,533
<i>Why do I...?</i>

311
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>Why do I love him so much?</i>

312
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,900
Oh...

313
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,233
I forgot.

314
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,033
<i>Does Naoki</i>

315
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:43,167
<i>love me just as much as I do?</i>

316
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,233
<i>He makes my heart pound every day.</i>

317
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,000
<i>Do I...</i>

318
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:56,033
<i>...make his heart pound sometimes?</i>

319
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,667
<i>I hope I do.</i>

320
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,200
What's with the creepy smile?

321
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:21,833
I never get tired of looking at it!

322
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,500
That was over 2 months ago!

323
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,933
I know.

324
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,267
But I could stare at it forever.

325
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:33,300
I guess it was worth it.

326
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,633
It brings you so much joy.

327
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,667
You have letters, Kotoko.

328
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,300
Thank you.

329
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,500
It's from Chris.

330
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:57,367
Oh, my God! Look at this!

331
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,467
How lovely!

332
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,533
What is it?

333
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,267
Look!

334
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:10,167
<i>Dear Naoki and Kotoko...</i>

335
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:15,433
<i>We held our wedding</i>
<i>at a castle resort.</i>

336
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,200
<i>We've been on honeymoon</i>
<i>in England for a while.</i>

337
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:25,700
<i>We'll be a couple</i>
<i>to rival the two of you!</i>

338
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,900
<i>I'm so happy right now.</i>
<i>Chris.</i>

339
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:37,000
Chris must come from a rich family.

340
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,733
I guess...

341
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,233
It's beautiful.

342
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,967
Kinnosuke looks pretty good, too.

343
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,533
They both look so happy.

344
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,200
Yuki?

345
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:59,600
I feel kind of feverish.

346
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,800
What?

347
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,200
He does.

348
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,900
Maybe I got it from Konomi.
She's not well, either.

349
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,333
Why would you catch her cold?

350
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,967
What are you saying?

351
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,700
All right. Wait a minute.

352
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,000
Here.

353
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:35,133
<i>We were still okay at this time.</i>

354
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:40,467
NEXT MORNING

355
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:54,433
Now everyone's...

356
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,233
Breathe in.

357
00:28:58,133 --> 00:28:59,167
Breathe out.

358
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:03,767
Open your mouth.

359
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,067
Your throat is all red.

360
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,933
Dad, you're next.

361
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,267
Thanks.

362
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:26,833
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>the hospital was in a state of chaos.</i>

363
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,367
<i>Even more than yesterday,</i>

364
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,333
<i>we were inundated</i>
<i>with influenza patients.</i>

365
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,433
So many people...

366
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:48,967
Excuse me.

367
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,300
Are you from the Surgical Unit?

368
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,167
Yes! I'm Kotoko Irie!

369
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,733
I'm here to support you.

370
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:58,033
Naoki!

371
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,867
Kotoko.

372
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,000
What are you doing here?

373
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,133
The same thing as you.

374
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,000
What a coincidence!

375
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:12,067
I guess they see us
as the dynamic duo.

376
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,133
"Us?"

377
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,133
You're the equivalent of 100 doctors!
We can do it!

378
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:17,700
I guess.

379
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,400
<i>I get to work with Naoki.</i>

380
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:30,267
<i>I'm so lucky!</i>

381
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,233
Ms. Irie?

382
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,167
Stop daydreaming. Come here.

383
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,367
Oh, yes.

384
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>The days that followed</i>
<i>were like a nightmare.</i>

385
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,067
Makiko Yamada.
Please wait outside Room 2.

386
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,167
Yes.

387
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,067
Are you Mrs. Yamada?

388
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,733
Please wait over here.

389
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,467
I'm prescribing an inhalant.

390
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,700
Please start using it immediately.

391
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,300
Thank you.

392
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
Take care.

393
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:21,967
Yum!

394
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,267
Coming!

395
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,133
Hello? Irie residence.

396
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,500
Oh, Kotoko.

397
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,767
You still can't come home?

398
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:46,133
Oh, my! How are you holding up?

399
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,933
For both us and your patients,
you've hardly gotten any sleep.

400
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:56,633
We're fine over here.

401
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,167
My fever is almost gone,
thanks to you.

402
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,833
Yes.

403
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:08,267
Don't work too hard.

404
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,567
Okay.

405
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,267
All right.

406
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,233
I hope she's okay.

407
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,767
So, you can't go home, too?

408
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,633
Naoki!

409
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,067
You're still here, too?

410
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,267
There's too much going on.

411
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm so happy!

412
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:41,300
Our shifts rarely overlap.

413
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,500
How can you be happy?

414
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:50,367
I've always dreamed about this.

415
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,700
What?

416
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,833
I've been wanting to ask you...

417
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,767
Are you feeling okay?

418
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,867
What? Uh...

419
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,067
I'm a little tired.

420
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:12,400
Maybe a little feverish. But I'm fine.

421
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:13,867
Are you eating?

422
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:18,833
I don't have much of an appetite.
We've been so busy.

423
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,700
But I'm fine.

424
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,300
I see.

425
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Naoki!
Were you super worried about me?

426
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:33,600
Were you worried your
beloved wife had influenza?

427
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,700
No--

428
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:37,600
Oh, Naoki!

429
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,267
I'm so happy.

430
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,867
I see you're fine.

431
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:53,133
There you are, Dr. Irie, Kotoko.

432
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,167
-What's wrong?
-An emergency.

433
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,233
It hurts!

434
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,967
You'll be fine!

435
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:04,433
Doctor! My son is...

436
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,600
What's wrong?

437
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,467
His bike ran through a glass door.

438
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,600
The bleeding doesn't stop.

439
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,100
I've been applying pressure.

440
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,000
You should have called an ambulance.

441
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,000
But if I let go...

442
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:18,067
...of the blood.
I couldn't even make a phone call.

443
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:19,733
Come sit over here.

444
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,533
Let go. Let me see the wound.

445
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,967
I need light.

446
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,500
Let me have the towel, Mom.

447
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,433
It'll be fine.

448
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,167
It's fine.

449
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:36,300
We have to remove the glass.

450
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,833
This may hurt a bit,
but hang in there.

451
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,400
-Ow... It hurts...
-Takashi!

452
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:46,933
I'm sorry, Takashi!
I wish I could help you.

453
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,100
Calm down, Mom!

454
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:52,267
Your son will get scared
if you're not calm!

455
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,700
Let's encourage him together!

456
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:55,867
Nurse...

457
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:58,800
Don't worry.
When it comes to removing glass,

458
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:01,100
Dr. Irie is Number 1!

459
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,133
-Right?
-Yes.

460
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,100
Takashi...

461
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,167
Be brave, Takashi!

462
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:14,100
You can do it, Takashi.

463
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:17,800
Ow... It hurts!

464
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,200
Come on, Takashi!

465
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,800
Just a little more, Takashi.

466
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,633
I'm sorry.

467
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:29,167
I panicked. I'm so embarrassed.

468
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,900
That's natural.
It must've been shocking.

469
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:37,300
When you told me
I had to calm down for him,

470
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,400
it really woke me up.

471
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,800
I realized I had to be strong for him.

472
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,733
Well...

473
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm glad the cuts weren't
as deep as we thought.

474
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,533
You did great, Takashi. Good job!

475
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,467
Thank you so much.

476
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,233
I'm so glad we had the Number 1
glass-removing doctor in Japan

477
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,333
and a very nice nurse
to take care of us.

478
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:07,900
Excuse us.

479
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,767
Take care.

480
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,500
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

481
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,600
Let's go.

482
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:17,467
Ow.

483
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:19,467
You must be happy.

484
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,667
Someone finally recognized
your value as a nurse.

485
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,233
What? That's not true.

486
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,533
The Number 1 glass-removing
doctor in Japan, huh?

487
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,600
What an honor.

488
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,633
But...

489
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,467
I'm happy, Naoki.

490
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,300
Mothers are amazing.

491
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,900
She carried Takashi all the way here.

492
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:53,233
She's so tiny herself.

493
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:55,633
Yeah.

494
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,867
They're amazing.

495
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:01,267
The protective instinct
of a mother is so powerful!

496
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,200
It sure is.

497
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:06,967
Dr. Irie!

498
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,167
I'm sorry. We have another patient.

499
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,033
What a crazy night.

500
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,867
Kotoko, go home.
Another nurse is coming.

501
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:18,967
Huh?

502
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:22,100
Miss Yamamura is coming soon.

503
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,967
No, I can still work.

504
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:28,300
Naoki is still working. So, can I...

505
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:32,900
<i>What...?</i>

506
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,600
<i>This is weird... I can't stand...</i>

507
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:43,367
-Kotoko!
-Kotoko?

508
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,467
Kotoko!

509
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,000
<i>Naoki...</i>

510
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:57,933
She's awake!

511
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:02,000
It's true! Kotoko is awake!

512
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,200
Naoki! Kotoko is up!

513
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,267
-Kotoko...
-Mom, calm down.

514
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,700
What...? I...

515
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,267
Kotoko, you collapsed at the hospital.

516
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,867
Naoki carried you home.

517
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,667
You've been sleeping until now.

518
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:28,733
We were so worried!
Thank God you're up.

519
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,467
I'm sorry I made you worry.

520
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:33,567
That's right.

521
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,500
You really had us worried...

522
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,833
All is well! Kotoko's fine.

523
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,333
I'm sorry, Kotoko!

524
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:48,733
You caught our influenza!

525
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,800
You had to work at the hospital

526
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,833
and take care of us as well.

527
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:02,467
We pushed you too hard.

528
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:05,833
This is not it, Mom.

529
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,167
I slept well, so, I feel totally fine.

530
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:13,067
If I take some medicine now,
I'll be totally okay tomorrow.

531
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,900
Really, Kotoko?

532
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,800
Yes! I'm fine!

533
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,033
I'll bring you some water, then.

534
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,800
Thank you.

535
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,100
Naoki! Look, Kotoko is up.

536
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,500
-Don't drink it.
-What?

537
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:39,867
Not now.

538
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,333
Sorry to worry you, Naoki,

539
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,667
but I'm totally fine now.

540
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:50,400
I don't know why
I totally blacked out--

541
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,600
Kotoko.

542
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:53,867
When...

543
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,633
...was your last period?

544
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,500
W-- W-- What...?

545
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,967
Why...do...you ask?

546
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:08,000
What are you saying?

547
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,033
Are you...?

548
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:12,800
Naoki?

549
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:15,600
...pregnant?

550
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,100
Ready?

551
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,200
Jump!

552
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,433
Naoki.

553
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,100
Nothing.

554
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,233
