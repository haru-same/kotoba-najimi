1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,700
Your basic training starts on Monday.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,500
I have some handouts
from Tonan University Hospital.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,400
I'll distribute them now. Here.

4
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,500
I hope there are some
good looking male patients.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
What if I fall in love
with one of them?

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,700
Hurry!

7
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:27,833
<i>At last! I wonder what kind</i>
<i>of patients we'll get!</i>

8
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,900
I want Nurse Kotoko!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,633
Leave it to me!

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,900
Naotaro, you have to cooperate.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,100
But I... I...

12
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:43,633
Sounds good.

13
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,933
My...

14
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,900
You're like a granddaughter to me.

15
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,733
Oh, Grandma Naoko.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,567
But it can't all be so good.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,167
I don't want your pity!

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,133
I know I can't walk anymore.

19
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:16,367
Stupid!

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,533
Weakling! I know you can do it!

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,100
Nurse Kotoko...

22
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,467
We'll work hard...together.

23
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,600
Kotoko is in dreamland again.

24
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:41,300
Hey, Irie! Come back!

25
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,533
I'm sorry...

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,700
No daydreaming during training.

27
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,067
Yes.

28
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,767
The printouts I gave you
outline the case histories

29
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:57,867
of patients in the orthopedic department
to which you are assigned.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,667
Read them over carefully

31
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,567
so you can manage them properly.

32
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,600
Yes!

33
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,933
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

34
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:11,367
{\an8}RIVALRY WITH GRANDMA TOYO

35
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,733
Good morning. I'm Head Nurse Hosoi.

36
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,433
Good morning.

37
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,200
Over the next two weeks,
these trainees will be training

38
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,600
in the orthopedic wing.

39
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,933
If you have any questions

40
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,733
ask these veteran nurses.

41
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes...

42
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:38,033
<i>Gosh! I'm so nervous.</i>

43
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,067
We're going to make our rounds.

44
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,467
I'll introduce you to the patients.

45
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:46,733
Akiko.

46
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:51,067
Nurse Saeki. I'm going to rehab.

47
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,267
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,333
This is Kamogari.
He's training with us for two weeks.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,067
I'm Keita Kamogari. Nice to meet you.

50
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,667
Nice to meet you.

51
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,200
This is a good opportunity.

52
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,833
May I take her to the rehab center?

53
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,533
Oh... well, please do.

54
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you.

55
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,133
Shall we go, Akiko?

56
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,967
Yes.

57
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,700
Are you cold?

58
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,167
I'm fine.

59
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:37,533
Shion, this is a trainee, Motoki Kikyo.

60
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:49,000
He's going to be with us for two weeks.

61
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,167
A guy?

62
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:55,633
He doesn't look like it. Whatever.

63
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Shion? Where is Shion?

64
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,133
Mr. Aoki.

65
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,933
You're perfect.

66
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,267
You'll get used to it.

67
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,800
She'll make a great figurine.

68
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,667
I fell off my bike.

69
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,433
My face got all bloody.

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,633
Nurse Yamamoto,
may I change his bandages?

71
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:37,033
Oh... you want to try?

72
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,533
May I see

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,100
your open wounds?

74
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:53,333
Good morning, Mrs. Yoshida.
I brought a new trainee.

75
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,467
This is Ms. Irie.
She'll be helping us for two weeks.

76
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:02,800
My name is Kotoko Irie.
I'm pleased to meet you.

77
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,800
I can't be remembering
trainee's names.

78
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:16,133
I bet you can't even change a bed.

79
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,967
<i>Not what I expected!</i>

80
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,100
God!

81
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:31,667
That sassy little brat.
With a name like Shion?

82
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,900
All he does is eat snacks,
the little piggy.

83
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,033
Anime freaks are just as bad.

84
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:41,167
They talk about anime
for one hour straight.

85
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,367
You could teach a class
on anime in two weeks.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,867
My patient is nice.

87
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,300
Mine, too.

88
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,667
What's wrong, Kotoko?
You look faint.

89
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,300
So...

90
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,600
...there's a patient, Mrs. Yoshida.

91
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,867
She's incredible.

92
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,567
She called me eight times
this morning alone!

93
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,200
Eight times?!

94
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,767
I massaged her shoulders,
back, arms, legs.

95
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,267
I made her a cup of tea.
And another. And another.

96
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:28,233
Then massaged her shoulders and back...

97
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,933
Ms. Irie. Good job this morning.

98
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,467
Thank you.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,333
Mrs. Yoshida is at it again.

100
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,433
Oh... bullying the trainees.

101
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,767
Sorry you had to take all her calls.

102
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:48,567
She'd just yell at me if I went.

103
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:54,533
Watch out. The previous trainee
lost confidence and quit.

104
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,233
What? She quit?

105
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm starved. What are you eating?

106
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,833
What are you eating, Irie?

107
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:05,867
Naoki...

108
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,500
It's Mr. Irie! He's so cool!

109
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,733
I examined a patient
with him the other day.

110
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,167
Oh my god, really?

111
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:18,500
See that guy?
He's an intern named Naoki Irie.

112
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,067
Isn't he handsome?

113
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:24,300
That's right. He's our idol.

114
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,400
He's still a student, but he's so smart.

115
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,967
He's more capable than
most of the doctors here.

116
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,167
Oh... you trainees.

117
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,400
Don't even try to get his attention.

118
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,500
Should you try to go over our heads,

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,733
you know what will happen.

120
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,700
Hey!

121
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,967
How did your training go?

122
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,033
Have you met Mrs. Yoshida yet?

123
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,233
Yeah.

124
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,500
I think you'll make a great pair.

125
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,967
No...

126
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,400
Well, good luck.

127
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,033
Wait a minute...

128
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,333
Hey! What was that?

129
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,867
Why was Mr. Irie talking to you?

130
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,433
Before me, even!

131
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,567
You just got here.
What are you to him?

132
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,533
Well...

133
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,600
Spit it out!

134
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,233
Explain yourself!

135
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,600
I...

136
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,300
Kotoko is Mr. lrie's wife.

137
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,767
What?!

138
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,633
I can empathize.
We felt the same way.

139
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:45,067
Are you kidding?
I heard he was married,

140
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,133
but to that plain Jane?

141
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,667
I don't get it.

142
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,933
I can't help it.

143
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,433
That's just fine.

144
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,333
I'm sure Mr. Irie's wife
is an exceptional nurse.

145
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:05,533
She won't need any guidance from us.

146
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:10,500
Should we leave Mrs. Yoshida
in Mrs. Irie's care?

147
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,867
That is...

148
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,900
- Great idea.
- Yes!

149
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,400
Let's eat! Let's eat!

150
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,000
Excuse me, nurses...

151
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,600
Kotoko... good luck!

152
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:34,333
Excuse me... excuse me!

153
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,100
Excuse me...

154
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,367
Thirty-five, 36...

155
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,033
You rang, Mrs. Yoshida?

156
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,467
You're late.
You should be here in 15 seconds!

157
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,567
But this is the 12th call!
What's wrong now?

158
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,300
Turn on the TV.

159
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,933
Your remote is right here.

160
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:03,233
My hand hurts.

161
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,967
I can't press the button.

162
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:10,167
It's a button. Just press it.

163
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,300
And you have two hands!
Use your other hand!

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,833
What?

165
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,633
You!

166
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:22,433
How can you be so cruel
to a bed-ridden, old lady?

167
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:26,833
You're full of energy!
You're just spoiled!

168
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,033
You're a terrible girl...

169
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,600
A demon... demon...

170
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,767
What is it? What happened?

171
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,267
Nurse Hosoi...

172
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,067
What is it, Mrs. Yoshida?

173
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,867
This trainee is terrible.

174
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:54,833
She yelled at this poor, old lady.

175
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,767
Ms. Irie! Come with me!

176
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,100
You'll be all right.

177
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,233
Five floors...

178
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:23,767
Why can't trainees use the elevator?

179
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,167
Two more floors to go...

180
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,667
Okay!

181
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,767
Here you go.

182
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,967
Not this one!

183
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,800
I said the one
with chocolate crunchies!

184
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,933
Where are my crunchies?

185
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,267
They don't sell crunchies. Who cares?

186
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,233
Chocolate is chocolate!

187
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,133
Are you stupid?

188
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,467
Chocolate without crunchies
isn't chocolate!

189
00:13:57,067 --> 00:14:00,467
Get out of here! Buy me another one!

190
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,200
Now I made a mistake.

191
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,600
Please take care.

192
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm back...

193
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,067
Good job, Ms. Irie.

194
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:16,767
Let me sit down...

195
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:23,500
There it is! Mrs. Yoshida's
22nd call of the day.

196
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,400
What?

197
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,067
Hurry up!

198
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,367
Yes...

199
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:31,867
What's wrong?

200
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,300
What now, Mrs. Yoshida?

201
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,833
Come over here. Hold this!

202
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,967
-Hold it up.
-Okay.

203
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,133
Today is a very important day.

204
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,933
Mrs. Yoshida, the doctor is here.

205
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,767
Oh, no!

206
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,467
Okay! Go!

207
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,933
Ready!

208
00:14:59,033 --> 00:14:59,900
This...

209
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,467
-Leave it there!
-Yes.

210
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,700
<i>Naoki...</i>

211
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:16,033
<i>I endure all these hardships</i>

212
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,233
<i>for moments like this...</i>

213
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,133
Grandma Yoshida. How are you?

214
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,900
Are you feeling a little better?

215
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,700
Actually, I'm aching all over.

216
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,633
And this trainee is totally useless.

217
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,600
Go easy on her, okay?

218
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,067
May I check you?

219
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,333
Oh, but...

220
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,100
I prefer Dr. Irie.

221
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,167
Mrs. Yoshida!

222
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,967
But I've been waiting all day

223
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,167
for Dr. Irie to come.

224
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,400
Mrs. Yoshida...

225
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,567
I told you a hundred times.
Interns can't...

226
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,633
No! Not you!

227
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:09,700
I would never let you touch
this precious body.

228
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,333
Dr. Irie, please.

229
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,700
<i>Does she...</i>

230
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:21,833
I'll make a special exception.

231
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,467
Go ahead, Irie.

232
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:25,833
Yes.

233
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,400
<i>She has a thing for Naoki?</i>

234
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,833
Let me take your pulse.

235
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:34,933
Sure.

236
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,100
Doctor...

237
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Is my pulse fast?

238
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,367
Yes. Maybe just a little.

239
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,833
It's because I'm thinking of you.

240
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,267
Then it must be temporary.

241
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>What is this conversation?</i>

242
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,933
Mrs. Yoshida really likes Mr. Irie.

243
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,800
She's fine.

244
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,867
Good.

245
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,933
Mrs. Yoshida,

246
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:10,400
you know Mr. Irie is married
to this trainee.

247
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,467
Wha...?

248
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:19,967
You must be joking.

249
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,200
Don't kid an old lady.

250
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:27,500
How could Dr. Irie be married
to this foolish trainee?

251
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,633
Right?

252
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:29,933
It's true.

253
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:38,633
<i>Now the bullying will never stop.</i>

254
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,767
Was your name Kotoko?

255
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,100
Yes...

256
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:59,633
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

257
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,533
Yes.

258
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,400
If Dr. Irie chose you,
you must be a good girl.

259
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,733
From now on,

260
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,967
I'll entrust my care to you!

261
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,933
Grandma... Yoshida!

262
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,200
Okay. Take care, Mrs. Yoshida.

263
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,000
Let me check your pulse next time.

264
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,233
Okay.

265
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:36,900
Kotoko.

266
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes?

267
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,567
As a gesture of peace,
let's share a snack together.

268
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,967
Really, Grandma?

269
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,767
Just a moment. I'll make some tea.

270
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,133
Oh, no. Allow me...

271
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,900
Never mind! Sit down.

272
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,367
This is super delicious.

273
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,500
Go ahead! I'll be right back.

274
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,833
Grandma...

275
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,400
Looks good!

276
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,733
<i>This is it...</i>

277
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>The reason I became a nurse.</i>

278
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>I'll never forget</i>

279
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,667
<i>this day!</i>

280
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,933
Ms. Irie!

281
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,300
Nurse Hosoi! Look at this.

282
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,633
What in the world are you doing?

283
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,033
You take sweets away from a patient
and make her serve you tea!

284
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,633
-No, it's not...
-Don't lie!

285
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,900
Mrs. Yoshida just came crying to me.

286
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,000
She said you were bullying her!

287
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:02,133
Nurses should not receive gifts
from patients.

288
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,433
But look at you!

289
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,333
I've seen all kinds of trainees
in my time

290
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,867
but never someone like you!

291
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,367
Ms. Irie! Are you listening?

292
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:28,700
You did a great job in rehab today.

293
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Thanks to you, Keita.

294
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,733
At this rate,

295
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,367
you'll be walking in no time.

296
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,600
Keep it up!

297
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,367
I'll do my best!

298
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,333
<i>This isn't how it's supposed to be.</i>

299
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,700
Grandma Toyo, what's this?

300
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,167
More to the right.

301
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,767
Go.

302
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,367
<i>Grandma Toyo isn't my only nemesis.</i>

303
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,333
You're too rough!

304
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:22,600
And you're doing it all wrong!
Follow the manual.

305
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,467
This nursing plan is terrible.
Rewrite it.

306
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,667
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,567
What part...

308
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,067
Think for yourself.

309
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:42,433
Remake the bed. This is too messy.

310
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,833
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:47,533
I can't believe you're a housewife.

312
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:51,967
<i>The hospital is full of enemies.</i>

313
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:57,100
Someone...take my blood pressure...

314
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,333
I'm sorry.

315
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,867
No, I'm sorry.

316
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,167
You're Akiko, right?

317
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,333
Shall I push you?

318
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:15,167
How long have you been here?

319
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,133
Two months.

320
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:22,167
You were in an accident, right?
You're Keita's patient.

321
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,433
Keita seems to be interested in rehab.

322
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,400
But I don't know when
I'll be able to walk again...

323
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,933
Maybe never...

324
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,000
Don't be so pessimistic!
Keita will be sad.

325
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,000
Kotoko...

326
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,067
How do you feel about Keita?

327
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,400
Keita?

328
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,733
No, nothing.

329
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,500
What is it? Tell me...

330
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,867
Stop it!

331
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:01,533
I'll be fine!

332
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:13,833
<i>Maybe patients just don't like me.</i>

333
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,033
Naoki!

334
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,700
A nice photo, right?

335
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,033
Why do you have a picture of him?

336
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,467
Lookie here.

337
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,300
I have plenty more.

338
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,700
No!

339
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:01,100
I don't even have a photo of Dr. Irie.

340
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,767
Can I reprint some of these?

341
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,333
No way.

342
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,867
I'm secretly admiring
Dr. Irie from afar.

343
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,033
What?

344
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:20,333
Why would I give one to his wife?

345
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,633
Dr. Irie!

346
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,500
Please... stop...

347
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,700
My chest...

348
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,100
My chest hurts.

349
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,100
What's wrong, Grandma Toyo?

350
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:49,100
Someone! Call a doctor!

351
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
Doctor! Doctor!

352
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:53,600
Have you seen a... A doctor!

353
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,433
What did you say? Just hurry!

354
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,267
Wait...

355
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,067
Grandma Toyo! I brought a doctor!

356
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,000
What happened? What's going on?

357
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,633
What are you all doing here?

358
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:13,267
Grandma... What about your chest?

359
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:16,933
Who said I had chest pain?

360
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:21,733
My heart aches for Dr. Irie

361
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,000
is what I said.

362
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,300
I didn't ask you to make
a huge deal out of it.

363
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,933
That's terrible...

364
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:35,167
I was so worried. You tricked me!

365
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,600
Are you calling me a liar?

366
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:44,433
You can't tell the difference between
a broken heart and chest pain?

367
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,133
And you call yourself a nurse?

368
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:56,433
I'm not a doctor. I'm a radiologist.

369
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm sorry!

370
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,933
Can I leave now?

371
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,633
I'm really sorry.

372
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,067
You...

373
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:16,267
Ms. Irie, what are you doing?

374
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:17,433
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:20,800
In an emergency,
you have to stay calm.

376
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:24,367
You should have taken her pulse
and checked her symptoms.

377
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,367
You said she tricked you?

378
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,133
Yes...

379
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,200
Come with me!

380
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,433
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:56,367
Hey.

382
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,433
Naoki...

383
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,967
You caused another panic?

384
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:14,133
I'm losing confidence.

385
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,900
I'm doing my best

386
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,733
but Grandma Toyo
doesn't appreciate it.

387
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:23,567
I actually got mad at her.

388
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:30,900
She doesn't take me seriously at all.
It's pitiful.

389
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,933
I'm exhausted...

390
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,200
Are you going to quit?

391
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:44,967
That's one solution.

392
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,467
I've been meaning to tell you that.

393
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:55,100
You want to be a nurse
because I'm going to be a doctor.

394
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:59,967
Maybe that's not enough of a reason.

395
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:05,033
Look at you. You're at your limit.

396
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,633
If it's too hard for you,

397
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,133
you should quit now.

398
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,367
Ms. Irie.

399
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:42,167
I want you to stay away from
Mrs. Yoshida's room from now on.

400
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:47,333
You can't let a patient control you.

401
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:52,067
You need to spend time
with other patients, too,

402
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,767
or you won't get any training.

403
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,433
It'll be easier for you.

404
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,200
She's a little too challenging
for a trainee.

405
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,033
<i>But...</i>

406
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,100
<i>I don't want it to end like this.</i>

407
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,733
Grandma Toyo.

408
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:24,733
Are you sleeping?

409
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,400
What?

410
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,933
Starting tomorrow...

411
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,767
I won't be in charge of you anymore.

412
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:43,900
I wanted to say goodbye.

413
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,500
I guess you and I just didn't get along.

414
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:57,300
I wonder why.

415
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,733
It makes me sad.

416
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:09,433
Sorry for being such a nuisance.

417
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,800
Can't you even look at me
to say goodbye?

418
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,367
Are you crying?

419
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,700
What is it...?

420
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,800
Oh no! You have a fever!

421
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,167
This is nothing...

422
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:31,167
Why didn't you call me
when you're feeling sick?

423
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:34,333
You call me for silly things,
but not when it counts!

424
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,100
Are you stupid?

425
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,667
I'll never be indebted to you.

426
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,500
Too late!

427
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,800
Wait, okay? I'll go call a doctor.

428
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,167
Wait for me!

429
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:59,833
She's coming down with pneumonia.
Give her oxygen.

430
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,033
Yes.

431
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:13,167
<i>She may have actually</i>
<i>been in pain this morning.</i>

432
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:18,033
<i>If only I had taken her vitals</i>
<i>like Nurse Hosoi said...</i>

433
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,733
Your mother isn't doing too well.

434
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,000
She has a high fever and...

435
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:29,767
Hello?

436
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,167
How was it?

437
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,933
They won't come if it's just a fever.

438
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,733
Really?

439
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,167
They said to call if it gets really bad.

440
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:47,700
I can't believe it! It's their mother!

441
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:50,067
That's terrible...

442
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,733
It's not uncommon.

443
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,700
People don't want to take care
of the elderly.

444
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,100
They treat hospitals
like senior homes.

445
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,567
They haven't come once
since you've been here, right?

446
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,000
You're right...

447
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:10,233
She gave you a hard time...

448
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:13,800
but maybe she's just lonely.

449
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:17,933
Veteran nurses know
how to handle her,

450
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,567
but you react to everything she says.

451
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,300
It was probably fun for her.

452
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,633
Nurse!

453
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:48,333
Can I stay with Mrs. Yoshida tonight?

454
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,767
Don't worry. I've already
prepped the night nurse.

455
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:54,667
-But...
-In any case...

456
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,933
Trainees can't do the night shift.

457
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,367
But!

458
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,533
Those are the rules.

459
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,167
-Nurse Saeki.
-Nurse Hosoi.

460
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,867
What did Mrs. Yoshida's family say?

461
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:07,533
They're not coming.

462
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,433
That's a problem.

463
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:16,633
If only there was someone,
like a friend...

464
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,700
We could ask them to stay with her.

465
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,533
Right?

466
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,467
A friend...

467
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,700
Does that mean...

468
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,767
Ms. Irie, what are you doing?

469
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,600
Training time is over.

470
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,133
Hurry up and change.

471
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,867
Yes, ma'am...

472
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:42,800
What you do after hours
is up to you.

473
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,067
Just don't let it interfere
with training tomorrow.

474
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,133
Excuse me!

475
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:15,400
Naoki.

476
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,800
How is she?

477
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,333
Her breathing is erratic.

478
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,300
Her fever is still high.

479
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,500
If only I could...

480
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,933
You did everything you could.

481
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:37,667
You have to trust in
her own strength to recover.

482
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,733
All you can do is stay by her side.

483
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

484
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm going home.

485
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,933
Thanks for dropping by.

486
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:56,600
Kotoko...

487
00:34:58,267 --> 00:34:59,467
Hang in there.

488
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,867
Thanks.

489
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,767
What's wrong, Grandma Toyo?
Are you in pain?

490
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,200
That's right...

491
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:48,000
You have neuralgia.

492
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,967
I hope this helps.

493
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:05,467
It's no fun when you're so quiet.

494
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:15,667
Did you husband look like Naoki?

495
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:21,267
There aren't many people
who are as handsome...

496
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:29,333
Maybe we have the same taste
in men.

497
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,633
Get off me!

498
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,367
Wake up already!

499
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,933
What kind of nurse falls asleep
on a patient?

500
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,167
What about your fever?

501
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:12,567
What fever? I never had one.

502
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,767
It's down...

503
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,067
Your fever is down! Thank goodness!

504
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,300
Let go of me!

505
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,067
I'm so happy.

506
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,500
The other day...

507
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:36,733
I was rude to you. I'm sorry!

508
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,433
Were you? I forgot.

509
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,600
Marina told me that

510
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,100
Keita had feelings for you and...

511
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,233
And I...

512
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,000
Marina? That big-mouth.

513
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,933
Does that mean you like Keita?

514
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,633
What? I...

515
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,700
I see.

516
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,167
Keita is a nag, but he's a good guy.

517
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,533
I'm rooting for you!

518
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:14,267
Kotoko...

519
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:19,800
But what about your feelings
for Keita...

520
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,967
Oh, no.

521
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,533
Actually I'm married to Dr. Irie.

522
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:29,933
What? Really?

523
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:37,267
We just got to know each other, Shion!

524
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,300
It can't be helped.
Life is full of goodbyes.

525
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,267
Work hard and become
a good nurse, bro.

526
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,167
I'm not a bro! A sis, maybe!

527
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,333
Thank you, Mana-rin!

528
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:01,833
Mana-rin?

529
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,167
From now on, Mana-rin,

530
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,600
and Koto-rin will be our top
two figurines!

531
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:16,533
Sorry.

532
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,933
Please forget about me.

533
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,100
I'm sorry!

534
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:33,133
Thanks to you, my bandages
were removed,

535
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:35,400
but I fell down again.

536
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,467
I'm over here.

537
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,067
I'm so pitiful...

538
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,667
Don't worry.

539
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:49,667
But can I see your wounds again?
So I can remember them?

540
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,267
Akiko, today is my last day.

541
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
Thanks for everything.

542
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:04,000
What's wrong? Are you okay?

543
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,433
You'll be fine.

544
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm sure you'll be able to walk again.

545
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,033
<i>I have to say goodbye</i>
<i>to Grandma Toyo.</i>

546
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:22,233
<i>It was an eventful two weeks.</i>
<i>I'm kind of sad...</i>

547
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:25,800
<i>But I have to part with a smile!</i>

548
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,700
Okay!

549
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,333
Grandma Toyo...

550
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,400
Wait a minute!

551
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,067
Why are you taking a photo with Naoki?

552
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,933
With his arm around you?

553
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,367
Shut up! I'm his special patient.

554
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:51,700
No fair!

555
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,333
Nurse Igarashi,
can you take one of me?

556
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,633
What? You're still in training!

557
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,100
-Please?
-No.

558
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,500
-Make an exception?
-No!

559
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,833
Let me borrow your camera then!

560
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,700
I think you chose a good one.

561
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,800
Right?

562
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,267
She's a little dense,

563
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,833
but she has guts.

564
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,400
Say, "cheese!"

565
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:56,933

-Rika is going to live with us.
-Naoki!

567
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:02,033
<i>What is this?</i>

568
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,500
I would have reserved you
before I left for America.

569
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:08,267
I feel a little left out, that's all...

570
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:11,000
What a little nasty cutie honey.

571
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,500
You have a strong marital bond!

572
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:15,833
That's right!

573
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:19,467
I'm Naoki Irie's wife!

574
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:23,433
{\an8}Naoki is a great kisser.
