1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:03,333
How did you do on the test?

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,633
Aced it.

3
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,133
Are you serious?

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:09,200
How do you ace a test like that?

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,367
Like what?

6
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:12,500
It was super hard.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,767
It was.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,467
Will you ace the next one?

9
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:34,467
Probably. If I study.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,733
What do you want?

11
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:41,600
What's wrong?

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,867
A stray cat's been following us.

13
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:45,933
Stray cat?

14
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:47,800
Whatever.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,167
Excuse me... Yuki!

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,600
I...

17
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,033
Well...

18
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:05,333
What?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,867
I'm Konomi Sagawa from F Class.

20
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:14,400
Sagawa from F...

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,167
Do you know this girl?

22
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:19,267
No.

23
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,567
You may not know who I am,

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,300
but I've known you for a long time...

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,033
So what?

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,567
I want to be your friend!

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,033
You're so popular, Irie!

28
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,333
No way.

29
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,000
Can't we be friends?

30
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,733
I don't want any stupid friends
from Class F.

31
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,867
What? You already told him?

32
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:00,933
Kotoko!

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,833
Sorry, but you're moving so fast!

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,100
You've never even
talked to him, right?

35
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,633
But I was the same way,
so I can't blame you.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,233
I was so encouraged
by our last conversation.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,000
I decided to "go for broke!"

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,167
I see! And what did Yuki say?

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,267
He'd think about it if I made
the top 100 on the upcoming test.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,100
Really? Sounds exactly like
what I've been through!

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,700
But it's okay now.

42
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:43,967
I think I'll give up on Yuki.

43
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,367
What?

44
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:50,767
I told Yuki how I felt.
That's enough for me.

45
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:56,967
And I'll never make the top 100 anyway.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,767
Why are you giving up?

47
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:02,367
You need to make the top 100?

48
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,933
Bring it on!

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,933
Kotoko, that's impossible.
How can I do that?

50
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,667
I'm in Class F!

51
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:18,867
I was in Class F too.

52
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,700
But I climbed my way
to 100 in the class!

53
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,833
Wow! Amazing!

54
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
There's nothing
you can't do if you try.

55
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,800
But even if I start cramming now,

56
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,467
the top 100...

57
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,333
Don't worry! I'll help you out.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,567
I'm half responsible anyway.

59
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,233
I'll help you study!

60
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,733
Really?

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Leave it to me!

62
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,333
I feel so motivated!

63
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,400
Watch out, Yuki! She's going
to make the top 100!

64
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:50,500
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

65
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,800
{\an8}KISS OF GOODBYE

66
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:57,900
{\an8}Yes?

67
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:01,733
Hello.

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,300
What are you doing here?

69
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,500
Well...

70
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,267
Come in Konomi!

71
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,700
Kotoko!

72
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,300
You know her?

73
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,667
Kind of.

74
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:19,233
I'm going to tutor her from today.

75
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,833
What? You?

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,100
Konomi, you just leave it to me!

77
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay!

78
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,367
Let's go to my room!

79
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,033
Excuse me.

80
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,500
Hey!

81
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:41,367
My heart was pounding!

82
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:46,300
I'm so envious
you get to live with Yuki.

83
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,900
Really?

84
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:51,933
This may be your first step
toward a life with Yuki!

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,133
But first, the top 100!

86
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,433
Thanks for helping me!

87
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,533
No problem!
Okay, let's get to work!

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,300
What shall we study first?

89
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:06,600
Wait a minute ...

90
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,500
This is ...

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,200
I think you use this formula.

92
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,400
Excuse me, Kotoko?

93
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:23,233
It's been over an hour

94
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,467
and we're still on question 1.

95
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:33,300
Don't worry! We're almost there.

96
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,033
Here, have some snacks, okay?

97
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,067
I'm home.

98
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:44,700
Welcome back, Naoki!

99
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,567
How do you do.

100
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,833
Hello.

101
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,100
What are you doing?

102
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,833
This is Konomi, Yuki's classmate
at Tonan Middle School.

103
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,933
I'm helping her study
for her final exams.

104
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,033
I don't know if she's going
to be much help.

105
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,200
What are you saying?

106
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,333
I have to get Konomi
into the top 100 of her class.

107
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,567
Top 100.

108
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,933
That sounds familiar.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Doesn't it bring back memories?

110
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,067
This becomes 4.
And what is 4 squared?

111
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,900
We studied behind closed doors.

112
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,433
Now that I remember the moment

113
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:40,500
that was the beginning
of our relationship!

114
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,800
Behind closed doors.

115
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,967
Just don't waste your time.

116
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,933
Naoki, you're disturbing our studies!

117
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,733
All right.

118
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,733
Shall we start?

119
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,833
Yes!

120
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,033
What were you doing?

121
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,500
I was just walking by.

122
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,833
Why don't you help her study?

123
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,400
No way. She's too stupid.

124
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,267
And I'm the one who'll suffer
if she makes the top 100.

125
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,500
I see.

126
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,100
So it's complicated.

127
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,500
Not at all!

128
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,467
Kotoko.

129
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,800
Sorry.

130
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,000
I...

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,967
get so sleepy

132
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,467
when I look at mathematical formulas.

133
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,767
Kotoko!

134
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,000
Kotoko!

135
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,267
Don't go to sleep!

136
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,733
What should I do?

137
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Dinner.

138
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,933
I can't believe it.

139
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,100
What a tutor.

140
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,067
I'd better get going.

141
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,567
How far did you get?

142
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:59,167
We solved one problem.

143
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,533
In three hours?

144
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:01,700
Yes.

145
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,500
How many pages?

146
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,000
From here...

147
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:19,867
to there.

148
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,433
I can't let you waste more time.

149
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,600
It looks like you're in trouble.
I'll teach you.

150
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,167
But I'm not very smart.
You'll get frustrated.

151
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:40,900
I'm used to teaching kids like you.

152
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,633
The answer is...

153
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:55,800
2xy (3x - 2y...

154
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,200
close parentheses?

155
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,600
Correct.

156
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,367
Wow! I did it!

157
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,600
Hey!

158
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,400
Naoki? Yuki?

159
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,167
Was I sleeping?

160
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:24,133
Stop bothering my brother.

161
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,233
He's taking the National Medical
Board Examination soon.

162
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,267
What are you gonna do if he fails?

163
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,433
I'll teach you.

164
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:45,267
We have one week until final exams.

165
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,767
I'll tutor you after school until 9 pm.

166
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,433
Really?

167
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,200
What's going on?

168
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,433
Yuki is tutoring Konomi?

169
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,567
Thanks to you!

170
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,700
I don't know what's going on, but...

171
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,433
You got your foot in the door!

172
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:26,400
Now kill two birds with one stone!
Love and exams!

173
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,833
Yes!

174
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,000
You're starting to talk like mom...

175
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,533
What?

176
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,400
Nothing.

177
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,533
<i>I'm feeling really fired up!</i>

178
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,733
<i>How exciting!</i>

179
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,067
<i>Yuki's study sessions continued...</i>

180
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,567
Hey!

181
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,767
Correct.

182
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,800
Really? Wow!

183
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,400
We did it!

184
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Next!

185
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,133
Yes.

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,133
- 2y = 0.

187
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:39,433
y + 3 x (- 2y + 3).

188
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,767
Excuse me.

189
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,300
<i>And today is the final day.</i>

190
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,367
Konomi, Yuki. How about some tea?

191
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,967
Thank you.

192
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,233
How is it going?

193
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,033
Fine, thank you.

194
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,900
Yuki's a tough teacher.
Is he mean to you?

195
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,767
Oh, no.

196
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,300
I can't help it if she's stupid.

197
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:08,967
Don't say that!

198
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,133
Konomi, don't take it to heart.
Yuki may say that...

199
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,400
but boys are always mean
to girls they like.

200
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,233
Is that true?

201
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,967
Her? No way!

202
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,533
There he goes again.

203
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,967
Tadaa. Look at this.

204
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,533
What's that?

205
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,100
Open it.

206
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,467
These pictures...

207
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:52,033
Mom took them. Aren't they great?

208
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,767
Look how he's staring at you.

209
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,600
Don't be so stubborn, Yuki.
Just admit that you like her!

210
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:08,567
You look so cute together!

211
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,767
May I keep these?

212
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:13,900
Of course!

213
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:18,633
I'll keep them for good luck!
Thank you!

214
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:21,133
Are you kidding?

215
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,100
It's bad enough I have to tutor her.

216
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,200
You took pictures as well?

217
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,667
I...

218
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:34,633
I'm not your plaything!

219
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,433
You all make me sick!

220
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,333
I... I'm sorry.

221
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,067
I'm sorry!

222
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,067
Konomi!

223
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,667
What are you doing?

224
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:33,800
Yuki.

225
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,233
You're a mess.

226
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,733
Why?

227
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,933
I promised.

228
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,000
I'd tutor you every day

229
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,900
until 9 p.m. for a week until the exam.

230
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,667
It's still 7:30.

231
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,900
Don't try to break my promise.

232
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,633
Oh, yeah.

233
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,133
Sorry.

234
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:15,900
And...

235
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:19,867
You forgot something.

236
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,400
For good luck, right?

237
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,433
Thank you!

238
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,567
Let go!

239
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,200
Look!

240
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,500
All right.

241
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,267
This one, too!

242
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:49,200
Let go. We're going home.

243
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,767
That's enough, already.

244
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:57,100
But your mom asked me to.

245
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:01,667
It looks like Yuki may take
the same path as me.

246
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,633
Poor guy.

247
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,500
What poor guy?

248
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:24,767
Do you have your papers?
Your pencil case?

249
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,667
Yeah.

250
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,700
Calm down.
I'm the one taking the test.

251
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
I know, but...

252
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:36,500
Can't I go with you to take your test?

253
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,100
No.

254
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,233
Naoki, what if...?

255
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,867
What if what?

256
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,167
What if...?

257
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,167
You fail...

258
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:57,467
that means we can graduate
together next year.

259
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,700
It'll be fun! So don't worry!

260
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,233
I don't intend to.

261
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,100
See you.

262
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:12,167
You can do it, Naoki!

263
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:29,567
<i>The results of the National Exam</i>
<i>are going to be posted today.</i>

264
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:35,100
Stop pacing back and forth
like a bear in a cage!

265
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,300
But!

266
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,733
The results will be posted
in one minute! I can't stay still!

267
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,533
Calm down, Kotoko.

268
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,667
Relax! Breathe in and out.

269
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,233
It's 2:00.

270
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,567
How was it? Did you pass?

271
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:07,767
I...

272
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,667
No!

273
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,500
It's okay.

274
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:18,433
You have a long life ahead.
What's the rush?

275
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,533
If you stumble once or twice...

276
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,500
Are you kidding?

277
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,000
So...?

278
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,833
Congratulations, Naoki!

279
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,767
Congratulations!

280
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,367
Thank you.

281
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,933
Let's celebrate!

282
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,400
Congratulations, Naoki!

283
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,300
<i>Naoki is going to be a doctor!</i>

284
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,733
Kotoko!

285
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:57,733
Excuse me.

286
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,267
Mr. Irie!

287
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,300
It's not a bad offer. Think about it.

288
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:12,467
I will.

289
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,133
Well...

290
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,600
What shall I do?

291
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,833
Oh, yes!

292
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,500
We'll have his graduation party
at home!

293
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,533
Sounds good!

294
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,733
I want to invite lots of people

295
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,567
so please invite your
nursing school friends.

296
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh, okay.

297
00:22:57,533 --> 00:23:00,300
Yuki, please invite Konomi.

298
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,667
Why should I?

299
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:06,233
Because Konomi is your friend.

300
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,033
She's not my friend.

301
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,833
What do you mean?

302
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,633
She made the top 100
in the final exams!

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,433
Ninety-seven.

304
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,367
What?

305
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,300
Ninety-seven.

306
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,200
That's wonderful!

307
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,567
It's decided then!

308
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,400
I was a good tutor, that's why.

309
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,133
I see.

310
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,367
I felt the same way with Kotoko.

311
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:38,333
It's a big deal for someone
in Class F to make the top 100.

312
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:42,267
The power of love is amazing.

313
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,700
I told you! It was my tutoring.

314
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,600
The hardship of studying

315
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,833
was overcome by spending
time together and fostering love!

316
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,800
Now you and Konomi
have a special bond.

317
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,400
Kotoko! Shut up!

318
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,200
But at the end of the day,

319
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,267
you wanted to be friends
with Konomi, too.

320
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,267
I said...

321
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:09,267
When is Naoki's graduation?

322
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,167
March 20th.

323
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:16,767
I see. So he's going to be a doctor.

324
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,100
He's going to speak
on behalf of the graduates.

325
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,133
Right, Naoki?

326
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,700
What's wrong, Naoki?

327
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,933
What?

328
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,033
You're speaking at
the graduation, right?

329
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah.

330
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:37,433
I knew it!

331
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:40,100
I'll bring my video camera!

332
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,100
Yuki is graduating, too.

333
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:45,867
Maybe I should buy a new one!

334
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Kotoko.

335
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:54,733
I have something to tell all of you.

336
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,533
What? You sound so serious.

337
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,067
I met with my professor today.

338
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,367
I'm thinking of working
at a hospital in Kobe.

339
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,433
Kobe.

340
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:17,867
I thought you were going
to work at Tonan Hospital.

341
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,200
That's what I thought at first,

342
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,300
but I want to explore
some specialized fields

343
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,167
But...

344
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,867
The hospital in Kobe
is very specialized.

345
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,900
But! But...

346
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,667
Kobe is so far!

347
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,667
It's 6 hours there and back. How...?

348
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:43,467
Commuting is unreasonable.

349
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,767
Then...

350
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:49,700
I'm thinking of moving to Kobe.

351
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:55,233
Naoki! Are you serious?

352
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,867
Yeah.

353
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,500
I've already been invited
by a doctor in Kobe.

354
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:07,200
I'd study there for a few years
and then return.

355
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,167
Naoki! Then...

356
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:15,400
I have to find a school in Kobe!
Do I have time?

357
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,067
You should stay.

358
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,633
I'll go on my own.

359
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:26,567
You should stay here
and continue your studies.

360
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:33,067
I don't want to be apart!

361
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:39,100
Study here for a year
and come after you graduate.

362
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:43,800
No! I don't want to be
apart for a whole year!

363
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,500
I'm not that smart!

364
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,700
What if I don't graduate next year?
Then, it will be longer!

365
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Kotoko.

366
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:55,733
We'll be apart for too long!
I can't do it!

367
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,300
Do you expect me to wait
until you become a nurse

368
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,867
and then go to Kobe?

369
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,767
How could you say that, Naoki?

370
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:08,100
Think how Kotoko feels.
You're husband and wife!

371
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah.

372
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,767
You shouldn't be apart!

373
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:15,000
Don't just think about yourself.

374
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,433
I know.

375
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,533
You don't know.

376
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,333
You wouldn't understand.

377
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:31,200
Because I love you way more
than you love me.

378
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,333
You wouldn't know

379
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:35,267
how I feel.

380
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:39,067
How hard it would be
to be apart from you!

381
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:42,933
Because

382
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:48,467
you

383
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:54,133
would be totally fine without me.

384
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,167
When you made your decision

385
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,200
you never

386
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,933
even thought about me, did you?

387
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm the only one that would miss you!

388
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,167
Kotoko.

389
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:35,667
<i>What should I do...?</i>

390
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:39,567
<i>What should I do? What?</i>

391
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,800
<i>I'm making it hard for him.</i>

392
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,733
<i>I'm failing him as his wife.</i>

393
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,767
<i>I know. I know it.</i>

394
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,000
<i>But... But...</i>

395
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,567
<i>I don't want to be apart.</i>

396
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:35,833
Kotoko.

397
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,767
You didn't eat dinner again?

398
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,867
No.

399
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,033
But I'm sleepy.

400
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,067
Kotoko.

401
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,333
Good night.

402
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,500
Welcome home.

403
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,367
Thanks. You're still up?

404
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,600
Do you have a minute, dad?

405
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,700
How's Kotoko? Is she still upset?

406
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:39,467
Yes.

407
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:43,800
I was prepared for a bad reaction, but

408
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,400
when I actually see her like this...

409
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,133
She's crazy about you, that's why.

410
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:58,733
Dad.

411
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:02,400
I'm thinking of taking
Kotoko to Kobe with me.

412
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,300
Naoki... But...

413
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:11,833
If we find a nursing school now
she might be able to transfer.

414
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,067
But...

415
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:18,467
she won't know anyone
in a strange, new city.

416
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,667
Will she be able
to settle down and study?

417
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:27,100
I'll probably be so busy myself...

418
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,500
I wasn't confident

419
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,300
that I could think about
her well being, too.

420
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,633
I want her to become a nurse.

421
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,000
I thought

422
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,367
it may be better for us
to spend a year apart.

423
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:49,600
Naoki.

424
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:53,667
She

425
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,400
doesn't seem to realize

426
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,567
that I love her.

427
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,333
<i>Naoki.</i>

428
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,233
Representing the undergraduates,

429
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,500
Takayuki Miura of the Medical School.

430
00:32:57,067 --> 00:33:00,533
Address by Naoki Irie
of the Medical School.

431
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,000
Yes.

432
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,967
Farewell address.

433
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,967
When I look back on my life
at Tonan University,

434
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:30,800
many unforgettable memories
come to mind.

435
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:36,833
<i>How did I feel watching Naoki</i>
<i>at our high school graduation?</i>

436
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,500
<i>Jinko, Satomi and Kin-chan were there.</i>

437
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:52,333
<i>Naoki refused to give me his button.</i>

438
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,467
<i>But I still feel the same way.</i>

439
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,833
<i>I love Naoki!</i>

440
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,067
<i>All I know is one thing.</i>
<i>That I love Naoki.</i>

441
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,400
Representing the graduates
of the Medical School ...

442
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,400
Naoki Irie.

443
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,533
<i>That's one thing</i>
<i>that will never change.</i>

444
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,133
This is the engineering campus
he attended as a freshman.

445
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,700
Yuko Matsumoto was here, too.

446
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,800
Did you decide on your electives?

447
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:56,467
No, not yet.

448
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,033
And the Tennis Club.

449
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,667
We played a doubles match.

450
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Smooth.

451
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,500
The cafeteria where we ate lunch

452
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,367
and Naoki fought with Kin-chan.

453
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,267
What's with these portions?

454
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,433
Got a problem with it?

455
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:44,400
Kin-chan?

456
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,433
The medical lecture hall.

457
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:56,233
I used to watch Naoki from here.

458
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
There he is!

459
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:02,000
His aura outshines everyone else.

460
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,633
Yes!

461
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,333
<i>I won't be seeing him here anymore.</i>

462
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,267
Naoki.

463
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,933
Naoki.

464
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:23,067
Naoki!

465
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,200
What?

466
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,433
You're so loud.

467
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,067
How did you...?

468
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,733
I thought you might be here.

469
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,400
I have to talk to you.

470
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,033
It's probably better to talk here.

471
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:46,867
About Kobe.

472
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:47,933
I...!

473
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:53,700
I...

474
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,067
I'll become a nurse in one year.

475
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,800
Then I'll go to Kobe.

476
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,567
I promise! So...

477
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:09,100
Wait for me.

478
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,500
Don't

479
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,800
cheat on me.

480
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,533
Don't get mad

481
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,600
if I call you every day.

482
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,567
And...

483
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:30,867
And?

484
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,667
On my breaks

485
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,567
I'll come

486
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,933
Someone might come.

487
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,633
I don't care.

488
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,400
This is fine.

489
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,700
I'll see you off at the station.

490
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,233
That's okay.

491
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:52,433
You might stop the bullet train
if you come to see me off.

492
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,733
No I won't...

493
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,667
But...

494
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,567
maybe it will be easier
to say good-bye here.

495
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,867
Yeah. See you.

496
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,567
Call me when you get there.

497
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:13,467
Sure.

498
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:16,300
Your lunch.

499
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,067
I'll buy one!

500
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,800
Shin-Kobe is one station
after Okayama. Don't miss it!

501
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,133
You mean after Shin-Osaka.

502
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:42,867
Can I go now?

503
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,633
Sure.

504
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:49,467
How about a good-bye kiss?

505
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,400
Just joking.

506
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,600
Study hard.

507
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,600
You too, Naoki!

508
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,900
Yeah.

509
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:58,933
You can do it, Naoki!

510
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,367
You can do it, Kotoko.

511
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:24,367
We can...

512
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:26,200
do it.
