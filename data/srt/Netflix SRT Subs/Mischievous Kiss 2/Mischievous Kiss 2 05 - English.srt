1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,400
Ta-da!

2
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:04,600
"Congratulations..." You passed?

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:09,400
<i>I, Kotoko Irie, passed the examination</i>

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,933
<i>to transfer to the nursing school!</i>

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,433
<i>And for my reward,</i>

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:20,400
<i>a dream date with Naoki.</i>

7
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,033
Couples who ride in these boats
are destined to part ways.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,467
What?

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,767
What do you want to do?
We're already on the boat.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,200
Why didn't you tell me
before we got on?

11
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,700
I would never have--

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,733
This is the kind of date
you envisioned, right?

13
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,000
You and me... on a boat.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,100
Naoki, how did you...?

15
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:56,133
I'd never agree on a date
exactly as you planned it,

16
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,633
but you stayed up all night
planning it.

17
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,467
The least I could do was
make part of it come true.

18
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,233
What do you want to do?

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,400
Believe in a stupid jinx
and get off the boat?

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,867
Naoki...

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,133
Or...?

22
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,900
TONAN UNIVERSITY
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT

23
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,200
A white lab coat!

24
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,567
Hello.

25
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:02,600
<i>This is my first step</i>
<i>to becoming a nurse!</i>

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,167
<i>And...</i>

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,567
<i>our departments are right next</i>
<i>to each other.</i>

28
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,333
There it is!

29
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:27,733
"202, Department of Nursing."

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,933
Okay!

31
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,267
Good morning!

32
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,167
Who's that?

33
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:46,000
<i>Oh, yeah. I don't know anyone here.</i>

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,733
<i>Plus, everyone is three years younger</i>
<i>than me.</i>

35
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,567
Excuse me.

36
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,333
Thank you. Thank you.

37
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,400
Are you new here?

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,167
<i>She's so cute!</i>

39
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:17,300
Yeah. I transferred
from the Literature Department.

40
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,967
You must really want to be
a nurse to transfer midway.

41
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,367
Yeah. I guess.

42
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm Tomoko Ogura. Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,600
I'm Kotoko Irie. Same here.

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,167
Good morning.

45
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,400
Good morning.

46
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,100
Today is the first day of a new year.

47
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:44,200
This year, you'll get
some practical experience as a nurse.

48
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,600
You will work in groups of five.

49
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,533
I expect you to work as a team.

50
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,167
I'll read the names now.

51
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,767
-Group? Naoko Saeki.
-Here.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,600
<i>It's finally started. Wait for me, Naoki!</i>

53
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:05,200
<i>I'm going to be a nurse</i>
<i>that you can be proud of!</i>

54
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,667
-Scalpel.
-Yes.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,067
-Wipe my sweat.
-Yes.

56
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,167
Good work.

57
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,433
Thanks to you, Dr. Irie,
the surgery was a success.

58
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,667
Thanks to my capable nurse.

59
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,167
I'm not really...

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,400
I hope you'll continue to support me.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Of course!

62
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,733
<i>Kotoko Irie.</i>

63
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,333
Ms. Irie?

64
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,433
Kotoko.

65
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,167
Yes! I vow to support you!

66
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,633
Daydreaming in the first class
of the year?

67
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,867
You'd better shape up!

68
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,733
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,067
We're both in Group 2.

70
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,100
Really?

71
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,200
Thank goodness!

72
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:10,033
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

73
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,867
{\an8}I'll introduce you
to the other members.

74
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,067
{\an8}EXTREME!? MATES IN WHITE COAT

75
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,167
{\an8}Everyone.

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,267
This is our newest member.

77
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,333
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

78
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,300
<i>They're kind of intimidating.</i>

79
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,033
This is Kotoko Irie.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,167
How do you do? I'm Kotoko Irie.

81
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:42,933
I transferred to the nursing school
to follow my dream.

82
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,867
Nice to meet you.

83
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,767
I'm Marina Shinagawa.
So, what's your dream?

84
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,767
Well...

85
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,633
Do you have your eye on a guy
in the medical school?

86
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,033
You do?! Me too!

87
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,233
I'm going to marry a doctor
and become rich!

88
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,433
Marina! Purge that foul idea
from your head!

89
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,067
You're tainting a sacred profession.

90
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:16,167
I like rich, intelligent men.

91
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,667
I want children with superior DNA.

92
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,967
People like you are the bane
of the medical field.

93
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,367
Shut up! We're not all fanatics like you!

94
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,933
You're so dispassionate!

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,533
You're too passionate!

96
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,633
Calm down, both of you.

97
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,933
Don't mind them.
They're always like this.

98
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,267
This passionate guy is Keita Kamogari.

99
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,433
I'm going to be
the best nurse in Japan.

100
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,067
I'll do whatever it takes.

101
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,600
So noble for someone so young.

102
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,067
Hey...

103
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,067
You're not related
to that other "Irie," are you?

104
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
What kind of reaction is that?

105
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,767
Are you... a man?

106
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,400
How rude. I'm a woman at heart.

107
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:13,467
I'm Motoki Kikyo.
You can call me Moto-chan.

108
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,267
Moto-chan?

109
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:22,100
You're not related to Irie
in the medical school, are you?

110
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:26,333
-Irie in the medical school?
-What?!

111
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Don't you know
the super-elite Naoki Irie?

112
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:34,467
Naoki Irie... I've heard of him.

113
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,933
Right? He's a total hottie
as well as a genius!

114
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,933
You'll never find a man
so close to perfection.

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
He's so good-looking!
And so intelligent!

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,767
That's right. Moto-chan started
a Naoki Irie Fan Club.

117
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,233
I'm a member, too.

118
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,133
He meets all my criteria.

119
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,067
Wait a minute.

120
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,433
Criteria?

121
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,133
Is that how you see Mr. Irie?

122
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,767
You're the same!

123
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:14,600
I'm not so calculating.
My feelings for him are pure.

124
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,700
Give up. It's hopeless.

125
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:23,400
What did you say?! All is fair in love!

126
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,333
But...

127
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:31,600
isn't Naoki Irie married?

128
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:33,900
How do you know?

129
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,700
A rumor! I heard a rumor.

130
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,133
Can you believe it?

131
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,400
He forsook me and got married.

132
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,867
Rumor says his wife was
his classmate in college.

133
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,733
It's unforgivable.

134
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,633
What sort of selfish girl
would monopolize him?

135
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,767
Only a beauty and a genius like him,
of course!

136
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,967
I'd love to see her face.

137
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,900
NURSING PRACTICE ROOM

138
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:13,067
Let's take your blood pressure.

139
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:19,600
Let's visit Mr. Irie at his house today.

140
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,900
I'm in! Are you, Tomoko?

141
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:27,300
Moto-chan, you succeeded
in finding his address.

142
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,933
Of course.

143
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,567
As a president of the fan club,
I want to check out his wife.

144
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:33,733
<i>What...?</i>

145
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,333
<i>They're coming over?</i>

146
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,500
<i>What should I do?</i>

147
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:43,267
<i>I'm Naoki Irie's wife!</i>

148
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,667
<i>But if they find out,</i>
<i>I'll be ostracized.</i>

149
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,667
<i>For the next three years,</i>

150
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:53,000
<i>I'll have to pretend</i>
<i>I don't know him.</i>

151
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,533
<i>Poor me.</i>

152
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,133
Hey! Isn't that enough pressure?

153
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,767
Look. My arm is turning purple.

154
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,733
Don't be mad. It's not good
for your blood pressure.

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
Who's making me mad?!

156
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,700
It won't happen again.

157
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:18,467
I didn't want to be in your group.

158
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
That's funny...

159
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,267
Ow! Stop, stop, stop!

160
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,767
Are you trying to stop my circulation?

161
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,867
But you don't have a pulse!

162
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,567
Your...

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,333
stethoscope is backwards.

164
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,467
Is that intentional?

165
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,400
Sorry! One more time--

166
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,500
Enough! What if I was a real patient?

167
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:58,167
Don't get so mad!
Everyone makes mistakes.

168
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,933
But you've made three already.

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,367
I think it's four.

170
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,867
Six, to be exact.

171
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:11,500
Your intentions aren't serious.
That's why nothing is sinking in.

172
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,600
My intentions are serious!
I want to support Naoki!

173
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:21,067
Why would you support Mr. Irie?

174
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,233
Because...

175
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,100
Because...

176
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,833
I'm...

177
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,567
I'm Naoki Irie's wife!

178
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,467
What utter nonsense!

179
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,300
You're hilarious!

180
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,200
Don't laugh!

181
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, okay. Talk is for free, right?

182
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,067
Then I'm Naoki Irie's wife, too.

183
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,500
But it's true!

184
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,067
Excuse me.

185
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,333
Mr. Irie!

186
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,267
Kotoko.

187
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,000
You forgot this.

188
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,067
Mom said to give it to you.

189
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,233
See you.

190
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,533
Mr. Irie!

191
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,567
Ko... to... ko...

192
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,367
I told you it was true.

193
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,167
Didn't you say, "I've heard of him"?

194
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:45,267
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to lie.

195
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,700
I was trying to find a way...

196
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>Now I'll be a pariah.</i>

197
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:58,500
You don't need to apologize.

198
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,100
We're not mad at all.

199
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:09,500
If you're his wife, we still have hope.

200
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:14,333
I thought he was so inaccessible,

201
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,767
but this means we stand a chance!

202
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,067
Right?

203
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,600
<i>What does that mean?</i>

204
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,500
Naoki!

205
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,500
-Mr. Irie!
-Naoki!

206
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:37,200
<i>Now I can proudly say</i>
<i>that I'm Naoki's wife.</i>

207
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,433
Watch carefully.

208
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:50,800
All done.

209
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,500
You can do it, Kotoko.

210
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,600
Got it.

211
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,600
<i>I bonded with my group members,</i>

212
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:03,200
<i>and I was enjoying</i>
<i>this challenging, yet fulfilling time.</i>

213
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,700
<i>But the biggest challenge</i>
<i>was still ahead of me!</i>

214
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,933
The injection spot is
three fingers below

215
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,367
the central deltoid,
so right around here.

216
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,867
<i>Oh, no.</i>

217
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,367
<i>I hate shots more than anything.</i>

218
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,767
A green light comes on
when you've hit the right spot.

219
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:36,100
<i>The sight of... blood!</i>

220
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,233
Is that clear?

221
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
Let's practice administering injections.

222
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,400
You'll have an exam next week.

223
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,867
If your entire group gets it right,
you can go to lunch.

224
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,033
Okay.

225
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,233
Let's be the first to finish!

226
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,233
Let's go.

227
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:03,467
This feels so realistic.

228
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,900
Let's get this over with
and go to lunch.

229
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,967
-Lend me your arm, Keita.
-What?

230
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,867
Wow, your arm is pretty muscular.

231
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,967
Can you do it?

232
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:19,633
Of course. Who wants to go first?

233
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Can I go first?

234
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,033
Sure.

235
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,200
Aren't you scared?

236
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,433
Not at all.

237
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:29,500
Hey, wait up!

238
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:33,267
-The syringe.
-Yes, ma'am.

239
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,200
How was it?

240
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,533
Tomoko passed.

241
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,433
You're good at it, Marina!

242
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,567
I did it!

243
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,300
You're the last one, Kotoko.

244
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,800
Okay.

245
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,900
Concentrate!

246
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:20,867
Yes, sir! Here I go.

247
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,767
That's my shoulder!

248
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,900
-The fake one!
-Oh, yeah.

249
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,900
-Can you do it?
-No problem.

250
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,867
Who gives shots
with their eyes closed?

251
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:46,067
But I'm scared to look.

252
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,933
Take it out of the arm!

253
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,233
Not done yet?

254
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,567
We're the only ones left.

255
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm starving.

256
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,100
This time, for sure.

257
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,500
Hey! How many times
do I have to tell you?

258
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:24,000
Pinch the arm
and stick the needle in!

259
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:28,500
I know, but this device
doesn't like me. Sorry.

260
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,233
How many times
do I have to say it?

261
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:39,300
We're always in last place,
thanks to you.

262
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,933
If you're really sorry,

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,900
arrange a med school mixer
and invite Mr. Irie.

264
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,367
But...

265
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,567
I can't believe it.

266
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,133
-Naoki!
-Mr. Irie!

267
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,433
Kotoko.

268
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,533
If you can't handle this,
I hope we never work together.

269
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,233
I doubt she'll even pass
the national exam.

270
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,367
Do something about it.

271
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,767
At this rate,
she'll never become a nurse.

272
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,467
"Never"?

273
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,300
You're a genius, right? Do something.

274
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,467
I'm not going to become a doctor
for her sake.

275
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,767
If she doesn't have what it takes,
so be it.

276
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,467
It has nothing to do with me.

277
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,067
But she's your wife.

278
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,867
Why don't you do something about it?

279
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,500
Sorry for intruding.

280
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,433
He's so cool.

281
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,267
What's his problem?

282
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,700
Don't you feel anything from this?!

283
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,667
Why'd you marry him anyway?

284
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,033
For his looks? For status?

285
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,700
Calm down, will you?

286
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:58,067
It's fine... because it's true.

287
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:01,733
He's always like that. I'm used to it.

288
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:05,067
Naoki doesn't baby me.

289
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:08,900
That's not what I mean!
Married couples...

290
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:13,100
should encourage each other
and help each other.

291
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,267
There's so much more to it!

292
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,900
They should work together!

293
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,167
With encouragement...

294
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,200
I think Keita really idealizes marriage.

295
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Anyway, I'm relieved.

296
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:35,967
Mr. Irie doesn't seem
to love you that much.

297
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,333
No! He does!

298
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,467
<i>Am I really cut out to be a good nurse?</i>

299
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,100
<i>And...</i>

300
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,233
We're always in last place,
thanks to you.

301
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,000
If you're really sorry,

302
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:09,500
arrange a med school mixer
and invite Mr. Irie.

303
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:15,600
I'm sure Naoki won't go to a mixer.

304
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,967
This onion... is making me teary.

305
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:26,333
What's wrong, Kotoko?
Are you crying?

306
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,933
Becoming a nurse isn't easy.

307
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,233
I empathize.

308
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,300
You're doing something challenging
you've never done for Naoki.

309
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,200
You're so devoted, Kotoko.

310
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,333
I'll tell you something
to make you happy.

311
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:54,567
Dad has some land up in Hokkaido.

312
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,800
There's a village without a doctor.

313
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,733
Working in a big hospital is nice,

314
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,100
but wouldn't it be fun to run
a small clinic together?

315
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,567
Just the two of us?

316
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:09,733
Yes!

317
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,833
The villagers will be so grateful,

318
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,833
and you can gaze
upon the stars at night!

319
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,967
Oh, my God!

320
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:20,967
That's enough.

321
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,800
I didn't know you were home, Naoki.

322
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:29,533
I guess you didn't notice,
so immersed in your fantasy.

323
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:35,000
Who'd run a clinic with a nurse
that can't even administer a shot?

324
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:41,500
Kotoko is trying her best
to juggle housework and schoolwork.

325
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,767
Tonight's dinner is your favorite,
beef stew.

326
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,967
I'm making plenty
so we can eat it again tomorrow.

327
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,267
I won't be home tomorrow.

328
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,833
Eating out?

329
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,067
The guys at the medical school
are going drinking.

330
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:04,300
You never go on group outings!

331
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,100
How many of you are going?

332
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Six or seven?

333
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,033
Where?

334
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,000
Shibuya.

335
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:23,700
Oh, Shibuya!

336
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,600
Which restaurant?

337
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,833
How should I know?
I didn't arrange it.

338
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,533
We're all here at 6:59 p.m. Let's go.

339
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,333
Welcome!

340
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm Funatsu.
I have a 7 p.m. reservation.

341
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:52,233
We've been expecting you,
Mr. Funatsu.

342
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,200
Your guests are waiting.

343
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:58,533
They're in the back.

344
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,867
What a coincidence!

345
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:06,400
Aren't you med students
at Tonan University?

346
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:09,967
We're second-year nursing students!

347
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,767
Is it okay if we join you?

348
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,367
Sure! Right, guys?

349
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:17,600
It's more fun with girls in the mix.

350
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,933
What a coincidence, huh, Irie?

351
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,300
Kotoko!

352
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,467
Naoki! What a coincidence.

353
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,633
Coincidence? You planned this.

354
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,933
It's a coincidence!

355
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,833
Is that why you called me last night?

356
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,067
I knew it was strange when you asked me
where we were going.

357
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,433
Shall we sit down, everybody?

358
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,100
Come on. Let's sit down!

359
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,200
Here you go, Mr. Irie!

360
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,767
Thanks.

361
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,233
-Here you go.
-Thanks!

362
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,400
You're so thoughtful, Marina.

363
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:08,900
I do it out of habit, I guess.

364
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,967
So feminine!

365
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,733
So fake.

366
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,900
She never acts like this with us.

367
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,100
She's the type that changes
in front of men.

368
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:21,333
Thank you for waiting.
This is our famous sizzling steak.

369
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:24,400
Looks good!

370
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,867
Tomoko, you're so good with knives.

371
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:49,533
I bet you cook all the time.

372
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,500
I don't enjoy cooking.

373
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,167
I enjoy cutting meat.

374
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,833
That's why I chose nursing school.

375
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,967
So I can cut, cut, cut away!

376
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:12,233
But nurses don't use scalpels on people.

377
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
That's true.

378
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,533
Really?!

379
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,967
I'll never wield a scalpel?

380
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:28,467
So, I had a scalpel custom made
for nothing?

381
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:40,433
She seemed so angelic.

382
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,100
Never judge a book by its cover.

383
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,400
-Mr. Irie! You're too close!
-And you're heavy!

384
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:55,900
Heavy? Are you kidding?

385
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:59,000
<i>He looks like he's having fun.</i>

386
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,667
<i>Letting pretty girls serve him!</i>

387
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:10,000
It looks like your husband
forgot he was married.

388
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,867
He's always popular with girls.

389
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:24,400
Mr. Funatsu,
it's a good opportunity for you

390
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:27,667
to talk to some girls. Lighten up!

391
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,833
I have no interest in such things.

392
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,600
Don't be a prude!

393
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:35,267
Look! Cute girls left and right!

394
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,300
Mr. Funatsu!

395
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,267
Here you are! May I sit next to you?

396
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,533
I... suppose.

397
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:49,233
My name is Marina Shinagawa.
Nice to meet you.

398
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:56,000
I've always wanted to talk to you.

399
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,200
Do you have a hobby?

400
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:01,733
Reading medical books.

401
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,433
What do you do on your day off?

402
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,900
I read medical books.

403
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:14,200
-So, you never go out?
-Sometimes.

404
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:15,733
Where do you go?

405
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,033
I visit parasite museums
and mummies around the country.

406
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,367
I see.

407
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,533
See you later.

408
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,833
-Wait, wait, wait!
-What?

409
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,733
Stay a little longer. He's just shy.

410
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,367
Are you kidding? I like smart guys,
not mummies!

411
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:51,500
There she goes...
She's not right for you anyway.

412
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:54,233
Shall I introduce you to someone else?

413
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,933
How about that girl?
She looks like your type.

414
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,500
So? So? So?

415
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,467
Miss Marina.

416
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,733
I like Miss Marina.

417
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:07,733
But you acted
so disinterested just now!

418
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,767
I always act like that
in front of girls I like.

419
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,267
Feel my wildly beating heart.

420
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, my God!

421
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,300
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Funatsu?

422
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,400
Hey, Kotoko!

423
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:31,833
What now, Marina?

424
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:38,100
Mr. Funatsu will always be lacking,
compared to Mr. Irie.

425
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,400
He'll always be Number 2.

426
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,033
Damn it!

427
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,700
It's always the same!
Irie this and Irie that.

428
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,833
Irie has a good-for-nothing wife!

429
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,633
Listen, Marina Shinagawa!

430
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,900
I will beat Irie and become Number 1.

431
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:56,800
Take back what you just said
and go out with me!

432
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:02,867
-Did you hear me?!
-Okay. Calm down.

433
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,733
Keita Kamogari!

434
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:17,633
What?

435
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,500
You know...

436
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:23,633
I always wanted to tell you this.

437
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,533
Despite my appearance,

438
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,033
I'm three years older than you!

439
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,733
Three... Three! Got it?

440
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,867
So?

441
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:38,533
So...

442
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,100
show me a little respect!

443
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,200
You're always yelling at me.

444
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,100
That's cold!

445
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,633
What are you doing?!

446
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,600
It's cold. It spilled.

447
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,100
You spilled it, you mean.

448
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,367
I'm sorry.

449
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,367
Wipe me up.

450
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:03,733
Done.

451
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,200
You're clumsy and you never learn.

452
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:10,133
If you want to be respected,
act your age.

453
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,167
Huh? What did you say?

454
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,667
Ow. That hurts.

455
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,200
Hey.

456
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,267
Hey!

457
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,267
Don't fall asleep here.

458
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,367
Kotoko's fast asleep.

459
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,567
Ko-to-ko.

460
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:54,067
It's no use. She's dead to the world.

461
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,467
Shall we call Mr. Irie?

462
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:58,100
Never mind. I'll take her home.

463
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,100
I didn't drink, and I drove here.

464
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,100
But shouldn't we leave Kotoko
to her husband?

465
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:06,367
What for? He's having his own fun.

466
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,833
Did Kotoko fall asleep?

467
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,900
Mr. Irie! Yes, she did.

468
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,467
Sorry, I'll take her home.

469
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:19,267
Hey, Kotoko!

470
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,633
Let's go.

471
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,967
Kotoko, let's go home.

472
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:26,700
He said, "Let's go home!"

473
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,767
Never mind. I'll drive her home.

474
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,033
Who are you?

475
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,533
Keita Kamogari,
from the nursing school.

476
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,967
Your wife is always causing me trouble.

477
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,233
Sorry about that.

478
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,467
I'll get her home safely.

479
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:48,000
Why you don't go back
to your harem?

480
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,200
You have no interest in her.

481
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,833
Shut up.

482
00:33:55,967 --> 00:34:00,567
Whether I'm interested in her
or not is none of your concern.

483
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,233
Stay out of it.

484
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:05,733
What...?

485
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,000
Shots!

486
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,433
Who cares about stupid shots?

487
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,367
I'll master it right away...

488
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,500
Are you up?

489
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,067
It's Naoki!

490
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,633
Let's go, Kotoko.

491
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,567
Okay!

492
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,800
You're such a baby.

493
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:39,833
Mr. Irie.

494
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,433
Kamogari...

495
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:53,300
Don't talk about Kotoko
as if she's yours.

496
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,067
What's come over you, Keita?

497
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,433
You were so confrontational.

498
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:14,067
I don't like him... Naoki Irie.

499
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,133
Naoki...

500
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,067
What?

501
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:27,833
Naoki!

502
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,933
She's talking in her sleep.

503
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,133
Shots...

504
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,933
Dreaming about shots?

505
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:49,767
Keita Kamogari...

506
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,467
Me again!

507
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:01,333
I'm cursed.

508
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:06,567
What are you talking about?
It's not a real shot.

509
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,933
She's going to use the fake arm.

510
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
Idiot!

511
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:14,967
It's a fake arm, but the hand
holding the needle is shaking.

512
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,333
You have no idea how scary that is.

513
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,633
Don't worry, it'll be fine!

514
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,433
I practiced a hundred times with a doll!

515
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,900
Leave it to me!

516
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:36,133
You have 15 minutes. Begin now.

517
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,933
Okay, first...

518
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,933
Pinch the arm and grab the muscle.

519
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:45,500
Okay.

520
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,400
Ow. That's my arm.

521
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,067
Sorry.

522
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,300
-Calm down.
-Right.

523
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,100
Okay. Ready?

524
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,467
Yeah.

525
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,600
Ow! Ouch!

526
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,800
-What are you doing?
-I poked myself.

527
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,767
You're not even wearing gloves.

528
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:22,567
Kotoko!

529
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,167
-Hey!
-Kotoko?

530
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,933
Kotoko!

531
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,667
Are you all right? Get up!

532
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:31,900
She's out cold.

533
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,833
I'm taking her to the health office.

534
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,433
-Thanks.
-Do you need help?

535
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,233
No. I can handle it.

536
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,367
Move!

537
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,000
Move!

538
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,733
Move!

539
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,433
Move!

540
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,400
Move it!

541
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:20,700
Out of my way!

542
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,433
Move!

543
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,867
Wasn't that Kotoko?

544
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,033
I wonder what happened.

545
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,167
And who was that?

546
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,733
Doctor! A patient!

547
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,733
No one's here.

548
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:57,267
She looks so peaceful.
Makes me want to faint.

549
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,033
You keep falling asleep on me.

550
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,800
What do you think you're doing?

551
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,833
You, again.

552
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,633
I haven't done anything.

553
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,300
Are you kidding me? With her?

554
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:54,033
It didn't look that way to me.

555
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,700
So, she fainted
and you carried her here?

556
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,300
Thanks for doing that. For her.

557
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:13,500
But I'm here now.
Go back to your training.

558
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,233
I was about to go anyway.

559
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,467
Kamogari.

560
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,767
I know that you're aware

561
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,767
that she and I are married.

562
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,200
Don't try...

563
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,200
anything with Kotoko.

564
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:48,900
I would be...

565
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:53,967
I just realized.

566
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:01,000
I'd take better care of Kotoko than you.

567
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:05,967
I'd love her more than you.

568
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,667
Is that right?

569
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,800
NEXT EPISODE
"A GENIUS AND JEALOUSY"

570
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,900
Naoki and I are going on a trip alone.

571
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:04,167
-I don't remember saying I'd go.
-Let's all go have fun!

572
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:05,800
Irie!

573
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:06,967
Naoki!

574
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,767
He's so nice.

575
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,300
And you're so cold!
You don't stand a chance!

576
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,767
Why don't you go home
with Kamogari, then?

577
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:20,133
<i>Why did it turn out this way?</i>

578
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,033
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

579
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,033
{\an8}I was serious when I said that.
