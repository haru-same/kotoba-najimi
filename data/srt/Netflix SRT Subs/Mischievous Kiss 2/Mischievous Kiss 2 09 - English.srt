1
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>When I wake up, Naoki is lying next to me.</i>

2
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,267
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,967
<i>Am I the luckiest girl in the world?</i>

4
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,533
<i>We've been married</i>
<i>for two and a half years,</i>

5
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:49,733
<i>but my love for Naoki</i>
<i>sets new records every day.</i>

6
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:58,500
Morning.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,767
Your face is all swollen.

8
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,700
It's not a pretty sight.

9
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,833
<i>Never mind what he just said.</i>

10
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,233
<i>I love him!</i>

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,167
Good morning!

12
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,500
Good morning, Kotoko.

13
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,200
It's spring break. You should sleep in.

14
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm still a housewife.

15
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:30,700
Oh, my!

16
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:35,167
<i>My mother-in-law is so sweet.</i>

17
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,733
Morning, honey. Morning, Kotoko.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,933
-Morning.
-Good morning, Dad.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,533
-How about some coffee?
-Thank you, Kotoko!

20
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:54,533
<i>So is my father-in-law.</i>

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,600
Kotoko! You washed my shirt
with my ID book in it!

22
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:01,867
Oops.

23
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,867
This won't fit into my pocket anymore.

24
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,000
<i>Let's skip over him.</i>

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
-Morning.
-Morning!

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,667
-Kotoko, can I have some coffee?
-Sure!

27
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,167
<i>And... And...</i>

28
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,000
<i>the best husband in the world.</i>

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
<i>I thought my happiness</i>
<i>would last forever...</i>

30
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:33,967
<i>until...</i>

31
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:39,833
Oh, I forgot to tell everyone.

32
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:44,500
Rika is coming
to live with us for a while.

33
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,167
-Rika?
-Rika?

34
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,667
She's back.

35
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,767
Yes, after seven years!

36
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:54,067
Who's Rika?

37
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,533
That's right. Kotoko hasn't met her.

38
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,267
She's Naoki and Yuki's cousin.

39
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,100
She's super brainy and beautiful,
unlike you.

40
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:15,200
She used to come over all the time
until their family moved to America.

41
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,733
Why is she coming to live with us?

42
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:24,033
Her family is moving back in May,
but Rika starts school in April

43
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,267
so she's coming back to Japan
a little early.

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:32,933
She's going to stay with us
until her family arrives.

45
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,567
So, Rika's coming back.

46
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:44,733
<i>I thought Yuki hated girls,</i>
<i>but he looks so happy.</i>

47
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,867
Speaking of Rika...

48
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:51,967
She used to win all those piano
and cooking competitions.

49
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,300
She's really a nice, cheerful girl.

50
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,500
She was talented,
ever since she was young.

51
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,333
So, Rika is like a perfect girl.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,067
She's the complete opposite of you,
Kotoko.

53
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:13,233
Think of her as a younger sister.

54
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,600
Sure!

55
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:30,433
These are so heavy. My hands...

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,567
I'm almost home.

57
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:38,833
Oh, no!

58
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:42,400
-I'm sorry!
-No, it's my fault!

59
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,100
-Excuse me.
-Sorry, thanks!

60
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,567
Were you coming to our house?

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,900
Are you Rika? You're Rika, right?

62
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,100
No, I'm not.

63
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:10,933
Sorry.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,500
Thanks.

65
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,400
-I'm very sorry.
-No.

66
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,600
Are you Yuki's friend?

67
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:29,867
No.

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,700
Excuse me!

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,067
Wait a minute!

70
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,767
I'm home.

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,933
Hi there.

72
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:52,133
-Watch where you're going.
-I was.

73
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,933
-You ran right into me.
-Sorry.

74
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,167
<i>That girl was about Yuki's age.</i>

75
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,767
-Naoki.
-Yuki.

76
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:10,233
-Yuki, when I was outside--
-Naoki! Rika's here!

77
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,367
Hey, Rika!

78
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,767
<i>Wow... she's so cute.</i>

79
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,000
Naoki!

80
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,767
You're more handsome than ever.

81
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,167
And you're more beautiful.

82
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,267
<i>Wha...? What...?</i>

83
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
<i>What's going on?!</i>

84
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:44,333
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

85
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,467
{\an8}Thank you for having this dinner for me.

86
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,000
{\an8}HERE COMES A CUTIE LITTLE VIXEN!

87
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,767
{\an8}I'm glad to see everyone is well.

88
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,267
Today, we're celebrating
Rika's return to Japan

89
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,667
and her staying with us for a while.

90
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,033
Cheers!

91
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,967
Cheers!

92
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,067
-Thank you.
-Welcome home.

93
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:06,967
Cheers!

94
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,933
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,133
Nice to meet you, Kotoko.

96
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:13,833
Same here.

97
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,733
You start school tomorrow, right?

98
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,300
At St. Sumiregaoka Academy.

99
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,033
St. Sumiregaoka Academy?
That super selective school?

100
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,467
I lived nearby the school.

101
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:32,700
<i>You don't attend a school like that</i>
<i>just because you live nearby.</i>

102
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,333
You practically aced
the entrance exam, right?

103
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Aced the exam?

104
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,500
You could learn something from Rika.

105
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,267
I think Kotoko is way
more capable than me.

106
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,700
Kotoko? More than you?

107
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,433
It's easy to ace a test.

108
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,300
It's nearly impossible
to win Naoki's heart.

109
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:58,200
Oh, my! She may be right.

110
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,300
Naoki is so stubborn.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,467
We couldn't believe that
Naoki got married!

112
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,800
He had no interest in girls.

113
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,367
Kotoko, you must be incredible.

114
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,033
I worked pretty hard.

115
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,333
You pursued Naoki, right?

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,967
Yes, that's right.

117
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,600
I knew it. Otherwise...

118
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,633
If I only knew, I would have reserved you
before I left for America.

119
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,600
<i>I know they're cousins,</i>
<i>but she's hanging onto him way too much!</i>

120
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,200
Come now, Rika.

121
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:45,033
Naoki is a married man. Leave him alone.

122
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,100
Let's eat my lasagna before it gets cold.

123
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,433
There it is!

124
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,067
I love your lasagna!

125
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,067
Here you go.

126
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:01,467
That...

127
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,733
sounds like a real problem.

128
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,667
Really?

129
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,633
She's a fresh, young, high school student.

130
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,500
-Plus she's got beauty, brains and a body.
-Yes.

131
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:21,467
And... they're cousins
who grew up together.

132
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,167
They have a history
that you can't compete with.

133
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,133
She may embrace him...

134
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,100
and intimately call him "Naoki!"

135
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:37,333
What a formidable enemy.

136
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,567
Enemy?

137
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,500
Yes, enemy!

138
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,567
For you, and for me.

139
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,133
But, I don't think she has
romantic feelings for him.

140
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,533
Of course she does! What are you thinking?

141
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,367
We're talking about Naoki Irie!

142
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,500
-Really?
-I'm sure of it.

143
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,400
This parfait is delicious!

144
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:12,233
She's definitely cheerful
and seems like a good girl.

145
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:17,500
I feel a little left out, that's all.

146
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,500
Like I'm alienated.

147
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:21,900
I see.

148
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,767
Your biggest obstacle is...

149
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:29,867
his family.

150
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,500
-What?
-His family was always on your side.

151
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,533
Now they're all on her side.

152
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,167
Don't exaggerate.

153
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:44,067
You don't have the luxury
to be so magnanimous...

154
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,900
while everyone adores Rika.

155
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:49,767
Naoki...

156
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,967
could be taken away.

157
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,300
No!

158
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:59,867
And you'll be totally forgotten.

159
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,733
Moto-chan!

160
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,633
Thanks for dessert.

161
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,533
Kotoko!

162
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Rika.

163
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,800
So may guys tried to pick me up already.

164
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,800
Pick you up?

165
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,967
Guys here are so immature.

166
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,300
Oh, really?

167
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:39,700
Including the boys in my class.
Hot guys are non-existent here.

168
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,400
I guess...

169
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,700
I grew up with Naoki
so my standards are high.

170
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,867
You can't compare them to Naoki.

171
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,333
Kotoko.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,100
Can I...

173
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,567
have Naoki?

174
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,000
Why not?

175
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,433
Can I have him?

176
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,333
Rika, you must be...

177
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,633
You should have seen your face!
I was joking!

178
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,067
Joking. Joking, huh?

179
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:42,233
I can't let her get to me, but...

180
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,000
Who could that be? Mom?

181
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,433
Kotoko!

182
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,533
Rika! What is it?

183
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,700
Let's take a bath together.

184
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,000
Rika, I'd rather not.

185
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,867
Why not? We're both girls.

186
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,967
Well... I guess.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,967
What... a... body.

188
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,900
Kotoko...

189
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,700
were you the one who proposed?

190
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,267
Oh, no!

191
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,600
<i>Why do I always react to her?</i>

192
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,300
<i>I have to remain calm!</i>

193
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,967
<i>Be bold and confident!</i>

194
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:50,300
<i>She's just a high-school kid,</i>
<i>and I'm Naoki's wife.</i>

195
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,467
Can I ask another question?

196
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,767
What?

197
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:00,300
Is Naoki... a good kisser?

198
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,567
Why? I don't know.

199
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:15,700
I wouldn't really know.
I've only kissed Naoki and...

200
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,033
Oh, really?

201
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
Then you wouldn't know.

202
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,033
I've had several boyfriends in America.

203
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
We kissed a lot.

204
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,900
<i>No... I'm starting to feel faint.</i>

205
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,067
I think I'm done.

206
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,467
But... the best kisser I've ever known...

207
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,700
is Naoki.

208
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Naoki... is... a great kisser.

209
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,600
<i>What... did she just say?</i>

210
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,167
You're so lucky you get
to kiss him all the time.

211
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:15,500
I'd like to kiss him just one more time.

212
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,233
But there are all kinds of kisses.

213
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,933
Like smacks on the cheek
when you're small...

214
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,867
I was in fifth grade
and Naoki was in high school.

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
It was on the lips, of course.

216
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,500
<i>What?!</i>

217
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,767
I think it was the first kiss
for both of us.

218
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,100
<i>Liar!</i>

219
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,433
Kotoko.

220
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:53,367
<i>Naoki's first kiss wasn't with me.</i>

221
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,100
<i>It was with Rika.</i>

222
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,267
Kotoko!

223
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,733
<i>Someone... tell me it isn't true.</i>

224
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,467
<i>Naoki. Naoki.</i>

225
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,233
<i>Naoki.</i>

226
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,167
Kotoko... I'm going out with Naoki.

227
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:27,433
What? Naoki is married to me!

228
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,433
But we make a better couple.

229
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,167
And I kissed him first.

230
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:38,400
Right, Naoki?

231
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,667
Yeah... I guess so.

232
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,933
We were each other's first.

233
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:52,800
Leave her, and let's kiss.

234
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,667
Okay.

235
00:18:54,733 --> 00:19:00,900
No!

236
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,933
It was a dream.

237
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,933
I overslept!

238
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,300
Good morning, Kotoko.

239
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,933
Are you feeling okay?

240
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,067
You fainted yesterday.
You should sleep in.

241
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
I borrowed your apron.

242
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,067
You like omelets, right Naoki?
Shall I make you one?

243
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,267
-Sure.
-Me, too.

244
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,467
Okay! Leave it to me.

245
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,633
Rika, don't worry. I'll do it.

246
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,800
But I make a better omelet.

247
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,600
How do you know?

248
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,633
Just go back to sleep.

249
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,233
What's wrong, you two?

250
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll make it!

251
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:33,700
You want to know about Rika?

252
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,867
You must know about her.

253
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,200
Well...

254
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:46,800
We were like siblings
ever since we were small.

255
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,400
Does Rika...

256
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,800
like...

257
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,133
Naoki?

258
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,633
Who knows?

259
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,367
But... I like her a lot.

260
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,800
So, I asked her to live with us.

261
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,633
And she said to me...

262
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,400
"If I marry Naoki...

263
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,733
I can be your real sister."

264
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Marry...?

265
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:35,833
If I really wanted her to be my sister,

266
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:40,833
I would have to help her
get married to Naoki.

267
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,233
I remember promising her that.

268
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:49,567
Kotoko.

269
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,733
Can I...

270
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,033
have Naoki?

271
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,600
<i>She's been in love with Naoki</i>
<i>all this time.</i>

272
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,400
<i>Is she really in love?</i>

273
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:19,567
Okay.

274
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:21,833
This time...

275
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,967
You're up early, Kotoko.

276
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,267
You, too, Rika.

277
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,333
What's this breakfast?

278
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:06,067
They made it together.
You girls are so nice.

279
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,767
-Morning.
-Naoki!

280
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,667
Naoki!

281
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:18,367
This is really good. Try it.

282
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,200
A special breakfast. Try it.

283
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,233
I can't eat so much this early.

284
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,533
What? Please.

285
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,300
I made it just for you.

286
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,400
Oh, well.

287
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
Which one first?

288
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,933
Mine first.

289
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,367
It's bad.

290
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,400
Try mine.

291
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:03,333
-It's good.
-You've always liked omelets!

292
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,600
Don't give up, Kotoko!

293
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,533
<i>This is awful.</i>

294
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,733
Kotoko, coffee.

295
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,833
I'll get you some coffee.

296
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,000
No.

297
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,700
Kotoko makes good coffee.

298
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,500
I'll make some right away.

299
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,200
Kotoko.

300
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:52,800
Rika, you'll be late for school.

301
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:56,100
I...

302
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,533
I love Naoki.

303
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,800
I've loved him way longer than you.

304
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,200
Give him back.

305
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,067
What?

306
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,300
<i>She's serious.</i>

307
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,367
If I didn't go to America...

308
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,367
he would have never married you.

309
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,100
How would you know?

310
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,100
Because... Naoki was in love with me.

311
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,533
We exchanged passionate kisses.

312
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,800
He held me tight.

313
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,500
It was so romantic.

314
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,033
So what?
I don't know how Naoki felt then...

315
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,233
because all I could do
was watch him from afar.

316
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:58,233
But... little by little, he noticed me,
and he asked me to marry him!

317
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,433
Little by little?
You forced yourself on him!

318
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,533
No, I didn't!

319
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,067
What is this?

320
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,033
Who do you think you are? How stupid!

321
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,300
Give it back! Give it back!

322
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,200
You're in your own little world.
It's so stupid!

323
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:28,933
That's enough!

324
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,733
Rika!

325
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:33,700
Naoki!

326
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,600
It hurts.

327
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,067
Let me see your leg.

328
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,900
Naoki... I didn't mean to...

329
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:54,233
You should know better!
She's just a high-school kid!

330
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,967
What's wrong with you?

331
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:57,700
Can you stand?

332
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,567
I'll bandage it at home.

333
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,067
It wasn't like that.

334
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,433
<i>Naoki carried Rika away. Far, far away.</i>

335
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Kotoko?

336
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,900
We brought home your drunk daughter.

337
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,433
Oh, you're Kotoko's friends.

338
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,000
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

339
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,367
Excuse us.

340
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:13,433
She said she couldn't go home
after what she did to Rika.

341
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,400
She's been crying since this morning.

342
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,933
We went drinking to cheer her up.

343
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,900
I can't drink any more.

344
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,433
Get off of me. You're heavy.

345
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,767
What the hell?

346
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:30,767
Naoki!

347
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,567
Sorry to trouble you, Kikyo.

348
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:34,500
Don't mention it.

349
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,267
He called me by my name!

350
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
Come on. Let's go.

351
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,967
No!

352
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,733
You... You...

353
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:51,467
You don't like me anymore.

354
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,700
I'm an immature, violent girl.

355
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,400
Your eyes are telling me you're disgusted!

356
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
You're absolutely right!

357
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:05,500
I'm totally disgusted.

358
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,433
Let me down!

359
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,233
Let me down!

360
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,367
Be quiet!

361
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,400
But, Naoki, you like...

362
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,900
You like Rika more...

363
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,833
Rika... Rika more than me.

364
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,633
You...

365
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,667
Is Kotoko sleeping?

366
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,967
Sorry about this morning.

367
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,567
I don't want your apology.

368
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,200
You...

369
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,033
shouldn't provoke her like that.

370
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,600
-What? I never--
-Good night.

371
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,967
It's ready! Hurry, before it's burnt!

372
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,067
Eat up!

373
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,000
Naoki, I picked out the good ones.

374
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:22,567
Thank you.

375
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,600
Is it good?

376
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,633
Yeah, it's good.

377
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,867
Everything tastes good outdoors.

378
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,900
Don't eat too much, now.

379
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,267
Don't worry!

380
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,400
Kotoko, can you bring me a beer?

381
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:46,567
Yes.

382
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:48,967
I'll go with you.

383
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,533
Kotoko.

384
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,067
When did you fall in love with Naoki?

385
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,633
In my freshman year in high school.
So, 8 years ago.

386
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,867
That's pretty long.

387
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:30,200
But I've loved him since I was 2.
So, 15 years.

388
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,100
Rika...

389
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:45,300
you asked... for Naoki back.

390
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,933
Where's the beer?

391
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,600
Oh, no.

392
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,600
But... I can't do that.

393
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,533
Never.

394
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,000
I see.

395
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,833
But that's just your opinion.

396
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,300
I wonder how Naoki feels.

397
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,233
What if Naoki says he prefers me?

398
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,833
Then give him back to me, okay?

399
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,900
Fine. Ask him, then.

400
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:34,700
I see.

401
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,167
Did you hear that, Naoki?

402
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:42,967
Most of it.

403
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,467
I've always loved you.

404
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:57,067
I don't understand why you love Kotoko.

405
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,700
I'm a better match for you.

406
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:02,500
So, why did you marry Kotoko?

407
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Do you know how shocked
I was when I heard?

408
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,933
Then...

409
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:16,633
Then... you shouldn't have gone
to America!

410
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,233
How can you be apart so long
from the one you love?

411
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,667
It couldn't be helped!

412
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,433
I was in fifth grade.
I had to go with my parents.

413
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,733
It doesn't matter!

414
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,100
I could never stay away
from the one I loved.

415
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:34,167
If it were me...
I wouldn't have gone to America!

416
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:36,500
If it were me...

417
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:42,233
I'd stay near him,
even if he didn't love me!

418
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:47,867
You may have loved him longer than me...

419
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:53,000
but you'll never love him as much as I do!

420
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:00,333
So...

421
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,800
I don't know how Naoki feels...

422
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:09,233
but that's how I feel.

423
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:11,900
So...

424
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:14,333
Kotoko!

425
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,233
That's why.

426
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,900
That's why... I fell in love with her.

427
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,267
Unlike you... she can't do anything right.

428
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:39,033
But I love her power.

429
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,000
More than me?

430
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,200
More than you.

431
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,167
I see.

432
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,133
Maybe Kotoko...

433
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,333
wouldn't have gone to America.

434
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,400
Probably not.

435
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,133
Look at your face.

436
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,367
Why are you crying?

437
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,267
Because... what if...

438
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:53,267
it's over between us?

439
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,667
I have to find the strength
to go on living.

440
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:02,633
Go on living.

441
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,433
Can you?

442
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,533
No.

443
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:42,667
When did I ever give you reason
to doubt me?

444
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,233
I never have.

445
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,333
I chose you. Have more confidence.

446
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:28,800
Rika.

447
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:35,167
Naoki didn't like Kotoko at first.

448
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:40,967
She turned this house upside down.

449
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:44,967
But...

450
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:48,533
before he knew it, he fell in love.

451
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,300
Traitor.

452
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,867
Traitor!

453
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,567
You promised me...

454
00:37:57,633 --> 00:38:00,233
that you'd help me become your sister.

455
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:03,067
That you'd help me get married to Naoki.

456
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:06,600
It's all your fault!

457
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:10,733
Stupid Yuki!

458
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,533
Stupid! Stupid!

459
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,233
Sorry.

460
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:25,567
Sorry...

461
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,067
Rika.

462
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Uncle, aunty...

463
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,700
thank you for having me.

464
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,367
We'll miss you.

465
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,967
We felt like we had two daughters.

466
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,467
-Come back anytime.
-Of course.

467
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:54,800
Next time I'll bring a boyfriend
that's better looking than Naoki.

468
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,400
Good luck finding one.

469
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,967
Oh, you two.

470
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,267
Rika.

471
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,267
See you.

472
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,933
This kind of reminds me
of that other time.

473
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:20,500
Other time?

474
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,100
The day I left for America.

475
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:27,067
The day we had our first kiss.

476
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,233
So, it was a goodbye kiss.

477
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,400
Should I do it again to show you?

478
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,500
No! No! No!

479
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,733
That's what happened seven years ago.

480
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:54,733
Sorry. I may have dramatized a bit.

481
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,733
Dramatized?

482
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,767
Actually, I forced myself on him.

483
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,867
But it was still a kiss.

484
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,300
So, that's how it was.

485
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:18,967
Here.

486
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,300
For me?

487
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:29,733
I guess I'll have to accept you
as Naoki's wife.

488
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,167
See you!

489
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,600
-Take care.
-See you.

490
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:38,867
-See you.
-Bye-bye.

491
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,133
See you, Rika!

492
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,800
Bye-bye!

493
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,433
She's so loud.

494
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,800
Bye-bye, Naoki.

495
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:20,033
<i>I'm the person who understands</i>
<i>Rika's feelings the most.</i>

496
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,433
<i>The next time we meet...</i>

497
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,767
<i>I'm sure we can be better friends.</i>

498
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:26,967
<i>Right, Rika?</i>

499
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,200
NEXT EPISODE:
NAOKI, COUNTING ON YOU FOR KOTOKO!

500
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:59,033
You like Yuki, don't you?

501
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,600
His cool eyes.

502
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,133
I'm rooting for you!

503
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:06,000
Next week is the anniversary of
Kotoko's mother's death. I'll go with you.

504
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:07,833
You don't have to!

505
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,433
-Are you hiding something?
-You'll see soon enough.

506
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,433
Thank you for this unbelievable reception.

507
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,067
{\an8}But my name is misspelled.

508
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,033
{\an8}The characters are wrong.

509
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,533

MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2
