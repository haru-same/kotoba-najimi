1
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,200
Excuse me, madam.

2
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:28,833
Madam.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,467
Something to drink?

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,533
Oh, yes.

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,433
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Excuse me.

6
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,733
We have coffee, Japanese tea,
and orange juice.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,633
Then, coffee...

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,700
Coffee please!

9
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,367
Certainly, madam.

10
00:00:58,567 --> 00:00:59,567
Here you are.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,700
Why are you speaking English?

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,133
Oh, dear, I didn't know you're awake.

13
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:20,233
We're going to Okinawa,
You don't need English.

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,233
'Cause this is my first time flying.

15
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:28,700
When it comes to flights,
it's "Attention, please! Coffee or tea?"

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,133
You're carried away.

17
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:36,933
Of course I am. It's our honeymoon!

18
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:44,033
<i>Yes, we're on our honeymoon...</i>

19
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,533
<i>to Okinawa!</i>

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,100
<i>And sitting here next to me...</i>

21
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:53,300
<i>I have dreamed of having</i>
<i>for a long time... Irie-kun!</i>

22
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,400
What?

23
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,600
We really are married now.

24
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,467
I just realized it.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,567
How many times you have
to look at those pictures?

26
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,967
I'm gonna take a nap.

27
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,200
Are you sleeping?
It's our honeymoon.

28
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,600
My mom's set up our wedding and
this honeymoon without asking me.

29
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,433
I'm tired.

30
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,867
Are you on honeymoon?

31
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,100
<i>The girl who laughed at me earlier.</i>

32
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,567
-Yes.
-So are we! Right?

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,233
Hi.

34
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,167
Oh, did your husband fall asleep?

35
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:47,667
Poor you, it's your
long-awaited honeymoon.

36
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,900
I'd never fall asleep
and leave Mari alone.

37
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,967
You have such a sweet husband.

38
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:59,300
'Cause Takumi is madly in love with me.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
Madly in love...

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,333
The day Mari joined our company,
I felt, "She is it!"

41
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,767
A boring office romance.

42
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,400
What do you mean "boring?"

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,400
And... you are?

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,367
I'm, Kotoko. Iri...

45
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,667
I'm Kotoko Irie.

46
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:23,667
-Your husband proposed to you?
-No! Never! No way!

47
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:24,900
What?

48
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:27,400
For us, I'd say...

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,267
I was the one who tried
to hit him like crazy.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,300
TONAN HIGH SCHOOL
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

51
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,667
<i>It was love at first sight</i>
<i>all the way back</i>

52
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,633
<i>to the Entrance ceremony.</i>

53
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,533
I love you.

54
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:47,900
I don't want it.

55
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,767
Please take it as your home.

56
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:59,133
I'm the eldest son, Naoki.
Nice to meet you.

57
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,033
Will you keep distance from me?

58
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,133
I hate stupid girls.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,433
Kotoko.

60
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,733
What?

61
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:13,533
"You may not know me, but I know you."

62
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:17,567
"I was attracted by you giving a speech
at the entrance ceremony."

63
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,300
I'll...

64
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,233
I'll stop loving you.

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,200
I'll see if you can do that.

66
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,100
Serves you right.

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,500
Yuki! Yuki! Hold on!

68
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,500
Papa! Are you all right!?

69
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,567
I'll protect my dad's company.

70
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,900
This is Mr. Oizumi,
the chairman of Hokueisha.

71
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,167
How about having
a marriage interview?

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,500
I'll snatch Kotoko away from you.

73
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,833
I'll let you forget that bastard.

74
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,733
No! Stop! Irie-kun!

75
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,367
You love me!

76
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,200
You'll never love anyone but me.

77
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,300
How could you be so confident!?

78
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,867
Yeah, you're right! I can't help it!

79
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:41,467
But you don't even love me!
You don't even...

80
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,200
I love you so much.

81
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,367
Serves you right.

82
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,733
So...

83
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,433
My 6 year-long one-sided love
finally ended up with our marriage

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,400
and here we are.

85
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,567
You were quite patient, Kotoko.

86
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,633
Oh, my, what am I...

87
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,433
So you came from behind to win.

88
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,067
Yeah, maybe.

89
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,967
So you pushed him down
into the bed? Right on!

90
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:34,533
No way! We are yet to go
that far...that far...

91
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:39,667
<i>He went to bed first last night</i>
<i>saying he's tired...</i>

92
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,567
Wait, so you mean...

93
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,900
You're kidding!
You haven't slept with him yet?

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,300
I haven't seen a couple
like you guys before.

95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,800
But... aren't you anxious?

96
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,233
What?

97
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,100
I would be shocked if my partner
wouldn't want me as a woman.

98
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,467
I'd come to think I'm not
attractive to my partner.

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,533
Well...

100
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,867
Are you guys okay? Please don't
end up being "Narita divorced."

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,133
It's not Narita. It's Haneda. My bad!

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,133
Narita... divorce...!?

103
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:30,500
I feel I'm a bit tired.
Takumi, give me a massage.

104
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,867
Yes, I'm willing to!

105
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,367
<i>Na... Narita divorce...!?</i>

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,233
<i>How dare she says that to me</i>
<i>on my first day of honeymoon!</i>

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,567
MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,467
{\an8}What's up?

109
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,100
{\an8}My sunglasses.

110
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,533
{\an8}LOVE IN OKINAWA

111
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,933
{\an8}Sunglasses?
I thought you're night-blind.

112
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,000
{\an8}Night-blind people feel brightness to.

113
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,500
Let's see...

114
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,500
Wait till we get to the hotel.

115
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,167
I wanna wear them right now.

116
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,633
It doesn't open.

117
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,767
Yeah, right.

118
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,433
Gosh, maybe the lock is broken?

119
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
You don't wanna break that.

120
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:18,667
It's open, Irie-kun!

121
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,867
You wear that?

122
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,433
No! I never wear
this kind of swimsuit!

123
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,667
I wonder who would wear
this kind of showy stuff.

124
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,400
That's mine!

125
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,767
Is that... mine?

126
00:10:56,733 --> 00:11:00,333
I'm so glad that we're staying
at the same hotel!

127
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:06,667
<i>Why in the world do we have to stay</i>
<i>at the same hotel with this slut!?</i>

128
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,167
Hey, why don't we have
some food together after this?

129
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,600
Irie-kun! Let's go to our room!

130
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,833
Excuse us, please.

131
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,000
So finally, we're just two of us.

132
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,333
Watch out!

133
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm sorry! Are you all right?
Got hurt?

134
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm fine.

135
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,067
Go... Minam?

136
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,367
Are you Go Mi Nam of the A. N. JELL?

137
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,467
Kang Shin-woo... Jeremy...?!

138
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,100
Yap, we are.

139
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,200
-I'm Go Mi Nam.
-Kang Shin-woo.

140
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,233
Jeremy.

141
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,567
Oh my gosh! It's A. N. JELL!

142
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:59,100
Popular band from Taiwan!

143
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,100
From Taiwan?

144
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,567
I'm a big fan of them!

145
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,833
{\an8}Sorry for the trouble.

146
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,000
{\an8}We're okay because
you stopped this quickly.

147
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,200
Please ask them why they're in Okinawa.

148
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,333
You do it.

149
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,967
But, I don't speak their language.

150
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,400
Come on.

151
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,600
{\an8}Why are you guys in Okinawa?

152
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,400
{\an8}To shoot a music video.

153
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,533
Okinawa is awesome!

154
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,500
What? What did they say?

155
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,533
They're here to shoot a music video.

156
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,533
Really! That's so cool!

157
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,067
Have a nice trip.

158
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,233
Bye-bye.

159
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:40,700
Best wishes.

160
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,500
Wow, thank you!

161
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:45,333
Bye-bye!

162
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,933
-Let's go.
-Gotcha!

163
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,933
Fantastic! How fantastic!

164
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:07,800
White beach and blue sky!

165
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,667
Okinawa! We're in Okinawa, Irie-kun!

166
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,633
Calm down.

167
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,600
What a gorgeous bed!

168
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:30,433
I can roll over and over!
Hey, look, Irie-kun!

169
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,867
<i>Wait. Tonight I will be in this bed...</i>

170
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,867
<i>with Irie-kun...</i>

171
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:46,333
<i>I will be unified in love with Irie-kun.</i>

172
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,733
Irie-kun...

173
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:58,800
Yeah?

174
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:06,033
I'll do my best to become
a good wife, so...

175
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,333
So, please don't give up on me.

176
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,833
You were caught up with
A. N. JELL a few minutes ago.

177
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,267
What?

178
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,033
Nothing.

179
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:29,700
I don't expect you much.
Just stay as you are.

180
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,533
Stay who you are.

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,867
Hello?

182
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:10,833
<i>Hello? Naoki? It's me! Mari!</i>

183
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:15,533
Naoki, Naoki! Kotoko!
Over here!

184
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,800
We kept seats for you!

185
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,833
<i>How dare she repeats</i>
<i>his name like she's dating!</i>

186
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:25,500
Naoki! Right here!
We got seats for you guys!

187
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,467
Hi.

188
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:30,100
We can drink here at the pool!

189
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
Naoki, let's go to order!

190
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,500
-Okay, then let me...
-Sure.

191
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,600
Please excuse her,
I guess she likes Naoki.

192
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,433
Hey Takumi! ...is it right?

193
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:53,567
What kind of disciplines
are you giving to your wife!?

194
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:59,267
If you know what's going on,
stop her! Aren't you her husband?

195
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:03,367
Yeah, but my love was one-sided
for a long time,

196
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,433
I barely got to her heart.

197
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:10,033
Why are you being so nervous!
You guys are married you forget?!

198
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,700
It's vice versa!

199
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,467
Stupid Kotoko,
it's funny you say that.

200
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:25,167
<i>I think I just heard</i>
<i>a voice sounds like Yuki.</i>

201
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,700
I guess those two get along well.

202
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,767
Maybe, we should make out, too!

203
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:39,233
She is clinging on Irie-kun!

204
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Are you all right?

205
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,867
I will bring you a towel immediately.

206
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,533
What the heck!?

207
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,733
Hey, watch out!

208
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,600
Good work! Ms. Blond!

209
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,300
Mari, are you okay?

210
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,067
Are you okay, Mari?

211
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,633
Damn!

212
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,633
It was my mistake.

213
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,400
Wait a minute, those people...

214
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,433
...are from a foreign country!

215
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,267
Wow, so Naoki is a future doctor?

216
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,567
No, I'm just aspiring to be a doctor.

217
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,367
But you're aspiring, that's awesome.

218
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm quite sure Irie-kun will soon
get into some medical school!

219
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,433
'Cause, no matter what,
he got 200 on IQ test!

220
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:59,567
I heard you two got married after
Kotoko's impetuous approach.

221
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,367
Impetuous...

222
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,233
Yeah, because Irie-kun is like one
who lives in another world.

223
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:13,000
You two are married, and
you still call him "Irie-kun."

224
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:16,333
-So you're still not that close to him.
-Mari!

225
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,167
Well, I've been used to this way
for years!

226
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:28,200
Just that much of drink.

227
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,833
Kotoko, we're back in our room.

228
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,733
Hey, Kotoko.

229
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,333
Honey, we're back in our room.

230
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:15,967
Can't help it...

231
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,500
Irie-kun...

232
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,400
I love you...

233
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,800
DAY 2

234
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,300
It's Shisa! So cute!

235
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,500
-Let's take a picture with this!!
-No way.

236
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
Let's ask somebody
to take a picture!

237
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,067
Let's see...

238
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,767
Excuse me, could you take
a picture of us?

239
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,367
Thank you! I beg your kindness!

240
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,133
Irie-kun!

241
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,000
Get more closer to each other!

242
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,100
Say, "Chinsuko!"

243
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,600
-Thank you very much!
-Okay?

244
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,133
Yes, this is great! Thank you!

245
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,467
I've seen those guys...

246
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,667
Oh, at the swimming pool!

247
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:55,567
They were at the swimming pool
yesterday! What a coincidence!

248
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:59,567
No wonder! This spot was
recommended on a guide book!

249
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:04,233
It was so much fun! I'm starving.

250
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,300
Let's eat!

251
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,067
Oh, what a coincidence!

252
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:14,300
Can we have lunch with you?
Excuse me!

253
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,900
-Having a good time today?
-We just saw the Eisa show.

254
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,567
Cool! We'll go see it after this!
Excited, Takumi?

255
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,233
Did you enjoy it?

256
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,433
Yes, we did!

257
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,367
Say, "Cheese!"

258
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,700
DAY 3

259
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:50,200
Wow! How colorful these fishes are!

260
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:54,667
Irie-kun, a coconut crab!
Do you think this tastes good?

261
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,067
Excuse me! Can I have this?

262
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,200
Let me take you to the second floor.

263
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,767
Naoki! This way!

264
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,867
Hurry, we got seats for you!

265
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,933
Hurry, Naoki!

266
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,233
DAY 4

267
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,733
Naoki!

268
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:27,467
Hurry, Naoki! This way!

269
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Can you see me? Hurry up!
I'm waiting for you!

270
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,733
Naoki!

271
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:40,500
<i>Why the heck does</i>
<i>she always gets in the way?!</i>

272
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,467
DAY 5

273
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:51,733
Voila! This is the main-temple,
a Ryukyuan castle long ago.

274
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:55,300
1, 2, 3... 3 dragons!
I wonder why it's not Shisa!

275
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,967
A bright red castle!

276
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,733
Naoki, what's your favorite color?

277
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:05,233
DAY 6

278
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,500
Oh, my gosh...

279
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,600
Why didn't I notice...?

280
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,267
Today's our last day in Okinawa!

281
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,867
It's the last chance tonight.

282
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,567
We're heading back
to Tokyo tomorrow.

283
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,967
But, we haven't had any progress
in our relationship.

284
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:43,033
It's all because that couple
bothers us every day.

285
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,767
They invite us for some a drink
every night.

286
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,700
Same as mine.

287
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,367
So we got married around
the same time.

288
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,133
You have two lines of fate!

289
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,567
Another round!

290
00:23:56,233 --> 00:24:01,033
I know I'm carelessly drinking
over my capacity.

291
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,200
<i>Thanks to all that, we're still</i>
<i>far away from romance.</i>

292
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:13,267
Please don't end up being
"Narita divorced."

293
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:21,367
What if we'll end it up with nothing?!

294
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:27,100
My dear Kotoko! I expect you a lot!

295
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,233
For mom's sake, and for my sake!

296
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,700
I'll never go back to Tokyo
without any progress!

297
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,867
Tonight!

298
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:45,233
We will definitely have
a true bridal night!

299
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,933
Wow, it's a whale shark! So huge!

300
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
<i>Tonight, I will definitely...</i>

301
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:22,633
Look, Irie-kun!
What a beautiful chapel!

302
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,533
Good smile both of you!
Okay, are you ready?

303
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,367
Say, "Cheese!"

304
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:36,033
Okay, let's take another one.
Looks good! Say, "Cheese!"

305
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,133
And another one. Say, "Cheese!"

306
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,900
Now, sir, please put your hand
gently on your wife's shoulder.

307
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,467
Looks great! Good smile, madam!

308
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:52,900
Sir, give me a smile! Smile, please!
Say, "Cheese!"

309
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:59,900
Lucky us, we could have
our photo without reservation.

310
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:03,600
It reminds me of
our wedding ceremony!

311
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:06,933
I'm never gonna do this again.

312
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,867
Thank you so much.

313
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:13,933
No problem. We were expecting
another couple for a photoshoot so.

314
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,867
A couple...?

315
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,433
I guess they're here!

316
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,533
This way, please.

317
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,933
You two were here?

318
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,067
We met again.

319
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,000
You know each other?

320
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:33,933
Yes.

321
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:36,000
Naoki you look so cool!

322
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:41,300
I bet it's 'cause you're tall!
Don't we look like a perfect match?

323
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,200
How about taking pictures
of Naoki and me?

324
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,300
No, I think not.

325
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:49,500
Kotoko, I'd lend you Takumi.
What do you think, Naoki?

326
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,567
Sorry, we need to go now.

327
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,967
Souvenirs, right?

328
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,200
Y... yes.

329
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,300
Let's go, Kotoko.

330
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,333
Yes.

331
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,933
Wait for me, Irie-kun!

332
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,700
What happened?

333
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,867
Please help Mari.

334
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,300
She said her stomach
has suddenly hurt.

335
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,033
Why don't you take her to hospital?

336
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,733
It's weekend,
and probably it's too late.

337
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,433
Then, call an ambulance!

338
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,600
She doesn't wanna make this serious.

339
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,800
It'll get better if I keep lying down.
Oh, it hurts!

340
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:01,767
Mari! Are you okay? Are you okay?

341
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:06,933
Naoki!
You said you wanna be a doctor, right?

342
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,433
Could you take a look?

343
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,200
No way! Though he aspires
to be a doctor, he is still...

344
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:14,767
Okay. I'll take a look.

345
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,267
-Does she have nausea?
-No.

346
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,100
-Fever?
-Not particularly.

347
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,800
Let me check your pulse.

348
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,833
Naoki, is Mari going to be okay?

349
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:35,733
Where does it hurt?
Let me see your stomach.

350
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:46,067
<i>No, Irie-kun! Don't touch her!</i>

351
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:49,933
Hey, I think we should call
an ambulance.

352
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,400
It depends on her condition.

353
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,667
Then, what about our dinner?

354
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,233
This is not the time for that!

355
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,000
No! Don't touch her, Irie-kun!

356
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,900
Don't touch another girl!

357
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,433
That's enough!

358
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,833
You married a guy
who's gonna be a doctor!

359
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,133
You better be aware of that.

360
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,833
Irie-kun.

361
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,967
Are you always gonna be that way
when I see patients?

362
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,733
I don't wanna deal with that.

363
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,433
If you don't understand,
I can't be with you anymore.

364
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,333
Naoki, you're going too far...

365
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:48,300
Kotoko!

366
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,033
You don't have to go after your wife?

367
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:57,233
Your wife's all right.
I assume she's got mild food poisoning.

368
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:03,267
Pharmacy is still open,
some stomach medicine will do it.

369
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:04,800
Thank you so much.

370
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,600
Takumi, go buy it for me.

371
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,533
Yeah, sure. I'll be back soon.

372
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,833
-You should go find your wife.
-Takumi, hurry up!

373
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,300
Yes, then...

374
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,700
So, I'm off.

375
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,133
Naoki, you have a cold heart.

376
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,767
Because you have your partner...Kotoko.

377
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,167
Or you don't love her...?

378
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,133
Don't you have a stomachache?

379
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,800
I made it up.

380
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,200
What?

381
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:42,400
'Cause I wanted to be alone
with you, Naoki.

382
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:46,667
I heard you guys haven't done
anything sexual yet.

383
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,767
Well, it's understandable.

384
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:52,800
You don't feel like it with Kotoko, right?

385
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,500
I fell in love with you
at the first sight.

386
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:01,267
I wish I had met you before she did.

387
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:05,000
Then, both of us didn't have
to marry a wrong partner.

388
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,767
It's not too late.

389
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,367
Shut up.

390
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,833
What?

391
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:19,433
Even if I'd encounter you 100 times,
I would ignore you every time!

392
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,367
What...

393
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,933
Do not compare yourself with Kotoko.

394
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,100
Oh, my, I forgot my wallet.

395
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,000
What happened, Mari?

396
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:39,567
Naoki seemed angry.

397
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,800
I'm not gonna forgive him.

398
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,433
He fooled me.

399
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,633
Mari?

400
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,500
I'll definitely break them up!

401
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,067
He didn't have to be that mean!

402
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,433
-Don't you dare!
-That's my word for it!

403
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,767
How dare you do that to me!
We're finished! We're over!

404
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:05,833
You're right!

405
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,800
We started off by my one-sided love!

406
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:12,800
But, now we're married,
we're together in the same place!

407
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,000
You're my wife!
Don't give your heart to the other guy!

408
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:20,133
Did you get it?

409
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,000
Yes.

410
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
<i>I'm so terrible...</i>

411
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,333
<i>I feel so embarrassed,</i>
<i>I wanna kill myself.</i>

412
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,333
<i>Thought I understood Irie-kun's</i>
<i>ambition to become a doctor.</i>

413
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,767
Where am I?

414
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,933
<i>I guess I'm totally lost.</i>

415
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,767
<i>I don't remember how</i>
<i>and where I came in from.</i>

416
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,633
<i>I left my wallet at hotel.</i>

417
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:16,900
<i>Feels like I strayed</i>
<i>into a savage place</i>

418
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:30,733
<i>I'm gonna be kidnapped!</i>

419
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:37,100
<i>If I get kidnapped, maybe</i>
<i>I could never go back to Irie-kun!</i>

420
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,167
<i>Irie-kun, help me!</i>

421
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:44,133
Irie-kun!

422
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,400
Irie-kun, I love you!

423
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:53,667
Narita divorce!! No!!

424
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,533
What is she doing?

425
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:11,333
Irie-kun!

426
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,467
I thought I will never see you again!

427
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:24,700
I thought you will never find me.

428
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,333
Everything is okay.

429
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:35,467
He thought you were a lost
elementary school student.

430
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,000
An elementary school student?

431
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,100
So, he is not a bad guy?

432
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,767
Anyway, apologize.

433
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Thanks for coming.

434
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,200
Your scream was real loud.

435
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,567
'Cause...

436
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:26,600
Narita divorce... how classic.

437
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,933
or we say, Haneda divorce, right?

438
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:38,867
I'm sorry.

439
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,233
I was jealous.

440
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,267
Having being selfish,
I was such a scumbag.

441
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,967
You fool, I really worried about you.

442
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,700
Splendid!

443
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:11,400
I was right buying this
high-sensitive camera.

444
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:26,933
<i>What a feeling of this chaotic</i>
<i>anger swirling inside of me...</i>

445
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:33,367
<i>was turning into something</i>
<i>warm and sweet like a candy.</i>

446
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,800
It took so long to get here.

447
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:50,033
Yeah, but I was okay.

448
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:53,733
I was happy just staying
by your side.

449
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,733
I'm not okay.

450
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:43,500
<i>If there was a way to measure</i>
<i>my happiness...</i>

451
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:54,067
<i>I must've been the happiest one</i>
<i>of all in this world today.</i>

452
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:57,500
<i>I'll never forget</i>
<i>what happened today.</i>

453
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,367
<i>Never.</i>

454
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:24,700
Time flies in the blink of an eye...

455
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm so sad. I already miss there.

456
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:32,233
We couldn't spend much time
alone together.

457
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,233
It tastes good!

458
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,333
Really?

459
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,167
Mari, your turn.

460
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
What happened to those two?

461
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,333
They are the ones
who put us in trouble!

462
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,733
It's good for them.

463
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,633
Well, you're right. But...

464
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,700
What?

465
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,367
Nothing.

466
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:17,133
<i>Our stay was short,</i>
<i>but it brought us sweet memories.</i>

467
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,067
<i>Sorry for making you wait, Noriko.</i>

468
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:24,467
<i>Irie-kun and I finally</i>
<i>met your expectations.</i>

469
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,467
-It's sweet.
-Tastes good.

470
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,033
That was fun!

471
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,967
Let's go again someday.

472
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,300
Yeah, someday.

473
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,400
Next time, we'll be all alone and...

474
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,400
Naoki-san!

475
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,167
Mr. Kanamori...

476
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,600
Welcome home, Mr. Irie.

477
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,467
And Mrs. Irie.

478
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,633
Mrs. Irie...!

479
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:19,433
What are you doing here?

480
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:22,567
I came to fetch you.

481
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,033
Fetch us?

482
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:34,933
What is it? Did something happen
at work while my dad was away?

483
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,867
Your father was away?

484
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,533
It's not for me to say.

485
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,200
Aren't we going home?

486
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:52,433
Where are we headed, Mr. Kanamori?

487
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,100
We'll be there shortly.

488
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:58,933
Shortly?

489

<i>You're not officially married?!</i>

491
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:01,633
I'm not ready to register our marriage.

492
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,667
I don't understand Naoki at all.

493
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:05,633
It's fine.

494
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,267
There must be some reason.

495
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,633
Tennis warrior Koto-rin!

496
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:12,533
What a useless bride.

497
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,067
Don't play with her heart!

498
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,033
What are you men thinking?

499
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:19,300
<i>I don't want to see him.</i>

500
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,267
This isn't a marriage!

501
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,400
