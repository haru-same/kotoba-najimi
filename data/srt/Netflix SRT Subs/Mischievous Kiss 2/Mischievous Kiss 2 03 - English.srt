1
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,733
I'd like to introduce my wife,
Kotoko Irie.

2
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:26,067
MARRIAGE LICENSE APPLICATION

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,567
Oh!

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,900
Now it's your turn.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,967
Okay!

6
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,400
Now, you're my wife.

7
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,300
{\an8}It's our last semester
as college students.

8
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,267
{\an8}9 MONTHS LATER

9
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,300
{\an8}It's kind of sad.

10
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:04,167
I won't be at school
that much this term.

11
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,633
I'm pretty busy, too.

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,933
I work at a fashion magazine,
but all I do is run errands.

13
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:12,500
Our editorial department is

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,733
preparing for its year-end show.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,533
I wish I could relish
the last few months of student life.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,900
Both of you are so busy
with your internships.

17
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,533
I guess we won't see
too much of each other.

18
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:31,367
We have job offers,
but we're still on probation.

19
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,933
But not you, Kotoko.

20
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,900
Your husband will be a doctor
with lifetime employment!

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,467
-What a catch!
-So lucky!

22
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,700
Yeah...

23
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:51,700
Tonan University.

24
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:48,600
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

25
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,033
{\an8}HELLO BABY?!

26
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,567
Is this right?

27
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:04,467
Shouldn't I be looking for a job?

28
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,867
What do I want to do?

29
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,567
Excuse me.

30
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:38,067
I don't understand English. I'm sorry.

31
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,100
Oh, no!

32
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
You're welcome. I'm sorry.

33
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,133
Oh, I'm sorry, too.

34
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:50,533
By the way, hello.
What is the Literature Department?

35
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,633
I wonder.

36
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,967
Oh, I made a mistake.

37
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,667
"Where" is the Literature Department?

38
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,100
Oh! Where!

39
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,933
I'm going there, too.
Together please, we go.

40
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,233
Oh, okay! Thank you!

41
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,700
<i>She understood me!</i>

42
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,033
My name is Christine Robbins.

43
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,500
I went from England.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,133
No, came! I came from England.
I'm 19 years old.

45
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,900
Please call me Chris. Okay?

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,300
Oh, okay! Chris!

47
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,167
I came to Tonan University

48
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,567
to study for six months.

49
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:46,633
I'm here!

50
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,833
My name is Kotoko Irie.

51
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,533
I'm 21 years old.

52
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,067
Kotoko! Okay. Nice to meet you, Kotoko!

53
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,367
Same here!

54
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,100
TONAN UNIVERSITY
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT

55
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,933
Oh! Your darling is a doctor?

56
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,933
A fledgling doctor.

57
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,200
I wonder where he is.

58
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,433
Oh, well. I'll ask.

59
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,700
Excuse me.

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,633
Yes?

61
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,800
Do you know Irie, a senior here?

62
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,300
Irie? Naoki Irie?

63
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,033
Yes! The genius!

64
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,067
<i>I knew it! He's famous.</i>

65
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,133
And you are...?

66
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,200
His friend. Or should I say, his wife!

67
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:41,767
<i>There! I said it!</i>

68
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:49,867
You...?

69
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,733
Is something wrong?

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,567
I was curious to see what kind of girl
captured Irie's heart.

71
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,433
You're not exactly what I imagined.

72
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:06,600
<i>What kind of chuckle was that?</i>
<i>Like something's stuck in his teeth.</i>

73
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,600
<i>How rude.</i>

74
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
Kotoko?

75
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,300
Chris!

76
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,067
Is she an exchange student?

77
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,100
Oh, yes.

78
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,500
{\an8}Hi, I'm Seiichi Funatsu.

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,667
{\an8}I'm a medical student.

80
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,567
{\an8}I'm one of the top students here.

81
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:32,267
{\an8}If you don't mind, I'll show you around.

82
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:37,667
{\an8}I would like to see
if my English skills are world class.

83
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:43,533
Thank you, but I'll pass.

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You're not my type.

85
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,000
My standards are high.

86
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,967
You're not even close!

87
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,367
For that reason, I'll pass.

88
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,000
Not even close?

89
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,633
<i>That bad?</i>

90
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,400
<i>Your standards are high.</i>

91
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,467
What are you doing here, Kotoko?

92
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,967
Naoki!

93
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,267
What do you want?

94
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:15,733
Oh, yeah!

95
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:20,133
This is my classmate Chris.
She's an exchange student.

96
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,333
Chris, this is my husband, Naoki.

97
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,233
How do you do, Chris?

98
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:34,067
We were talking about going
to my dad's restaurant tonight.

99
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:37,600
Do you want to join us?

100
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,900
Is it okay if I join you?

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,733
<i>What's wrong, Chris?</i>

102
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,400
Shall I translate?

103
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,067
{\an8}Is it okay if I join you, as well?

104
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,100
Oh!

105
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,533
Please do! Yeah! I'll eat you up.

106
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,200
Chris.

107
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:11,433
<i>Is Naoki Chris' ideal boyfriend?</i>

108
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,833
Maybe you should focus
on studying instead of playing.

109
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,100
I appreciate your concern.

110
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,967
But going out won't affect my grades.

111
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:26,667
You can rest assured in your 2 spot.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,900
Wh--? What?

113
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,833
You won't be resting
on your laurels for long!

114
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:38,133
I'll beat you at the upcoming
dissertation presentation

115
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,467
and go to the conference!

116
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,833
Who's that?

117
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,467
Funatsu.

118
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,300
Never mind. Leave him alone.

119
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,100
I'll join you after I'm done.

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,333
Okay.

121
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,700
JAPANESE CUISINE
"AIHARA"

122
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,700
Looks delicious!

123
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Eat up. Don't hold back.

124
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,567
Thank you, Kotoko papa.

125
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,067
Naoki is joining us later.

126
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,300
Okay.

127
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,800
Delicious!

128
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,800
<i>Chris is adorable.</i>

129
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,300
<i>Sigh...</i>

130
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,333
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

131
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,800
I finished prepping
for the banquet, boss.

132
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,233
Okay.

133
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,900
Kotoko! I missed you!

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,133
Naoki!

135
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,033
-Welcome.
-There he is!

136
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,400
Good evening.

137
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,733
Shoot. Naoki's here too, huh?

138
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Hurry and break up. I beg of you.

139
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,233
Who's this blond?

140
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,167
<i>Chris, I thought you were...</i>

141
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,633
She's a quiet one.
Don't you speak Japanese?

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Hello. I love Kotoko.

143
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,000
Kin-chan. This is Chris.

144
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:25,267
She's studying at Tonan for six months.

145
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,533
Chris, this is Kinnosuke Ikezawa.
Call him Kin-chan.

146
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,333
He used to be my classmate
but now he's a fabulous chef.

147
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,500
What's wrong, Chris?

148
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,633
Kotoko, I have to be honest.

149
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,733
I found my true love.

150
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,333
I never felt this way before.

151
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,600
Kotoko, you may not like
what I'm going to say.

152
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>You mean...</i>

153
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,233
But please! Let me say it!

154
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,800
The man I love is...

155
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,933
No! Naoki is my husband!

156
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,033
Hey.

157
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,367
What?

158
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,300
No way.

159
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,933
Oh, Kinnosuke!

160
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,933
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,567
Oh, my love, are you okay?

162
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Thanks for helping us out, Naoki.

163
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,567
I hope I was of some help.

164
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,700
You saved the day.

165
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,800
That Kinnosuke. We're so busy

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,067
and he goes and faints.

167
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,733
He looks so happy.

168
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,833
Poor guy. It's my fault.

169
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,133
I can't believe he fainted from a kiss.

170
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,167
He looks so cute. Kinnosuke!

171
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,667
Do you really think so, Chris?

172
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,600
Of course! Is it a problem?

173
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,933
Oh, no! As long as it's
good for you, it's fine with me.

174
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,967
You're the problem, Kotoko.

175
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,900
I couldn't tell you
because you're my friend

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
but friends don't keep secrets
so I'll tell you.

177
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:31,467
You have bad taste in men.

178
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,667
I knew it when I saw Naoki.

179
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:38,667
You have no idea
what handsomeness means.

180
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,300
What? Are you kidding?

181
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,167
You're the one that has no idea!

182
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:51,633
Love is blind.
But I have perfect eyesight.

183
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:57,600
Kinnosuke is the best!
Kinnosuke wins the gold medal!

184
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,967
Kin-chan is so ugly!

185
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:04,067
Naoki is looking 100 times better!

186
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,267
That's because you have bad taste.

187
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,133
I think I'll get married to Kinnosuke.

188
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I've decided. It's definite!

189
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:15,333
You're the one that's blind!

190
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>I can't get up in the middle of this.</i>

191
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
A FEW WEEKS LATER

192
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,867
What?

193
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,200
You'll be gone for three days?

194
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:36,267
I'm going to a conference in Kobe.

195
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,933
What?

196
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:42,967
Does that mean your dissertation
was selected at the presentation?

197
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,667
-Yeah.
-Wow, that's great!

198
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:49,400
You're amazing, Naoki!

199
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,833
It's no big deal.

200
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,533
But it is! You're amazing.
You're on a different level.

201
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:01,767
Speaking of levels...
What about Funatsu?

202
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh, him.

203
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,167
I object!

204
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:11,633
Why wasn't I chosen?
This is a conspiracy!

205
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,467
My dissertation was clearly superior!

206
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,367
Naoki, you must agree with me.

207
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,967
My essay was superior.

208
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,300
Be a man and admit it!

209
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,967
Okay.

210
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,567
Right?

211
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,733
I understand.

212
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:33,933
You finally admit it?

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,467
You really love staying at <i>2.</i>

214
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,333
-Calm down!
-Irie!

215
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,133
Let go! Let go!

216
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,367
Irie! Let go!

217
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,500
-Don't touch me! Let go!
-Calm down!

218
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,800
Naoki is a genius.

219
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a shame.
He'd make a good surgeon.

220
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:06,333
Is Funatsu that capable?

221
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,267
No one can wield a scalpel like he can.

222
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,367
Not even you?

223
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,600
I wonder...

224
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,433
He's that good, huh?

225
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,333
If only his personality
wasn't so warped.

226
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:27,800
I'll be so lonely
without you for three days.

227
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,700
It's just you and me again.

228
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,800
-What's wrong?
-Well...

229
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,567
My stomach's been
feeling funny since lunch.

230
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,867
You probably pigged out again.

231
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:49,533
You always think the worst.

232
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,600
You have a slight fever.

233
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:56,400
Open your mouth.

234
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,200
Lie down and pull up your shirt.

235
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,633
Are we playing doctor?
Feeling sexy?

236
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,400
We're not playing anything.

237
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,100
Hurry up.

238
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,233
Okay.

239
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:31,733
You'll keep me company
while he's away.

240
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,167
"I'm here for you."

241
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,100
Okay! I'll stay with you.

242
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,500
Jinko! Satomi! You came to visit me?

243
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,600
What a gorgeous room.

244
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,167
-How are you feeling?
-I'm still a little nauseous.

245
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,433
Naoki is gone anyways,
so I'm taking it easy.

246
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm not surprised.

247
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,200
The way you attacked
that buffet yesterday?

248
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,500
Eight pieces of cake?

249
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:04,867
I didn't tell Naoki that part.

250
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,533
We brought fruits. Want some?

251
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,867
Thank you! I was craving
something refreshing!

252
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:17,067
-Is there grapefruit?
-Probably.

253
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,467
Did you just say grapefruit?

254
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,700
Yes.

255
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:32,333
You feel nauseous, right?
And you're craving something sour?

256
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,933
You have a slight fever?
How about your period?

257
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think it's been coming a bit late...

258
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,500
Oh, my God!

259
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:45,733
Kotoko. You're pregnant.

260
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,000
What?

261
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:50,633
I knew it, I knew it. Those symptoms!

262
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:53,367
Kotoko? Really?

263
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,133
I don't know. But...

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,433
Remember!

265
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,967
Do you remember having "relations?"

266
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:04,567
Well, I guess we could have...

267
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,233
I was waiting for this day!

268
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,567
Kotoko and Naoki's baby!
It's a dream come true.

269
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,267
But, Mom.

270
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,433
Listen to me, Kotoko.

271
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,667
I've had two children.
I know about these things!

272
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,300
Where is Naoki at a time like this?

273
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,533
What bad timing!

274
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:32,800
Oh my, God! I have to tell Dad!
And your dad!

275
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,633
I want to tell the entire world!

276
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,700
Calm down, Mrs. Irie!

277
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,667
<i>Me? Pregnant?</i>

278
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:50,433
<i>Naoki and my baby? In my stomach?</i>

279
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,967
Congratulations, Kotoko!

280
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,633
That's great! Congrats!

281
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,567
<i>It doesn't feel real... Does it?</i>

282
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,233
<i>Are you in here, baby?</i>

283
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,433
Kotoko!

284
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,200
Are you pregnant?

285
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,467
Is it true, Kotoko?

286
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:26,133
I haven't seen a doctor yet.

287
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,300
There's no doubt. I'm a veteran.

288
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,033
Go to the doctor with Naoki.

289
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,833
Right, grandpas?

290
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Grandpa...?

291
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,433
Grandpa.

292
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:57,467
Congratulations, Kotoko.

293
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,100
Congrats.

294
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,867
Congratulations, Kotoko!

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Please take care of yourself.

296
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,533
Hello, Miss Aihara.

297
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,067
Matsumoto.

298
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,467
I heard you're pregnant.
Congratulations.

299
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,933
Who told you?

300
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,567
Didn't you know?

301
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,500
Naoki's mom is tweeting it
all over the place.

302
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,833
What?

303
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:40,200
Now you have a legitimate excuse
to withdraw from academic life.

304
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:44,833
Good luck. Guess what.
You're full of surprises!

305
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,467
See you.

306
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:58,167
The tweet about the pregnancy
is spread worldwide.

307
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,967
It's not a joke.

308
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:05,233
Even the professor
congratulated me. In class!

309
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,067
I don't even feel pregnant.
I don't know what to say.

310
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,667
Why? It's happy news.

311
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:12,700
Yeah.

312
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Look how tiny these are.

313
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:21,133
This is a birdie print.

314
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:26,433
Diaper covers are
so much cuter nowadays.

315
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,167
And look at this! Angel wings!
How adorable!

316
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:36,700
Mom, there's so much pink.

317
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:41,967
Of course! Because I want a girl!

318
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:46,367
I'm counting on you.

319
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,500
Okay.

320
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm home! This is heavy!

321
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,867
Right this way, please.

322
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,233
Kotoko, look at this!

323
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,167
I know it's a little premature, but...

324
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,667
I couldn't help myself. Baby stuff!

325
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,833
You too, Dad?

326
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,733
You too, Mom? What a coincidence!

327
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,067
Thank you for your help.

328
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,067
Look! Look!

329
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,100
This is a car. Vroom, vroom!

330
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:24,300
This is a plane. Whoosh!

331
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:29,533
Dad, this all looks like boy stuff.

332
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,233
Well, I guess.

333
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,767
It's our first grandchild.
It has to be a son.

334
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,600
Are you kidding?
It'll be a girl, of course!

335
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,133
A boy.

336
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,533
No, a girl.

337
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,067
A grandson first.

338
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,533
No, a girl!

339
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,333
-A boy!
-It has to be a girl.

340
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,733
-I'm sure it's a boy.
-But I want a girl.

341
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,600
Look at them, all worked up.

342
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,600
-A boy.
-No, a girl.

343
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,067
-Boy.
-I said a girl!

344
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,467
Kotoko!

345
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,600
Kotoko!

346
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,800
Eat this. It's from my restaurant.

347
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:15,333
A special congratulatory
feast for the baby.

348
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:17,967
Eat it!

349
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:18,967
Dad.

350
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,667
-Don't hold back. Eat!
-But...

351
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,833
I forgot the chopsticks!

352
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,733
I think it's a little early...

353
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,933
<i>I'm starting to feel pregnant.</i>

354
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,500
<i>Me and Naoki's baby...</i>

355
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,700
<i>I'm sure it'll be adorable.</i>

356
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:47,567
<i>How will Naoki react</i>
<i>when he comes home tomorrow?</i>

357
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,700
<i>Will he be happy?</i>

358
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:06,200
TO NAOKI, RING THE BELL TWICE.
FROM MOM

359
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,600
-There he is!
-It's him!

360
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,600
-Hurry!
-Okay.

361
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,967
You, too, Kotoko.

362
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,100
Congratulations!

363
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,300
What is this commotion about?

364
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,967
Want to know, Naoki?

365
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,400
I would love to.

366
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,533
Kotoko, go ahead. Tell him.

367
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:48,733
Welcome home.

368
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,600
Thanks.

369
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,533
You said "um" three times.

370
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Okay.

371
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,100
Oh, sorry.

372
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,833
I think I'm...

373
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,367
What did you say?

374
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:27,700
I think I'm pregnant.

375
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,933
Yes!

376
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,000
Are you sure?

377
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,600
Probably.

378
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,500
-Have you seen a doctor?
-Not yet, but Mom said...

379
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:48,567
Let's go.

380
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,667
Go where?

381
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
{\an8}HOSHIGAOKA GENERAL HOSPITAL

382
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:07,800
Aren't you embarrassed
to be in a place like this?

383
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:10,100
No.

384
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:15,733
I'm going to be a doctor.
The smell of hospital is rather calming.

385
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,833
Naoki...

386
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,167
What did you think when
you first heard about the baby?

387
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:43,300
Mrs. Kotoko Irie? Please come in.

388
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:44,567
Yes!

389
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,367
I'm going.

390
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,567
I'm sorry! Really sorry!

391
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,967
So you're not pregnant after all.

392
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
No, I'm not. I'm sorry!

393
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,833
I made a big, big mistake.

394
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:58,533
The doctor said it was just indigestion,
and the period will start soon.

395
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:00,767
God.

396
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,300
You should have checked
with a doctor first.

397
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,900
I'm sure my mom
blew things out of proportion.

398
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:15,067
But I made her so hopeful.

399
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,667
If you're not pregnant,
you're not pregnant.

400
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,400
What else can you say?

401
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,667
But...

402
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,200
I can't believe it wasn't a baby.

403
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,233
What's wrong?

404
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,200
Are you depressed?

405
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,267
Naoki.

406
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,133
You'll catch a cold.

407
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,667
I'm fine.

408
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:02,367
My stomach is weak,
but my body is strong.

409
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,567
But I'm stupid.

410
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,433
You're right.

411
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:10,067
You're supposed to disagree!

412
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,267
How can I disagree?

413
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,733
Naoki...

414
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,033
I like looking at the sky with you.

415
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:36,367
I hope we'll always
look at things together.

416
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,133
Yeah.

417
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,633
I've...

418
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,433
...been thinking
about this for a while.

419
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,800
I know I take things
too lightly sometimes.

420
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,133
I don't even know if I deserve
to do something like this.

421
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:16,800
Do what?

422
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,333
I...

423
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,933
...was thinking about
what I wanted to do most.

424
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,033
You may think it's a stupid idea but...

425
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,700
I...

426
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,400
What I want to do most

427
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,967
is to help you do your job.

428
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,967
In other words, become a nurse.

429
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,133
After seeing the doctor
and nurse today,

430
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,267
I'm now so sure.

431
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:01,033
I'm going to study hard

432
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,067
and when I graduate,
I want to be a nurse.

433
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:10,100
I know you'll say it's a job
that involves life and death.

434
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:13,167
But I really believe in this.

435
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,767
So...

436
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,667
I want to be a nurse.

437
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:25,933
What do you think?

438
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,767
What do I think?

439
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:38,100
I hope you realize that
people's lives will be in your hands.

440
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,967
One mistake could be fatal.

441
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:45,467
I know. I thought about that.

442
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:50,333
It's not like working part-time.
It's a big decision.

443
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:52,967
I know! I'm not taking it lightly.

444
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,867
Doctors and nurses

445
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:58,633
have to want to help people.

446
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:02,400
Do you really want to do that?

447
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:05,767
I want to help you!

448
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,233
I want to be useful to you!

449
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:12,367
If I become a nurse and help patients,

450
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,900
I can help you with your work, right?

451
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:18,433
Then, I'll do whatever
it takes to help patients.

452
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,633
This one thing I can assure you
that I really want to do!

453
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,900
You're incredible.

454
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,867
Naoki?

455
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,133
If I tried to stop you,
you wouldn't listen.

456
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,200
So...

457
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,967
Give it a try.

458
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,167
Naoki...

459
00:33:56,033 --> 00:34:01,000
You'll have to transfer
to the nursing course first.

460
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:05,067
If you pass the exam,
then we're talking.

461
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,633
The transfer exam...

462
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:13,133
So I have to pass the exam...

463
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,533
Of course.

464
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,900
Okay! I'll do it!

465
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,133
At the hospital today,

466
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:45,800
you asked me what I thought
when you told me you were pregnant.

467
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,767
Yeah.

468
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,400
And when I came home,

469
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,833
you first told me you were pregnant...

470
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,967
...to be honest,

471
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,167
my mind went totally blank.

472
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,800
But at the hospital,

473
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:14,000
I was thinking while
you were with doctor for checkup.

474
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,167
I did have a feeling that you weren't.

475
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,633
But if

476
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,633
you really were,

477
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,767
in those few, short minutes,

478
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,800
I felt like a parent.

479
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,700
How did it feel to be a dad?

480
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:41,800
I liked it.

481
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,300
Me, too.

482
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,167
I kind of

483
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,700
want a baby now.

484
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:06,567
Should we make one?

485
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,000
Naoki...

486
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,300
Me, too.

487
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:21,167
<i>For the short time that Naoki's baby</i>
<i>was in my heart,</i>

488
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:23,500
<i>I was the happiest girl in the world.</i>

489
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,233
<i>So,</i>

490
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,700
<i>one day,</i>

491
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:39,467
<i>I hope I'll see you again.</i>

492
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,567
<i>Our baby!</i>

493
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,833
I don't understand this at all.

494
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,200
Kotoko, let's go.

495
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,100
Naoki!

496
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,767
I'm stuck here. Can you help me out?

497
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:09,367
Why me? I thought you were
going to manage on your own.

498
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,633
Let's go.

499
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,600
Just a little!

500
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,033
A little.

501
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,267
I'm busy, too.

502
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:20,433
Why don't you get it?

503
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,900
I told you about it just seconds ago.

504
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,733
Did you?

505
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,100
Apply this formula here!

506
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,467
What formula?

507
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,667
Naoki...?

508
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,933
You have to think for yourself.

509
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,733
What?

510
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,733
You look cute when you're mad.

511
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,933
Unbelievable...

512
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
That's cute, too!

513
00:37:58,733 --> 00:37:59,733
Stupid!

514
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,833
Sorry.

515
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:08,500
<i>Time passed as he scolded me</i>
<i>day after day.</i>

516
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:11,967
TONAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF NURSING

517
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,267
TRANSFER TEST SITE

518
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,067
I'm so nervous.

519
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:25,100
Nerves won't help you at this point.
Forget about it.

520
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:29,200
I know, but...

521
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,800
What I'm worried about is...

522
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,900
What?

523
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,933
...whether or not you'll
remember your ID number.

524
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:40,933
Of course I'll remember that!

525
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:42,967
Oh!

526
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:52,967
Oh, my God! My ID card!

527
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,833
You left it on your desk.

528
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,800
Thank goodness.

529
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,633
Are you going to be all right?

530
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,500
Of course! I'm a good test taker.

531
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,433
Leave it to me!

532
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:17,067
Naoki.

533
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,267
I love you.

534
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,533
Okay!

535
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,800
Let's go for a drink.
My treat tonight.

536
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,000
Really? Thanks!

537
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,733
Kinnosuke.

538
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,733
I was waiting for you. Let's go home.

539
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,000
Chris!

540
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,133
How many times
do I have to tell you?

541
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,133
My heart still belongs to Kotoko.

542
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:17,567
I can't change how I feel
just because she got married.

543
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:21,267
Anyways, you're a young lady.

544
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:24,400
You shouldn't be out
by yourself at night. It's dangerous!

545
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,867
I know but...

546
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,100
