1
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,500
All because of us...

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,233
It doesn't even concern you.

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:18,900
It does concern me.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,433
Don't say that it doesn't.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,033
You should...

6
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,500
...leave him.

7
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:39,267
You're jealous.

8
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:44,000
Me? Jealous?

9
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,833
You don't love me anymore, do you?

10
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,467
That's not it...

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,833
You never loved me!

12
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:55,833
Calm down!

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,500
No! Why...

14
00:00:58,733 --> 00:00:59,600
Why...

15
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,367
...did you marry me?

16
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:13,133
I'm the only one...that loves you.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,667
I can't do this!

18
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,667
Kotoko!

19
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,233
<i>Something I was always</i>
<i>too scared to ask him about.</i>

20
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:34,333
<i>But the question was always in my heart,</i>
<i>and I finally let it come out.</i>

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,333
<i>I put an end to it myself...</i>

22
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Are we...finished?</i>

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,400
Another busy day.

24
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:09,167
Sorry, we're closed.

25
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,700
Kotoko?

26
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,867
-What's wrong, Kotoko?
-Kotoko!

27
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,300
Hey, hey...

28
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,500
Are you okay?

29
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,533
Have some tea, eh?

30
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,200
Are you fighting with Naoki again?

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I told him he'd better not
make you cry anymore.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,600
How pitiful.
You're going home with me.

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,633
No, I'm not!

34
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:45,767
Naoki will be worried.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,700
He doesn't care
what I do or how I do it.

36
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,967
I don't know what happened,
but it's late.

37
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,100
Please! Don't tell him I'm here.

38
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,267
I...

39
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,833
...can't go home.

40
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:17,600
Kotoko! Come stay with me.

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,133
-Really?
-Yes, of course!

42
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,500
Or my apartment.
Stay as long as you like.

43
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,133
Kinnosuke!

44
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:28,500
Hello? Kotoko is here.

45
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,667
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

46
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,567
<i>She's going to stay</i>
<i>with Chris tonight.</i>

47
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:37,933
Give her time. She'll calm down.

48
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
Sorry to worry you.

49
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,200
Thank you.

50
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
See you.

51
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,833
{\an8}MISCHIEVOUS KISS 2

52
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,433
{\an8}A VOW WITH A NURSE CAP

53
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,600
Aren't you eating?

54
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,267
Not right now.

55
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you okay?

56
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:28,367
She had a fight with Mr. Irie,
ran away and got smashed.

57
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,933
Poor Kotoko!

58
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:38,300
Girls with hangovers are so unseemly.

59
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,167
Here!

60
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,533
Keita.

61
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,400
This works the quickest. Drink it.

62
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,933
Thanks.

63
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,167
Hey, Chris!

64
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't see!

65
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,167
What are you doing?

66
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,067
It's him! Him!

67
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,900
You're so sweet to Kotoko.

68
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,400
It's bitter!

69
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,833
Did you really run away?

70
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,800
We can hear everything.

71
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,300
Lecture her for me, will you?

72
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,400
You fought with Irie, right?

73
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:30,533
Want to stay with me?

74
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,733
It's a small apartment.

75
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Wait a minute. Are you kidding?

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,567
I told you I was serious.

77
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,767
I love you.

78
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,367
That idiot! What is he...?

79
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,433
Where are you going? Kinnosuke!

80
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,633
I can't keep my mind off of you.

81
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,500
But... I'm Naoki's...

82
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,067
So leave him!

83
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,367
Has he come running after you?

84
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,167
He's not even jealous.

85
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,700
What has he done for you?

86
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,567
That's not a marriage.

87
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,700
Married couples need each other.

88
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,000
You need me.

89
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:36,633
Wrong.

90
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Totally wrong.

91
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,100
Naoki...

92
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,100
You're too late.
You only made Kotoko suffer.

93
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,800
You can't make her happy.

94
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,733
You had no right to marry her!

95
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,267
What's going on?

96
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,333
Kamogari and Kotoko? An affair?

97
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,400
That may have been true.

98
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,400
Not "may have been."

99
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,133
It was true!

100
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,600
I was jealous.

101
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:20,200
I was jealous of you.

102
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:29,133
I've never been jealous or envious.

103
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:34,433
I've never been dejected
or experienced any of those

104
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,667
disgraceful, messy
human emotions before.

105
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:40,700
But...

106
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,667
...that all changed when Kotoko
came into my life.

107
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,167
All those hidden emotions
made me lose control.

108
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,433
I didn't know how to handle it.

109
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,600
They bewildered and irritated me.

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,167
So what?

111
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:08,833
Kamogari,
you have more than your share

112
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:12,633
of messy, disgraceful emotions.

113
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,333
What? Are you picking a fight?

114
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,800
I was paying you a compliment.

115
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,200
I don't envy you, though.

116
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:28,333
That's why you don't need Kotoko.

117
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,333
She's for me. I need her.

118
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,233
What...?

119
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,133
I can only be my true self

120
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,567
when I'm with Kotoko.

121
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,367
Really? Naoki.

122
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes.

123
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,733
I didn't even realize it until...

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,767
Kinnosuke told me.

125
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
Kin-chan?

126
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,733
He came running over to get me.

127
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:07,967
I can't believe...
he felt this way for six years.

128
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,133
He's amazing.

129
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,133
I'm just a better human being.

130
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,233
Naoki...

131
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,967
Is it...

132
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
Is it...

133
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,833
Is it really okay for me to stay?

134
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,300
I just told you "yes."

135
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll never...

136
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,567
...leave you until the day I die!

137
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm counting on it.

138
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,200
-Congrats!
-How romantic!

139
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,900
We're in the cafeteria!

140
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:16,400
I guess I lack modesty, too.

141
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,367
You...

142
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,100
How sweet.

143
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,733
What, Motoki!

144
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,033
What have you done?

145
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,633
You just strengthened
their marital bond.

146
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,367
Just for now...

147
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,700
You...

148
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,133
...love rescuing people in need.

149
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:09,867
That's what it was.

150
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,633
You wanted to rescue Kotoko...
Right, Keita?

151
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,767
That's one way to look at it.

152
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,633
There will be plenty of patients

153
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,733
for you to rescue.

154
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,667
Don't focus on just one.

155
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,333
I'm not giving up on Mr. Irie, though.

156
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,900
We're home!

157
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,733
You're home, Kotoko!

158
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,767
Oh... my!

159
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:59,133
What happened? You made up?

160
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,567
Sorry to worry you, Mom.

161
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,633
But we made up.

162
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,500
I'm so glad.

163
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,100
Stop hanging on me.

164
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:23,067
Come on.

165
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,400
So, what happened?

166
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:33,467
In front of everyone, Naoki...

167
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,500
...professed his love for me!

168
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,833
Naoki! You come through
when it counts!

169
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,733
You! You! You!

170
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,800
You did?!

171
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:55,000
"I can only be my true self
when I'm with Kotoko."

172
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,533
-Yes!
-Hey!

173
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,333
What a great line!

174
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,333
He loves you so much!

175
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:10,667
Now that you made up,
you'll be a real husband and wife!

176
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,933
Thank you, Kotoko.

177
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:21,367
Naoki has matured so much
since he's been with you.

178
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,667
He understands how other people feel.

179
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,467
I think your love melted

180
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,300
his cold, icy heart.

181
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,200
My love...? Well...

182
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,900
Don't ever give up on him.

183
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,867
No. Of course not.

184
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:56,067
We have to celebrate
your getting back together.

185
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's! What should we do?

186
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,900
-Shall we bake a cake?
-Yes! I'll help you.

187
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,967
Ms. Irie.

188
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:15,633
You failed the injection,
vital sign checks

189
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,100
and wheelchair exercises.

190
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,533
It's not looking very good.

191
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,167
Training at the hospital
begins next month.

192
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,767
Yes...

193
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,600
I'll retest you tomorrow.

194
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:35,800
If you don't pass,
you'll have to repeat a year.

195
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,233
Okay?

196
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,467
Oh, no!

197
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,333
NEXT DAY

198
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,267
Kotoko!

199
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,367
What are you doing here?

200
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,233
Oh... Keita.

201
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,467
I'm being retested today.

202
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,900
A spot check on everything
we've learned.

203
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:32,033
I've been practicing since 6 a.m.,
but I still can't do it.

204
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,700
You wasted so many syringes.

205
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:45,267
I can't do anything right.

206
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
No even an injection.

207
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,367
I don't even know
if I can become a nurse.

208
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,100
And...

209
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,300
This is no time for blubbering.

210
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,800
Here. Use my arm.

211
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,967
It's easy, once you get the hang of it.

212
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:23,167
Don't worry about messing up.
Just go for it.

213
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,633
Really?

214
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,167
Yeah.

215
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:30,767
Okay...

216
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,633
Here I go.

217
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,100
Hey!

218
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,200
Use the rubber arm!

219
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:44,867
Sorry...

220
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:52,067
I'll get it this time.

221
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,900
Look at the needle.

222
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,500
Yes.

223
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,833
Kotoko, relax!

224
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,433
You're always telling me that.

225
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,733
Your anxiety will only make
the patient nervous.

226
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:18,567
Relax!

227
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,733
Okay, one more time!

228
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay.

229
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,433
I did it! I did it!

230
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,367
You did it, Kotoko!

231
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,133
I finally did it! Thanks, Keita!

232
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,633
And while we're at it...

233
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,667
Can I ask you one more favor?

234
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,867
Kotoko, you're too tense.

235
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Okay...

236
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,567
Take your time.

237
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,600
Yes.

238
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,033
Focus!

239
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:20,533
Yes.

240
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,267
Don't panic.

241
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:31,733
-Gentle and slow.
-Okay.

242
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,067
You got it.

243
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,333
I did it! Yes!

244
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,867
Congratulations.

245
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,300
It's all thanks to you.

246
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,300
I'll never forget this feeling!

247
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,067
Why do you want to become a nurse?

248
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:08,467
You know... was it a childhood dream?

249
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,933
Do you want to help the sick?

250
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,600
Well...

251
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,633
I...

252
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:18,500
want to help Naoki because
he's going to be a doctor.

253
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,633
Is that all?

254
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,667
No...

255
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,467
I'm a klutz and I'm not good at anything.

256
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,733
I'm a burden to you all.

257
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:32,033
But if I could be of help to someone,

258
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:36,367
like provide moral support
to a patient feeling scared...

259
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,933
But, Naoki still comes first.

260
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,900
You're incredible.

261
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,867
I guess you're happy with him.

262
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:00,933
Yes.

263
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,033
Good luck on your test.

264
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,433
Thanks... Keita.

265
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,900
Hey!

266
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,067
What are you doing here so early?

267
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,000
I was being a pin cushion
for your wife.

268
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:36,867
She's being retested today.

269
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,867
Well, thanks for your help.

270
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,700
You're something else.

271
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,533
I decided not to pursue Kotoko
anymore.

272
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,133
No matter how terrible
a husband you are.

273
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,367
As long as Kotoko is happy.

274
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,467
I'll keep my mouth shut.

275
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:18,100
So you accepted the fact
that you can't compete

276
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,833
with her strong feelings for me.

277
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,867
Too bad it took you so long.

278
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:31,600
Is this how you treat a guy
who just conceded?

279
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,867
You conceited jerk!

280
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,067
Take care of her.

281
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,000
What's this?

282
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:08,433
A special omelet.
I told Kin-chan I passed the test.

283
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,567
Now we can all train together!

284
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:12,667
Yes!

285
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,233
But before that...

286
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
It's almost here.

287
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,600
What is?

288
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,333
The capping ceremony, of course.

289
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:27,167
What's a capping ceremony?

290
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,600
What?

291
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,867
You've never hear
of the capping ceremony?

292
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,967
I transferred mid-term.

293
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:39,800
So what? A capping ceremony

294
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:44,333
is the first step
in becoming a real nurse.

295
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,333
Like a coming-of-age ceremony
for nurses.

296
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,000
I see.

297
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:52,367
We get "capped" by the head nurse.

298
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,967
Holding candles! How romantic.

299
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,900
I've dreamt of this day for so long.

300
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,100
My own nurse's cap.

301
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,200
My first step towards
becoming a "nightingale."

302
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,900
It's not an exaggeration

303
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,800
to say I chose this path
just for this auspicious event!

304
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,600
Is it that great?

305
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,267
And there's something else.

306
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,167
What?

307
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:24,200
A guy from the medical school
presents you with flowers!

308
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,933
-Flowers?
-Yes!

309
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:29,700
It's a tradition unique
to Tonan University.

310
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,433
When we finish the ceremony,
a med student is waiting for you

311
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,700
with a bouquet of flowers!

312
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:42,333
A once in a lifetime event.
Everyone is

313
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:46,400
desperately looking for someone
to give them a bouquet.

314
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,900
I'm so lucky!

315
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,867
Kotoko!

316
00:25:58,467 --> 00:25:59,400
Congratulations.

317
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,567
The cap looks good on you.

318
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,600
I love you.

319
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,533
Naoki...

320
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:13,967
<i>Just imagining it--</i>

321
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:18,967
<i>It's too wonderful to be true!</i>

322
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:23,233
<i>I'm getting a bouquet from Naoki.</i>

323
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,767
It's no use. She's in dreamland.

324
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,000
Who should I ask?

325
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,233
What about Mr. Funatsu?
He'd be happy to.

326
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,067
Are you kidding me?

327
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,433
I haven't seen Mr. Funatsu lately.

328
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,367
The parasite museum
was closed yesterday.

329
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,500
Speak of the devil.

330
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,867
Mr. Irie?

331
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,200
Are you listening? Mr. Irie?

332
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,867
You complain too much.

333
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,333
Mr. Irie!

334
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,433
Naoki!

335
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,233
I don't feel well.

336
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,767
Naoki! Where's Mr. Funatsu?

337
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:24,067
He's not feeling well.

338
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,733
He's lying.

339
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:27,733
What?

340
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,867
You were 1 again, weren't you?

341
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Yeah.

342
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,933
You said you bombed the test,
but you still...

343
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,133
My husband is amazing.

344
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:43,967
What are you doing?

345
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,267
I knew it.

346
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,567
Mr. Funatsu...

347
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,167
He talked all big, but he's still <i>2.</i>

348
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:54,900
That's why he can't face me.
What a coward!

349
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,467
Is he a man or what?

350
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:03,533
Naoki, I have a favor to ask...

351
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:08,467
The capping ceremony is coming up.

352
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:13,200
There's a tradition of giving flowers
to the nurses...

353
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm so happy...

354
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,900
I'll appreciate anything,
but I prefer roses...

355
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,267
I can't.

356
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:27,500
I'll be at a conference in Nagoya
with my professor.

357
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:29,900
What?!

358
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,700
But... but!

359
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,133
We'll probably stay overnight.

360
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,533
In any case,

361
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,233
I have no interest in participating
in such an embarrassing tradition.

362
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,800
It's ridiculous.

363
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,300
See you.

364
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,667
So mean!

365
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:54,200
Mr. Irie was so popular last year.

366
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:00,433
So many of the nurses asked him,
but he rejected them all, so...

367
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:01,833
So?

368
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,500
The capping ceremony
is just around the corner.

369
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,633
Today, I've asked the head nurse

370
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:13,300
of Tonan University Hospital
to say a few words.

371
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,533
I'm Nurse Hosoi. Nice to meet you.

372
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,667
What presence!

373
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:25,433
She's famous for her "big presence."

374
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,467
She's also known for picking on nurses
she doesn't like.

375
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:32,433
I hope I'm never on her black list.

376
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,133
I heard there's a Mrs. Irie
in this class.

377
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,833
Yes. I'm Kotoko Irie.

378
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,200
You're Mrs. Irie?

379
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:47,967
Your husband is an intern
at our hospital.

380
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:52,033
He's so capable!
He's the talk of the ward.

381
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:56,533
I expect you to be just as capable.

382
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,433
Well...

383
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,133
Yes, she is.

384
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh, how promising!

385
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,933
Let's get down to business.

386
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,433
At the upcoming ceremony,

387
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:13,467
I'd like 4 of you to recite
the "Nightingale Pledge."

388
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:14,800
Me! Me! Me!

389
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,367
Yes?

390
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,967
My name is Motoki Kikyo.
May I volunteer?

391
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,100
Are you a man?

392
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,233
You cannot!

393
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Why? Nurse Hosoi!

394
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,200
At Tonan, the Nightingale Pledge

395
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,767
has always been recited
by female students.

396
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,033
Unfortunately, I have no use for you.

397
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:48,533
Furthermore, male students
don't get capped.

398
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:51,033
They get a badge.

399
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:56,533
My... dream...

400
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:01,933
I lived for this day...

401
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,967
I choose Miss Ogura.

402
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,000
Yes.

403
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,000
-Miss Mori.
-Yes.

404
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,433
-Miss Shinagawa.
-Yes.

405
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:17,300
And lastly, Mrs. Kotoko Irie.

406
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,667
I'm counting on you.

407
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,933
Moto-chan, slow down!

408
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,767
Why do you two get to recite
the Nightingale Pledge?

409
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,467
You asked us that already!

410
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,100
I don't even want to do it.

411
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,100
Me, either.

412
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,933
It's your fault.
You told her I was capable.

413
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:57,033
Now I have to recite the last
and longest part!

414
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:01,867
I don't even get a nurse's cap.

415
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,633
My phone.

416
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,367
Hello?

417
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,733
"I will hold in confidence

418
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,933
all personal matters
committed to my keeping,

419
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:24,233
and all family affairs
coming to my knowledge

420
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,967
in the practice of my calling."

421
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,133
Wow, Moto-chan!

422
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,533
You're really bad
at remembering things.

423
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,667
But you'd better memorize this!

424
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,467
You have to make me proud.

425
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:45,933
And don't embarrass your husband.

426
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:51,800
I know, but it's got the pressure.

427
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,367
"I will endeavor to aid the physician

428
00:32:55,467 --> 00:33:00,267
and devote myself to the welfare
of those committed to my care."

429
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:01,633
Moto-chan!

430
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,600
What?

431
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:07,333
I have a great idea!

432
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,633
What?

433
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:13,133
At the capping ceremony...

434
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,367
What?

435
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,600
<i>One week later. The day of</i>
<i>the capping ceremony finally arrived.</i>

436
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,433
And now...

437
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:32,967
...the Tonan University Nursing School
Capping Ceremony will begin.

438
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,533
Marina Shinagawa.

439
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yes.

440
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:46,100
Good luck.

441
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,267
Tomoko Ogura.

442
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,300
Yes.

443
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,867
Hey. Where's Motoki?

444
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,333
Keita Kamogari.

445
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,367
Yes.

446
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,333
Kotoko Irie.

447
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Yes.

448
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,867
Good luck.

449
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,700
<i>Naoki...</i>

450
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:38,900
<i>I'm one step closer to you now.</i>

451
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:49,367
<i>I wish you could see me</i>
<i>in my nurse's cap.</i>

452
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:53,267
Motoki Kikyo.

453
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:54,267
Yes.

454
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:00,933
Motoki!

455
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,833
Wha...?

456
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,300
What is this?

457
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,300
Go change immediately!
You'll desecrate the capping ceremony!

458
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,033
Nurse Hosoi! Please don't!

459
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,800
Moto-chan worked so hard for this!

460
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,833
Men and women care equally
for their patients. Please!

461
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,000
-Kotoko...
-Please let him do this!

462
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,067
We beg of you!

463
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,900
I don't want a nurse's cap...

464
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,600
but please let Motoki wear one.

465
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:43,500
-I agree.
-We all do!

466
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,900
Fine.

467
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,733
You win. I'll make an exception
and give Mr. Kikyo a nurse's cap.

468
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,500
Really?

469
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,900
Congrats, Moto-chan!

470
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:10,067
Thank you, Kotoko! You did it.

471
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,033
Thank you, everyone! I love you!

472
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,333
Good luck.

473
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,600
Thank you, Nurse Hosoi.

474
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:46,533
<i>An exception was made</i>

475
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,233
<i>and Moto-chan got a nurse's cap.</i>

476
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:13,700
I solemnly pledge myself before God
and in the presence of this assembly.

477
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:19,733
To pass my life in purity and to practice
my profession faithfully.

478
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:24,867
I will abstain from whatever is
deleterious and mischievous,

479
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:31,267
and will not take or knowingly administer
any harmful drug.

480
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:34,467
I will do all in my power

481
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:38,300
to maintain and elevate the standard
of my profession...

482
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:44,900
--and will hold in confidence all personal
matters committed to my keeping

483
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,467
and all family affairs coming
to my knowledge

484
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,933
in the practice of my calling.

485
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,367
With loyalty will I...

486
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,100
<i>Naoki.</i>

487
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,933
--endeavor to aid
the physician in his work...

488
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,500
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

489
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,933
--and devote myself to the welfare

490
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:10,667
of those committed to my care.

491
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,333
<i>I'll do my best to help you.</i>

492
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:32,467
<i>Naoki's not coming home</i>
<i>tonight anyways.</i>

493
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,400
<i>Maybe I'll just sit here a while longer.</i>

494
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:47,933
<i>Nursing is demanding. Academically,</i>
<i>emotionally and physically.</i>

495
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,800
<i>But I think I can do it.</i>

496
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:56,333
<i>When I feel discouraged,</i>
<i>I'll look back on this day...</i>

497
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:07,533
Who is it? A ghost?

498
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,767
Idiot.

499
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,433
Naoki?!

500
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:21,800
What are you still doing here?

501
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,367
What about your duty in Nagoya?

502
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,733
I took the bullet train back.

503
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,467
You came back...

504
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:33,733
...for me?

505
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,767
I didn't make it in time, though.

506
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,500
The florist was closed.

507
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
I don't care.

508
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,800
I don't need flowers.

509
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
You came...

510
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:52,867
Say it...

511
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,933
The part you recited.

512
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:58,167
Okay.

513
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,867
"With loyalty

514
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:06,367
will I endeavor to aid
the physician in his work

515

518
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,467
Again.

519
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:29,600
"I will endeavor to aid the physician

Ep.08 "RIVALRY WITH GRANDMA TOYO"

529

{\an8}We start training at the hospital
next week. I'm so nervous.

530
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm sure she's a really sweet old lady!

531
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:06,100
You two may get along well.

532
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,600
I can't be remembering trainee's names.

533
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,567
She called me 8 times
this morning alone!

534
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,033
She's a bully!

535
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:17,033
I'm losing confidence.

536
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:19,433
Are you going to quit?
