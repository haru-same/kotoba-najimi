Hello?

Nancy?

00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,617
Nancy!

00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,453

[voice echoes]

12
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,355
Hey, what's the matter?

13
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,441
Nothing.

14
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,694

Steve?

00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,504
-Hey, Steve.
-Mmm.

28
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,258
I'll...

29
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,302
see you tomorrow, okay?

30
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,431
Mmm-hmm.

[owl hooting]

32
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,633
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

33
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,885
Oh, I scared you?

34
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,178
I know, I should have called.

35
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,846
[loudly] Where have you been?

36
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,389
[softly] We agreed on 10:00.

37
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,434
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

38
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,518
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

39
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,771
You didn't think to call and let me know?

40
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,522
With everything that's been going on?

41
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,358
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

42
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,194
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

43
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,570
Hey, wait...

44
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,821
Whose sweatshirt is that?

45
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,574
Steve's.

46
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,367
Steve's.

47
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,703
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

48
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,079
What?

49
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,164
No!

50
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,292
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

51
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,627
It's not a big deal.

52
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,879
Nancy?

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,547
What?

54
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,009
You can talk to me.

55
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,970
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

56
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,765
Nothing happened.

57
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,769
Nancy.

58
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,689
Nothing happened.

59
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,151
Can I please go?

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,665
[swing creaking]

61
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,011
[Joyce softly] Will? Will?

62
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,765
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

63
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
Will...

64
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,184
Please...

65
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,894
Will...

66
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,020
[grunts]

67
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:55,981
It's me.

68
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,568
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

69
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,653
Just say... [stammers]

70
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,905
-Mom?
-Jonathan!

71
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,866
-[stammering] Come here. Come here.
-Mom, what is this?

72
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,494
Come here. Come here.
[sniffles]

73
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,913
-What's going on?
-It's Will. It's Will, he's...

74
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,832
he's trying to talk to me.

75
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,792
[breath trembling]

76
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,004
-He's trying to talk to you?
-Yes, through... through the lights.

77
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,213
-Mom--
-I know.

78
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,673
I know.

79
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,883
Just... just watch.

80
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,554
Will... your brother's here.

81
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,433
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

82
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,312
Please...
[gasps] Did you see that?

83
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,355
It's the electricity, Mom.

84
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,690
-[stammering] It's acting up.
-No.

85
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,358
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

86
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,986
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

87
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,280
Something is going on here!

88
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,991
-Yesterday, the wall--
-What? What about the wall?

89
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,243
-I don't know. I don't know.
-Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

90
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,704
[stammers] I just know that Will is here.

91
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,289
-[sighs]
-No, Mom.

92
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,042
-[stammering] Maybe if I get more lamps--
-No, Mom.

93
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,546
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

94
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,798
He is just lost.

95
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,969
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

96
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,638
[stammering] Okay.

97
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,932
-This isn't helping.
-Okay, okay.

98
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,309
Okay, I'm sorry.
[sniffling] I'm sorry.

99
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,645
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

100
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

101
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,232
-[sniffling] Yeah.
-Huh? Can you do that for me?

102
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,567
-I promise. I will.
-Yeah?

103
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,611
-Yeah.
-I just need to sit here for a minute.

104
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,695
[sniffles]

105
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,572
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

106
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,157
-Okay.
-Yeah?

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,450
[Jonathan sighs]

108
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,752
[whispers] Will?

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,297
[radio static]

110
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,841
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

111
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,511
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

112
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,139
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

113
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,933
-Just trust me on this, okay?
-Okay.

114
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,518
-Did you get the supplies?
-Yeah.

115
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,229
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

116
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,481
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

117
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,025
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

118
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,277
and the wrist rocket.

119
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,363
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

120
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,907
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

121
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,326
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

122
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
It's made up.

123
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,747
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

124
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,501
-and blind it.
-[sighs] Dustin, what did you get?

125
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,589
Well, alrighty.

126
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,924
So, we've got...

127
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,386
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

128
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,014
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

129
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,266
-banana, and trail mix.
-Seriously?

130
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,852
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

131
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,062
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

132
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,773
-We have her.
-[Lucas] She shut one door!

133
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,025
With her mind!

134
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,777
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

135
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,739
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

136
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,906
Like...

137
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,453
I bet... that she could make this fly!

138
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,165
Hey. Hey.

139
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,833
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,752
[clatters]

141
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,211
Okay, one more time.

142
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,548
-Okay.
-[sighs]

143
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,341
Use your powers, okay?

144
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,926
[clatters]

145
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,428
-Idiot.
-[Mike sighs]

146
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,180
-She's not a dog!
-[Karen] Boys!

147
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,015
Time for school!

148
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,226
Just stay down here.

149
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,562
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

150
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,106
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

151
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,067
-[Karen] Michael!
-Coming!

152
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,526
You know those power lines?

153
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,403
-Power lines?
-Yeah.

154
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,529
The ones behind my house?

155
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,822
Yes.

156
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,449
Meet us there, after school.

157
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,201
After school?

158
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,619
Yeah, 3:15.

159
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,830
Ah.

160
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,506
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

161
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,800
"Three-one-five."

162
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,843
Three-one-five.

163
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,600
[footsteps receding]

164
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,103
[indistinct chatter]

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,412
Hey!

166
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,580
[laughs nervously] Hey!

167
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,166
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah!

168
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,709
Yeah, totally.

169
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,795
I just...

170
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,216
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

171
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,801
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

172
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,136
I know.

173
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,054
I know.
Of course not.

174
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,683
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

175
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,851
You're being paranoid.

176
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,312
-I'm sorry.
-No. No, it's cute.

177
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,524
Hey...

178
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,276
I had a good time.

179
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,320
Yeah.

180
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,115
Yeah.
Me, too.

181
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,792
[both chuckle softly]

182
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,087
Mmm.

Yeah. We are.

356
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,343
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the Times,

357
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,845
and we'll check out the Post.

358
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,097
[scoffs]

359
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,397
The librarian?

360
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,192
[timer ticking]

361
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,903
[Joyce chuckles] Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

362
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

363
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,950
I don't know, he...

364
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,701
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

365
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,286
[stammers] It's silly, I know.

366
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,414
No.
No, it's not silly.

367
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,500
How is Jonathan holding up?

368
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,545
[inhales deeply] You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

369
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,588
He always has been, you know?

370
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,923
I...

371
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,176
[scoffs] I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

372
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,805
Is something the matter?

373
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,223
Uh, no.

374
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,558
No, I just...

375
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,852
We're having electrical problems.

376
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,061
Joyce.

377
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,564
I want you to know something.

378
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,775
If you need anything, anything at all...

379
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,402
Ted and I are here for you.

380
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,529
[Joyce] Thank you.
Thanks.

381
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,905
Okay.

382
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,741
[Joyce] How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

383
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,618
Is he, uh, okay?

384
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,663
[Karen] Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

385
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,290
He skipped school yesterday.

386
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,334
He's never done anything like that before.

387
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,360
[gasps]

388
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,987
[low growling]

389
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,959
-[timer dings]
-Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

390
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,130
Oh, where's Holly?

391
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,761
[breathing heavily]

392
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,436
[Joyce] Hey!

393
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,188
She shouldn't be here.

394
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,775
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

395
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,111
-Wait, did you see something?
-Yeah.

396
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,863
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

397
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,823
-What did you see? What--
-Joyce... Joyce!

398
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,786
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

399
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,120
but I need you to leave.

400
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:08,914
Okay?

401
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,082
[Karen sighs]

402
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,501
-[line ringing]
-Come on, come on, come on...

403
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,546
-[Ms. Holland] Hello?
-Hi.

404
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,507
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

405
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,967
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

406
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,093
Good.
I'm good.

407
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,388
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

408
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,431
Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.

409
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,893
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

410
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,230
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

411
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,109
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

412
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,362
I meant, did she come home this morning?

413
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,615
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

414
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,909
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

415
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,914
Do-- Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

416
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,626
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

417
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,670
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

418
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,089
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,343
[sighs]

420
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,803
[bell rings]

421
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,146
Hey, man.

422
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,272
What's going on?

423
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,357
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

424
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,735
[Carol] We've heard great things.
[Tommy] Yeah, sounds cool.

425
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

426
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,574
[sighs] I don't know
what you're talking about.

427
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,867
[Steve] Oh, no? Oh...
[Jonathan] Hey.

428
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,161
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

429
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,705
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

430
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,040
Here we go.

431
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,833
Ah...

432
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,917
Here we go.

433
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,712
-Oh, man.
-[Tommy] Let me see.

434
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,548
Dude.

435
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,216
[Tommy exclaims]

436
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,551
[scoffs] Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

437
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,261
-I was looking for my brother.
-[Steve] No.

438
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,097
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,434
-What's going on?
-Here's the starring lady.

440
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,643
What?

441
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,771
This creep was spying on us last night.

442
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,107
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

443
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:07,657
[Steve clicks tongue] See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

444
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,785
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

445
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,828
It's hardwired into 'em.

446
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,790
You know, they just can't help themselves.

447
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,752
-[Tommy laughs]
-[Steve] So...

448
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,546
we'll just have to take away his toy.

449
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,757
-Steve...
-No, please, not the camera.

450
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,550
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

451
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,553
-[Tommy chuckles]
-It's okay.

452
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,640
Here you go, man.

453
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,142
[Tommy laughing]

454
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,522
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

455
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,233
Boo.

456
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,611
-[ripping photo]
-[Carol gasps] Bye.

457
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,169
[Steve] Hey, Nance!

458
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,504
Come on.

459
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,983
[breathing heavily]

460
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,365
Three-one-five.

461
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,034
Three-one-five.

462
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,327
[softly] Three-one-five.

463
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,290
[cat meows]

464
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,420
[cat growling]

465
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,679
[hisses]

[cat growls]

467
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,896
[beeping]

468
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,359
[hisses]

469
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,322
[cat snarling]

[whimpers]

472
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,299
[crying]

473
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,022
No! No!

474
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,399
Papa! Papa!

475
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,776
Papa!

476
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,945
Papa!

477
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,321
[screaming] Papa!

478
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,199
[shrieking]

479
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,992
No!

480
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,244
[shrieking]

481
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,836

[sobs]

484
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,503
Incredible.

485
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,382
[sniffles]

486
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,600
[sobbing]

487
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,725
[Mike] El!

488
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
[panting] You okay?

489
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,608
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

490
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

491
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,249
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

492
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,709
-blow me."
-[Tommy laughing]

493
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,128
[Steve] Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

494
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,672
Saturday.

495
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,548
[Tommy] I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

496
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,758
[Carol] Oh, he's so a virgin!

497
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,761
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

498
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,221
[chuckling]

499
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,806
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

500
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,433
[Nancy stammering] I totally forgot.

501
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,102
I told my mom I would, um...

502
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,645
I would do something with her.

503
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,605
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

504
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,148
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,152
[sighs] What the hell's wrong with her?

506
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,197
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

507
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,281
Oh, give me a break.

508
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,659
[Carol] What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

509
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,667
Why did they hurt you?

510
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,877
What?

511
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,464
Oh, that.

512
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,549
Uh...

513
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,300
I just fell at recess.

514
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,429
-Mike...
-Yeah?

515
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,972
Friends tell the truth.

516
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,100
[Mike sighs]

517
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,019
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

518
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,563
Mouth breather?

519
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,565
Yeah, you know...

520
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,774
a dumb person.

521
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,025
A knucklehead.

522
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,193
[Eleven] Knucklehead?

523
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,906
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

524
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,826
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

525
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,036
-Mike...
-Yeah?

526
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,621
I understand.

527
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,957
Oh.

528
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,792
Okay, cool.

529
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,085
Cool.

530
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,484
Barb?

531
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,987
Barb!

532
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,715
Barb?

533
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,594
[rustling]

534
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,727
Barb?

535
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,327
[rustling]

536
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,496
Barb?

537
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,414
[growling]

538
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,499
Oh!

539
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,002
[panting]

540
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,925
[porch swing creaking]

541
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,222
[dog whines]

542
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,892
[barking]

543
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,728
[sighs]

544
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,612
[sniffles]

545
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,574
Will... are you here?

546
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,119
[exclaims]

547
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,038
Okay, good, good, good, good.

548
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,998
Are you...

549
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,127
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

550
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,671
[stammers] Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

551
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,797
Can you do...

552
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,594
[exclaims] Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

553
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,805
[crying] Baby, I need to know...

554
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,434
[exhales heavily] Are you alive?

555
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,272
[sighing]

556
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,693
[softly] Are you safe?

557
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,200
[exclaims]

558
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,124
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

559
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,670
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

560
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,088
Can you...

561
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,759
[whimpering] Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

562
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,721
[voice breaking] Please just...

563
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,806
[mutters]

564
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,142
Will...

565
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,189
[sniffling]

566
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,296
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

567
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,719
Nancy?
What's the matter?

568
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,887
[crying] It's Barb.

569
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,180
I think...

570
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,475
something happened.

571
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,478
[sniffles] Something terrible.

572
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,898
[Powell] I don't know, Chief.

573
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,233
What don't you know?

574
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,486
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

575
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,615
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

576
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,783
She's been discredited.

577
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,951
-[sighs]
-Claim was thrown out--

578
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,161
Okay, forget about her.

579
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,496
Take a look at this.

580
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,790
-Dr. Martin Brenner.
-Who?

581
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,500
Brenner.

582
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,502
He runs Hawkins Lab.

583
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,628
Okay.

584
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,215
[scoffs] You don't find that interesting?

585
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,717
Not really.

586
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,678
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

587
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:39,932
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

588
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,143
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

589
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,229
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

590
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,523
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

591
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,525
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

592
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,028
-Am I wrong?
-I don't know, Chief.

593
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,446
[sighs] Come on, man.

594
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,823
Work with me here.

595
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,493
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

596
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,827
I'm just...

597
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,289
[sighs]

598
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,958
I'm saying maybe something happened.

599
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,880
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

600
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,882
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

601
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,636
-It's a reach.
-It's a start.

602
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,263
[Callahan] Hey, Powell,
is the chief with you?

603
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,557
Hopper here.
What do you got?

604
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,861
[siren blaring]

605
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,185
[Eleven] Here.

606
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,813
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

607
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,439
Hiding.

608
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,151
No, no, this is where he lives.

609
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,236
He's missing from here.
Understand?

610
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,783
-[Lucas] What are we doing here?
-She said he's hiding here.

611
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,577
Um... no!

612
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,329
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing--

613
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,914
That's exactly what we did.

614
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,042
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

615
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,837
-Why did you bring us here?
-[stammers]

616
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,132
-Mike, don't waste your time with her.
-What do you want to do then?

617
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,800
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

618
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,468
-We are not calling the cops!
-[Dustin] Hey, guys?

619
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,762
-What other choice do we have?
-Guys!

620
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,598
[sirens approaching]

621
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,689
[Mike] Will...

622
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,955
[exhales]

623
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,000
Okay.

624
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,419
Okay, baby, talk to me.

625
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,212
Talk to me.
Where are you?

626
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,883
"R." Good, good, good, good.

627
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,343
That's good.
Come on, come on.

628
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,178
"I...

629
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,388
G...

630
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,140
H... T...

631
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,100
H...

632
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,185
E...

633
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,312
R... E..."

634
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,980
"Right here."

635
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,107
"Right here"?

636
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,860
[stammers] I don't know what that means.

637
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,237
I need you to tell me what to do.

638
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,322
What should I do?

639
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,659
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

640
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,588
[gasping]

641
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,341
[Joyce whimpers]

642
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,139
[monster screeching]

643
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,309
[sirens wailing]

644
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,144
[Hopper] Oh, Jesus.

645
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,943
[panting]

646
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,404
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

647
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,531
[indistinct radio chatter]

648
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,922
[breathing heavily]

649
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,351
It's not Will.
It can't be.

650
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,488
It's Will.
It's really Will.

651
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,412
[Eleven] Mike...

652
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,664
-"Mike"? "Mike," what?
-[gasps]

653
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,875
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

654
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,376
You said he was alive!

655
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,878
Why did you lie to us?

656
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,172
What's wrong with you?

657
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,007
What is wrong with you?

658
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,301
-[softly] Mike...
-What?

659
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,224
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

660
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,350
Mike...

661
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,103
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

662
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,275
[Lucas] Mike!

663
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,909
[shrieks]

664
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,287
-[Joyce gasps]
-[Jonathan] Mom?

665
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,250
-Mom, what happened?
-[Joyce whimpers]

666
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,584
[Jonathan] It's okay.

667
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,920
Hey.

668
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,510
[Karen] Michael?

669
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,471
What's wrong?

670
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,818
[sobbing]

671
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,834
