00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,150
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,821
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

11
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,865
-It is almost here.
-What is it?

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,283
What if it's the Demogorgon?

13
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,411
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

14
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,537
It's not the Demogorgon.

15
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,873
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

16
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,083
-Troglodytes?
-Told ya. [chuckling]

18
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,963
[softly] Wait a minute.

19
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,591
Did you hear that?

20
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,092
That... that sound?

21
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,845
Boom... boom...

22
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,680
-[yells] Boom!
-[slams table]

23
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,641
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

24
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,392
That came from something else.

25
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,855
-The Demogorgon!
-[all groaning]

26
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,398
-We're in deep shit.
-Will, your action!

27
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,775
-I don't know!
-Fireball him!

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,151
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

29
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,697
-Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
-Cast Protection.

31
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,492
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

32
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,369
It stomps towards you.

33
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,453
-Boom!
-Fireball him!

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,830
-Another stomp, boom!
-Cast Protection.

35
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,750
-He roars in anger!
-[all clamoring]

36
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,335
-Fireball!
-[die clattering]

37
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,045
-Oh, shit!
-[Lucas] Where'd it go?

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,838
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Will] I don't know!

39
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,465
-Is it a 13?
-[Will] I don't know!

40
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,716
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Dustin] Oh, my God!

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,385
[Karen] Mike!
[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,552
[Karen] Mike!
[Lucas] Can you find it yet?

43
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,720
[Will] No, I can't find it!

44
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,472
-Mike!
-[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

45
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,349
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

46
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,559
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

47
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,813
[Lucas] Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
[Will] Why do we have to go?

48
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,607
-Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
-It's a school night, Michael.

49
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,151
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

50
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,778
-But that'll ruin the flow!
-Michael--

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,113
I'm serious, Mom.

52
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,657
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,659
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

54
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,619
You've been playing for ten hours?

55
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,749
-Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
-I think you should listen to your mother.

56
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,294
-[static crackling on TV]
-[grunts] Dang dumb piece of junk.

57
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
[Will] Oh, I got it!

58
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,258
-Does the seven count?
-It was a seven?

59
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,469
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

60
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,267
[Dustin] Yo, hey, guys.

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,227
-Does anyone want this?
-[both] No.

62
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,857
[Nancy] Yeah.

63
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,234
No, I don't think...

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,945
Yeah, he's cute.

65
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,365
Barb, no, I don't think so.

66
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,908
-Barb, you're not--
-Hey, Nancy.

67
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,161
There's a slice left if you want it.

68
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,580
-Sausage and pepperoni!
-Hold on.

69
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,382
-There's something wrong with your sister.
-What are you talking about?

70
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,259
-She's got a stick up her butt.
-[Lucas] Yeah.

71
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,845
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

72
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,680
[Dustin] Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

73
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,098
She's always been a real jerk.

74
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,058
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

75
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,519
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

76
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,812
[Mike] Four years ago!

77
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,355
[Dustin] Just saying.
[Lucas] Later.

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,984
-It was a seven.
-Huh?

79
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,819
The roll, it was a seven.

80
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,114
The Demogorgon, it got me.

81
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,159
[grunts] See you tomorrow.

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,844
[Lucas] Good night, ladies.
[Dustin] Kiss your mom 'night for me.

83
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,264
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

84
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,016
-Any comic?
-Yeah.

85
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,019
[Dustin] Hey! Hey!

86
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,063
I didn't say "go"!

87
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,150
Get back here!

88
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,361
I'm gonna kill you!

89
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,863
[Will] I'll take your X-Men 134!

90
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,704

116
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,405
[woman on TV] And that's it
for News Center this morning.

117
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,823
Thanks for joining us.

118
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,201
Let's hand off now to Liz
at the news desk.

119
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
[Liz] All right, thank you, Donna.

120
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,870
Turning now to local news,

121
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,373
we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.

122
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,418
Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,

123
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,879
leaving many residents in the dark.

124
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,090
The cause of the outage is still unknown.

125
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,383
We reached out to Roane County
Water and Electric,

126
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,011
and a spokesperson says
that they are confident

127
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,680
power will be restored
to all remaining homes

128
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,307
within the next several hours.

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,142

In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight

140
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
or at least pack an umbrella.

141
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,581
We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.

[birds chirping]

143
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,087
[Joyce] Where the hell are they?

144
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,590
-Jonathan?
-Check the couch!

145
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,799
Ugh, I did.

146
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,386
Oh... Got them.

147
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,848
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

148
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,766
-Yeah, see you later.
-Where's Will?

149
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,934
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

150
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,144
-He's probably still sleeping.
-[sighs]

151
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,355
-Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
-Mom, I'm making breakfast.

152
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,274
I told you this a thousand times.

153
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,986
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

154
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,743
-He came home last night, right?
-He's not in his room?

155
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,120
-Did he come home or not?
-I don't know.

156
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,455
-You don't know?
-No.

157
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,582
[stammering] I got home late.
I was working.

158
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,708
You were working?

159
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,710
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

160
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,253
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

161
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,048
-Jonathan, we've talked about this.
-I know, I know.

162
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

163
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,302
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

164
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,055
-I'm sure he just stayed over.
-[sighs] I can't believe you.

165
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,724
I can't believe you sometimes.

166
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,272
-[phone ringing]
-That's disgusting.

167
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,566
-[Mike] You're disgusting!
-Hello?

168
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,401
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

169
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,528
-[Karen] Oh, Joyce, hi.
-What the hell, Mike?

170
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,780
-[Ted] Hey!
-Quiet!

-Language.
-Are you kidding?

172
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,033
Was that Will I heard back there?

173
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,618
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

174
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,119
Will didn't spend the night?

175
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,622
[Karen] No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.

176
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,040
Why? He's not home?

177
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,961
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

178
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,046
-Thank you so much. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

179
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,399
[school bell ringing]

180
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,904
That's weird.
I don't see him.

181
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,531
[Lucas] I'm telling you, his mom's right.

182
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,449
He probably just
went to class early again.

183
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,035
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

184
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,037
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,374
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

186
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,085
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

187
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,757
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

188
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,010
[sighs]

189
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,346
[mimicking Dustin]
I'd go with Toothless.

190
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,891
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

191
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,727
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

192
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
[mimicking Dustin]
"I told you a million times."

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
-[chuckles]
-Do the arm thing.

194
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,066
Do it, freak!

195
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,322
-[bones cracking]
-[both groaning]

196
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,658
[Troy] God, it gets me every time.

197
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,829
-Assholes.
-[Mike] I think it's kinda cool.

198
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,081
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

199
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,042
Like Mr. Fantastic.

200
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,377
[Dustin] Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

201
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,468
[bell ringing]

202
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
[Barbara] So, did he call?

203
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,140
Keep your voice down.

204
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,808
Did he?

205
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,643
I told you, it's not like that.

206
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,981
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,983
We just...

208
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,611
made out a couple times.

209
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,073
"We just... made out a couple times."

210
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,491
Nance, seriously,

211
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,659
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

212
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,161
No, I'm not.

213
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,915
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

214
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,793
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol--

215
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,169
Oh, that's gross!

216
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,421
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

217
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,341
-Two-time thing.
-[chuckles]

218
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,472
You were saying?

219
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,359
-Steve...
-Mmm-hmm?

220
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,111
-I have to go.
-In a minute.

221
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,487
[bell ringing]

222
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,864
Steve.
I really, like...

223
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,783
Seriously, I have to go.

224
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,243
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

225
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,203
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

226
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,206
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

227
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,542
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

228
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,335
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

229
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,587
-Well, then, just let me help.
-You failed chem.

230
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,673
-C-minus.
-Well, in that case...

231
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,092
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

232
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,137
-Are you crazy? My mom would not--
-I'll climb through your window.

233
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,389
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

234
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,723
You are crazy.

235
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,642
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

236
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,018
We can just...

237
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

238
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,065
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

239
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,569
Steve... I have to study.

240
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,362
I'm not kidding.

241
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,739
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

242
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,493
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

243
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,120
[sighs]

244
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,043
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

245
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,254
To study.

246
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,426
[bell ringing]

247
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,768
Good of you to show.

248
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,522
[Hopper slurring] Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

249
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,276
-Hey, Chief.
-Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

250
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,360
-Oh, yeah?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

251
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,988
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

252
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,072
[officers laughing]

253
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,699
While you were drinking or sleeping,

254
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,744
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

255
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
Phil Larson called.

256
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,581
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

257
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,124
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

258
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

259
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,086
On a more pressing matter,

260
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,214
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

261
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,050
[muffled] Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

262
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,344
-Just give me a minute.
-Joyce is very upset.

263
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,304
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

264
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,723
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

265
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,685
-Chief, she's already in your--
-Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

266
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,949
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

267
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,618
[sighs deeply] And I apologize again.

268
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,078
I'm going out of my mind!

269
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,748
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

270
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,833
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

271
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,460
-He wouldn't do that.
-Well, you never know.

272
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,254
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

273
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,922
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

274
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,674
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

275
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,718
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

276
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,304
He's not like... most.

277
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,267
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

278
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,185
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

279
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,312
-They laugh at him, his clothes--
-His clothes?

280
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,356
-What's wrong with his clothes?
-I don't know.

281
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,733
-Does that matter?
-Maybe.

282
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,861
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

283
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,657
Lonnie... [sighs]
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

284
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,075
[softy] Called him a fag.

285
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,079
-Is he?
-He's missing is what he is.

286
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,958
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

287
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,084
[scoffs]

288
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,423
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

289
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,259
-But he has nothing to do with this.
-Why don't you give me his number?

290
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,219
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

291
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,514
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

292
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,725
the kid is with a parent or relative.

293
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,310
[stammers] What about the other time?

294
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,730
-What?
-You said, "99 out of 100."

295
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,857
-What about the other time, the one?
-Joyce.

296
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,066
The one!

297
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,985
-Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
-[sighs]

298
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,820
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

299
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,988
in the four years I've been working here?

300
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,239
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

301
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,451
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

302
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,244
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

303
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,997
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

304
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,790
He will talk to me before he talks to--

305
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,834
-What, a pig?
-A cop!

306
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,921
[voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop.

307
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,882
Find him!

308
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,645
[man] Dr. Brenner.

309
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,273
[scientist] This way, gentlemen.

310
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,193
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

311
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,113
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

312
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,955
[air hissing]

313
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
[guns cocking]

314
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,930
[elevator humming]

315
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,065
[elevator thuds]

316
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,985
[squelching]

317
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
[low growling]

318
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,549
[indistinct growling]

319
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,930
[man 1] This is where it came from?
[man 2] Yes.

320
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,015
[man 1] And the girl?

321
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,769
She can't have gone far.

322
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,606
[growls]

323
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,432
[music playing faintly]

324
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,740
[Ben] All right, and one more.

325
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,618
[man] Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

326
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,245
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

327
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,664
[man] I don't know,
37 points per game average--

328
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,457
[Ben] Thirty-seven now, but...
[man] Mr. Basket.

329
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,063
[indistinct chatter]

330
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,114
Hey!

331
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,323
Come here!

332
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,367
Hey, come here!

333
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,082
You think you can steal from me, boy?

334
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,752
What in the hell?

335
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,132
-[bell ringing]
-[Mr. Clarke] Remember, finish chapter 12

336
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,011
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

337
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,221
and other forms of science investigation.

338
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,183
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

339
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,312
[trailing off] It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

340
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,356
So, did it come?

341
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,816
Sorry, boys.

342
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,776
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

343
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,903
it came.

344
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,491
Yes!

345
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,368
The Heathkit ham shack.

346
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,911
[Mike] Whoa.
[Mr. Clarke] Ain't she a beaut?

347
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,039
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

348
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,290
Think bigger.

349
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,375
-California?
-Bigger.

350
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,835
Australia?

351
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,379
-[boys exclaiming]
-[Lucas] Oh, man!

352
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,341
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

353
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,508
Lucas!

354
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,968
-Sorry.
-[Dustin chuckles]

356
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,931
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

357
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,726
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

358
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,479
[Lucas] What are you doing?

359
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,730
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Dustin,

360
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,816
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

361
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,069
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

362
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,154
-[Mike laughs]
-[knock on door]

363
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:12,076
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

364
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,829
[overlapping chatter]

365
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,624
Okay, okay, okay.

366
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,669
One at a time, all right?
You.

367
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,380
-You said he takes what?
-Mirkwood.

368
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,049
-Mirkwood?
-Yeah.

369
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,636
-Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
-I have not. That sounds made up to me.

370
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,513
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

371
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,474
-Well, The Hobbit.
-It doesn't matter.

372
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,393
-He asked!
-[mockingly] "He asked!"

373
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,061
-[Mike] Shut up, guys!
-Hey, hey, hey!

374
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,105
-What'd I just say?
-Shut up.

375
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,483
One at a damn time.
You.

376
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,778
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

377
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,238
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

378
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,824
-Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
-We can show you, if you want.

379
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,242
I said that I know it!

380
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,244
-We can help look.
-Yeah.

381
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,246
-No.
-[boys clamoring]

382
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,457
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

383
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,750
Immediately.

384
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,629
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

385
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,797
no nonsense.

386
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,841
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

387
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,719
-The Hobbit.
-Shut up!

388
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,178
-Hey!
-[Mike] Stop it!

389
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,388
[boys bickering]

390
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,390
[softly] Do I make myself clear?

391
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:26,150
Do I make myself... clear?

392
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,944
[Mike and Dustin] Yes, sir.
[Lucas] Yeah.

393
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,499
Ring-a-ding-ding!

394
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,293
Anybody home?

395
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,003
[Will] Password?

396
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,046
Uh, Rada...

397
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,884
[stammering] Radaga-- Radagast?

398
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,386
[Will] Yeah. You may enter.

399
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,930
[Joyce] Thank you, sir.

400
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,558
So, guess what?

401
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,102
I got off early and...

402
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,855
Ta-da!
Poltergeist.

403
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,482
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

404
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,941
I changed my mind.

405
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,819
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

406
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,405
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

407
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,490
Oh, yeah?

408
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,241
Not even of clowns?

409
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,409
No.

410
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,870
What about my witch?

411
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,371
-No. Mom...
-Ooh...

412
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,290
-I'm not five anymore.
-But Will Byers...

413
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,834
-I'm going to cook you up in my--
-Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

414
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,129
[sighs]

415
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,298
[Jonathan] Will?

416
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,966
-[shouting] Will?
-Will?

417
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,761
Will?

418
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,307
-Will?
-Will!

419
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,101
-[Jonathan] Will!
-Will?

420
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,728
[Joyce] Will!

421
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,480
Where are you?

422
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,074
Geez.

423
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,701
Your parents forget to feed you?

424
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,207
Is that why you ran away?

425
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,878
They, uh...

426
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,047
They hurt you?

427
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,635
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

428
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,387
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

429
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,641
All right.

430
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,855
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

431
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,940
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

432
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,109
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

433
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,445
We got a deal?

434
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,076
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

435
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,538
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

436
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,331
See? Like this. Here.

437
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,334
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

438
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

439
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,009
[sighing]

441
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,265
Eleven?

442
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,601
What's that mean?

443
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,228
What's it mean?

444
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,565
-No.
-Well, I'll be damned.

445
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,358
She speaks.

446
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,110
"No"? No, what?

447
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,907
[clicks tongue] All right.
I guess no more food, then.

448
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,158
Eleven.

449
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,577
Yeah.

450
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,455
What's it mean?

451
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,625
Eleven.

452
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,503
All right, then.

453
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,339
[chuckles] Here you go.

454
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,174
Take it easy, take it easy.

455
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,468
[sighs]

456
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,179
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

457
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

458
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,099
kidnapped or something.

459
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,187
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

460
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,733
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

-Hey! I got something.

471
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,291
-That his bike?
-Yeah, he must have crashed.

472
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,210
[Callahan] You think
he got hurt in the fall?

473
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,629
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

474
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,631
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

475
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,341
He would've walked it home.

Leave a message

Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

-[Jonathan] Yeah.

So...

515
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,377
maybe he came home.

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,504
[stammers] You think I didn't check
my own house?

517
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,381
I'm not saying that.

518
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,051
-Has this always been here?
-[Joyce] What? I don't know.

519
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,971
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

520
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,765
You're not sure?

521

523
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
Hey.

524
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,115
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

525
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,701
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

526
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,012

-[Callahan] Hey!
-Jesus!

529
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,992
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

530
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,537
-[exhales]
-What's going on?

531
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,831
Hello?

532
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,001
-Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
-Listen, I want you to call Flo.

533
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,419
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

534
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,631
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

535
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,008
[Callahan] Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

536
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,810
[Mike] We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

537
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says--

538
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,355
-I don't care what the chief said.
-Michael!

539
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,107
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

540
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,400
More reason to stay put.

541
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,527
-Mom!
-End of discussion.

542
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

543
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,162
-That's cool, right?
-No, not cool.

544
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,497
What? Why not?

545
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,792
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

546
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

547
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,797
-This is such bullshit.
-Language.

548
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,299
So we're under house arrest?

549
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,301
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

550
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,678
-Wait, this is Will's fault?
-Nancy, take that back.

551
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,305
-No!
-You're just pissed off

552
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,348
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

553
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,226
-Steve?
-Who is Steve?

554
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,729
-Her new boyfriend.
-You are such a douchebag, Mike!

555
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,606
-Language!
-[groans]

556
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,692
Nancy, come back.

557
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,777
Come back!

558
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,281
[sighs] It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

559
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,033
You see, Michael?

560
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,410
-You see what happens?
-[shouting] What happens when what?

561
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

562
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,207
That is really unfair, son.

563
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,500
We care.

564
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,297
[sighs]

565
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,174
-Mike!
-Let him go.

566
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,304
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

567
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,598
What did I do?

568
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,519
Hey! What'd I do?

569
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,608
[boy] Will!
[man 1] Will Byers!

570
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,734
[man 2] Will!

571
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,653
[woman] Will, we're here for you, bud!

572
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,529
[volunteers shouting indistinctly]

573
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,741
[Mr. Clarke] He's a good student.

574
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,244
-[Hopper] What?
-Will. He's a good student.

575
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,954
Great one, actually.

576
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,374
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

577
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,752
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

578
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,837
[Hopper] I always had
a distaste for science.

579
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,881
[Mr. Clarke] Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

580
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,300
[Hopper] Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

581
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,011
[Mr. Clarke chuckles] Ratliff?
You bet.

582
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,263
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

583
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,142
[Hopper] Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

584
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,269
Sarah, my daughter...

585
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,817
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

586
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,361
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

587
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,196
I never needed to look elsewhere.

588
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,490
[Mr. Clarke] Your daughter,
what grade is she?

589
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,368
-Maybe I'll get her in my class.
-No, she, uh...

590
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,995
She lives with her mom in the city.

591
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,541
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

592
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,629
-She died a few years back.
-Sorry?

593
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,964
His kid.

594
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,978
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

595
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,897
-Lucas?
-Hey, it's Lucas.

596
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,982
I know it's you.

597
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,235
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

598
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,945
I'm done. Over.

599
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,448
I'm worried about Will. Over.

600
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,575
[sighs] Yeah.

601
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,328
This is crazy. Over.

602
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,038
I was thinking...

603
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,376
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

604
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,461
He cast Fireball.

605
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,298
-Over.
-What's your point? Over.

606
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:43,094
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

607
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,054
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

608
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,264
Over.

609
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,478
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

[whispers] What are you doing here?

613
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,678
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

614
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,598
-I figured we'd just study here.
-No. No way.

615
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,934
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

616
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,811
So just... bear with me.

Smile looks good on you.

All right.
You just sit tight.

628
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,227
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

629
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,107
-[knocking continues]
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...

630
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,735
-Hey, can I help you?
-Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

631
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,071
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

632
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,907
-So try back tomorrow morning.
-Connie Frazier. Social Services.

633

Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

634
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,788
-That's a heck of a drive.
-Not too bad this time of night.

635
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,124
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

636
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,169
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

-Children I work with usually are.
-Right, right.

638
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,301
-So, where is she?
-Right. She's in the kitchen.

639
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,219
-Come on up. I'll introduce you.
-Thank you.

640

Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,668
That's weird, I... don't see them.

686
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,177
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

687
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,846
-get another notch on your belt.
-No. Nancy, no.

688
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,057
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

689
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,725
You mean, you're not a slut.

690
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,643
That's not what I'm saying.

691
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,479
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

692
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,230
Shut up.

693
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,485
Bad Steve.

694
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,113
[groans] Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

695
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,741
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

696
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,702
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

697
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,042
[Steve grunts]

698
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,711
"Compared to the rate
of inorganic reactions,

699
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,548
the rate of organic reactions
is generally..."

-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain falling]

701
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,596
[Joyce] Jonathan, wow.
You took these?

702
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,015
These are great.

703
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,103
[sniffling] Wow, they really are.

704
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,357
I know I haven't been there for you.
[stammers] I've been...

705
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,526
working so hard and I...

706
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,444
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

707
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,988
barely know what's going on with you.
[chuckles]

708
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,825
All right?
I am sorry about that.

709
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,202
[Jonathan sobs softly]

710
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,496
Hey, what is it?

711
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,748
What is it, honey?

712
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,919
-Nothing. [sniffles]
-Tell me. Tell me.

713
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,046
-Come on. You can...
-No.

714
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,297
It's just...

715
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,300
[voice breaking]
I should've been there for him.

716
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,387
[hoarsely] No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

717
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,682
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

718
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,435
He is... close.
I know it. [stammers] I...

719
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,814
I feel it in my heart.
[sniffles]

720
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,359
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

721
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,694
[sniffles]

722
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,780
-Yeah.
-Oh, look at this.

723
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,241
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

724
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,659
[both laugh]

725
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,745
-I mean, that's it, right?
-Yeah.

726
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,622
[hoarsely] That's it.
That's the one.

727
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,166

Lonnie?

731
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,800
-Dad?
-Hopper?

732
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,927
-[muffled breathing on phone]
-Who is this?

733
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,846
[breathing continues]

734
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,265
Will?

735
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,225
-Will?
-It's Will?

736
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,978
-[scrambled voice chitters]
-[static]

737
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,438
-[sobs]
-Mom, it's Will?

738
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,857
-[yelling] Who is this?
-[indistinct growling]

739
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,067
-[yelling] What have you done to my boy?
-What? What?

740
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,652
Give me back my son!

741
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,529

-[groans]
-Hello?

743
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,782
Hello, who is this?

744
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,619
-Hello? Who is this?
-[sobbing]

745
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,163
-Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?
-[muttering incoherently]

746
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,915
-[sobbing] It was him.
-Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

747
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,207
-Yes.
-What did he say?

748
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,418
[sobbing] He just breathed.
He just breathed.

749
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,462
-[Jonathan] And was someone else there?
-I...

750
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,256
-Mom, who was there? Who was it?
-It was him.

751
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,051
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

752
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,260
[sobbing]

753
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,720
-[thunder rumbling]
-[Mike] Will!

754
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,223
-Will!
-[Lucas] Byers!

755
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,060
[Dustin] I've got your X-Men 134!

756
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,896
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

757
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,230
[Lucas] Seriously, Dustin?

758
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,608
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

759
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,401
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

760
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,487
No, you're just being a big sissy!

761
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,491
[Dustin] Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

762
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,452
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

763
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,372
-And we have no weapons or anything?
-Dustin, shut up.

764
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,457
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

765
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,668
-Shut up. Shut up.
-[rustling]

766
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,419
Did you guys hear that?

767
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,880
