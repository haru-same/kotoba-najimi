[insects chirping]

2
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,899
[Joyce yelling] Let me out of here!

3
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,611
Somebody, please!

4
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,572
[grunts]

5
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,824
Let me out!

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,118
[door unlocking]

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,956
[Joyce breathing heavily]

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,638
[Dr. Brenner] Your son.

9
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,933
We know you've been in contact with him.

10
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,063
-[stammering] You have to let me--
-When...

11
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,775
and how did you make contact with him?

12
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,570
-What?
-Hmm?

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,864
Six.

14
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,242
What?

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,869
Six.

16
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,165
Six people have been taken this week.

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,795
This... thing that took your son...

18
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,841
[softly] we don't really understand it.

19
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,427
But its behavior is predictable.

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,597
Like all animals...

21
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,934
it eats.

22
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,187
It will take more sons.

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,273
More daughters.

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,942
I want to save them.

25
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,487
I want to save your son.

26
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,157
But I can't do that.

27
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,326
Not without your help.

28
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,619
Stop.

29
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,291
I know who you are.

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,835
I know what you've done.

31
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,131
You took my boy away from me!

32
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,968
You left him in that place to die!

33
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,054
You faked his death!

34
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,265
We had a funeral.

35
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,726
We buried him.

36
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,897
And now you're asking for my help?

37
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,569
Go to hell.

38
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,197
-[electricity crackling]
-[groaning]

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,119
-[breathing heavily]
-Okay, now what do you know?

40
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,788
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Did I stutter?

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,001
I told you.

43
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,461
Everything.

44
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,879
[electricity crackling]

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,133
What do you know?

46
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,718
[panting]

47
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,137
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

48
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,598
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

49
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,267
And I know you went
a little too far this time

50
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,269
and you messed up in a big way.

51
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,399
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

52
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,401
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

53
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,446
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,949
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

55
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,450
See, I told you.

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,121
-I know everything.
-All right, who are you working with?

57
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,415
Nobody.

58
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,667
But I did give all this
over to my friend at the Times.

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,460
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
[chuckles]

61
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,134
[grunting]

62
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,929
You're just a junkie.

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,725
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

64
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,060
Took one too many pills this time.

65
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,941
You made a mistake coming back here.

66
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,609
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,946
Here's what's gonna happen.

68
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,575
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...

69
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,870
you're gonna give us anything we need,

70
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,997
and we're gonna find her son.

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,793
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

72
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,004
Oh, is that right?

73
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,590
Yeah.

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,760
That's right.

75
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,484
Nancy? Jonathan?

76
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,490
[door closes]

77
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,451
-They're gone.
-What?

78
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,827
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

79
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,454
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

80
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,456
-[Lucas] Gross.
-No. No way!

81
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,624
Did they go with the chief?

82
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
I don't know.

83
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,418
No.

84
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,797
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

85
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,091
-Yes.
-Where? Where did they go?

86
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,221
Demogorgon.

87
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
[sighs]

88
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,872
Where's the girl?

89
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,208
[inhales deeply]

90
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,586
[exhales]

91
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,340
You gotta give me your word.

92
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,427
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,182
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

94
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,311
Then I'll tell you.

95
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,608
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

96
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,368
[sighs]

97
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,376
[gasps]

98
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,134
I don't understand.

99
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,886
We came to an agreement.

100
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,554
What?

101
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,182
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

102
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,684
we don't talk about.

103
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,977
You want Will back?

104
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,688
This place had nothing to do with it.

105
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,316
That's the deal.
You got it?

106
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,244
What is this?

107
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,163
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

108
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,624
[stutters] But my son's in there. He...

109
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,834
Put it on.

110
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,600
[Connie] I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

111
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,728
[Dr. Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

112
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,563
And if they find the boy?

113
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,231
That's not gonna happen.

114
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,882
[low growling]

115
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,997
[theme music playing]

116
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,947
[Joyce breathing heavily]

117
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,414
[Hopper] Hey, you all right?

118
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,540
[Joyce] Yeah.

119
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,292
[Hopper echoing]
I need you to relax, okay?

120
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,795
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

121
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,964
In and out.

122
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,758
Deep breath in...

123
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,844
and out.

124
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,472
In and out.

125
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,810
-In and out.
-It's troll's favorite food!

126
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,562
-[growling] Princess!
-No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

127
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,691
-Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!
-No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

128
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,027
[Hopper growling]

129
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,112
-[Sarah breathing heavily]
-Whoa, hey!

130
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey.

131
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,990
-[Sarah breathing heavily]
-You all right?

132
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,366
-What's going on?
-Whoa.

133
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,535
-What happened? What happened?
-I don't know. I don't know.

134
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,038
Hey, you all right?

135
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

136
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,249
-Relax, relax. Honey, honey.
-[panting]

137
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,251
Honey, just breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

138
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,046
In and out.
Slow, slow, slow.

139
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,714
[inhaling deeply]

140
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,633
In and out with me.

141
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,717
In...

142
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,763
-You okay?
-[breathing heavily] Yeah.

143
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,972
Yeah.

144
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,744
Remember...

145
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,580
-Straight into Will's room. And--
-Don't step on the trap.

146
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,082
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

147
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,625
Then...

148
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,586
All right.

149
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,505
You ready?

150
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,299
Ready.

151
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,511
[Jonathan] On three.

152
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,554
One...

153
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,224
two...

154
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,476
You don't have to do this--

155
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,560
Jonathan, stop talking.

156
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,812
-I'm just saying, you don't have to--
-Three.

157
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,524
[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.

158
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,900
We can't just wait around.

159
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,277
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

160
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,737
The bad men are still looking for us.

161
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,698
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

162
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,782
El can find them.

163
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,866
Mike, look at her.

164
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,619
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

165
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,289
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

166
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,166
That's the most important thing, remember?

167
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,168
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

168
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,671
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

169
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,049
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

170
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,510
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

171
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,679
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

172
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,014
[Mike] Are you serious?

173
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,765
El needs to be recharged!

174
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,144
[door opens]

175
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,855
[door shuts]

176
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,535
[faint creaking]

177
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,996
Did you hear that?

178
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,250
It's just the wind.

179
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,382
Don't worry.

180
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,802
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

181
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,970
Speak?

182
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,097
Blink.

183
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,266
Think of them as alarms.

184
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,818
Is that too tight?

185
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,196
[stutters] No, it's fine.

186
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,489
Thanks.

187
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,043
Nancy?

188
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,505
Yeah?

189
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,341
-[banging on door]
-[both gasp]

190
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,469
[Steve] Jonathan?

191
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,888
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

192
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,474
Listen, I just want to talk!

193
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,767
[banging on door continues]

194
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,187
-Steve, listen to me.
-Hey. Nancy, what--

195
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,689
-You need to leave.
-I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

196
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,941
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

197
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,361
[stammering] No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

198
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,113
I messed... I messed up.

199
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,197
Okay?

200
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,032
Really. Please.

201
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,659
I just want to make things right.

202
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,037
Okay? Please. Please...

203
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,164
[stammers]

204
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,541
Hey, what happened to your hand?

205
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,875
Is that blood?

206
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,710
Nothing.
[stutters] It was an accident.

207
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,671
-Yeah, what's going on?
-Nothing.

208
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,548
-Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
-No.

209
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,925
-Nancy, let me in!
-No. No! No, Steve!

210
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,970
-What is... What the...
-You need to get out of here.

211
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,847
-Whoa. What is all--
-Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

212
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,473
-I'm telling you, get out of here!
-What is that smell?

213
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,975
-Is that... is that gasoline?
-Steve, get out!

214
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,769
[stutters] Wait.
What? What is going on?

215
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,146
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

216
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,647
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

217
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,524
-I'm doing this for you.
-Nancy.

218
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,775
-Wait. Is this a... What is this?
-Nancy.

219
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,861
-Three. Two.
-No, no, no! No, no!

220
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,654
Nancy! The lights.

221
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,532
-It's here.
-[Steve] Wait, what's here?

222
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
-[Nancy] Where is it?
-Where is what? Whoa!

223
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,201
-Easy with that!
-Where is it?

224
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,369
I don't know.
I don't see it.

225
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,454
Where is what?

226
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,290
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going--

227
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,420
-[monster roars]
-[Jonathan] No!

228
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,922
Go! Go! Run! Go!

229
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,340
[Jonathan] Get out of here!

230
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,801
[growls]

231
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,387
[Jonathan] Jump!
[Steve] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

232
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,891
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

233
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,392
-What the hell was that?
-[both] Shut up!

234
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,227
[monster screeching]

235
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,354
[all panting]

236
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,318
[Nancy] What's it doing?

237
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,528
I don't know.

238
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,620
[electricity jolts]

239
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,585
Do you hear anything?

240
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,545
No.

241
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,838
[door opening]

242
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,229
[Joyce echoing] Will!

243
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,814
Will!

244
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,692
[breathing heavily]

245
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,612
Will!

246
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,702
Will!

247
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,001
[indistinct sobbing]

248
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,592
[Hopper] "I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know

249
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,552
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

250
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,429
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

251
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,638
I suppose I had, too,

252
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,725
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

253
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,685
And what does make roads red?

254
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,520
'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew.

255
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,231
It just makes me feel glad to be alive...

256
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,526
it's such an interesting world."

257
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,912

258
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,878
[Joyce yelling] Will!

259
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,633
[Hopper] Will!

[Steve muttering]

261
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,920
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

262
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,255
This is crazy! This is crazy!
This is crazy!

263
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,386
What are you do--
What are you doing? Are you insane?

264
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,637
It's going to come back!

265
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,472
So you need to leave.

266
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,432
Right now.

267
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,241

[Nancy] Where is it?

270
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,669
[Jonathan] Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

271
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,671
-You see it?
-No. Where--

272
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,839
Come on.

273
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,550
Where are you?
Come on!

[screeching continues faintly]

291
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,371
Get back! [grunting]

[all panting]

294
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,893
[Nancy] Where did it go?
[Jonathan] No.

295
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,394
It has to be dead.

296
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,647
[panting] It has to be.

297
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,324
[Hopper] Come on.

298
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
[Joyce] Is that my house?

299
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,377
[door creaking]

[Jonathan sighs]

302
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,235
[Hopper] It was hurt.

303
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,778
[Steve panting]

304
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,645
Mom.

305
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,647
[Jonathan echoing] Is that you?

306
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,192
Mom.

307
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,362
Jonathan?

308
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,951
[Hopper] Joyce, come on.

309
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,502
[crackling]

310
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,131
Where's it going?

311
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,551
I don't think that's the monster.

312
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,225
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

313
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,644
-I knew it.
-Yeah.

314
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,187
Always lying, saying she's out.

315
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,855
Bald-faced liar.

316
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,233
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

317
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,693
Okay!

318
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,987
Are you feeling any better?

319
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,157
[sighs]

320
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,409
What's "putting"?

321
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,119
[chuckles] Pudding, it's...

322
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,746
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

323
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,289
Don't worry,

324
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,583
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

325
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,293
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

326
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,545
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

327
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,130
She can make you whatever you like.

328
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,507
Eggos?

329
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,843
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

330
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,179
[sighs]

331
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,681
See, I was thinking,

332
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,017
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

333
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,603
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

334
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,397
Or you can take my room if you want,

335
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,024
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

336
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,235
My point is, they'll take care of you.

337
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,028
They'll be like your new parents,

338
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,864
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

339
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,742
Will you be like my brother?

340
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,537
What? No, no. [scoffs]

341
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,163
Why "no"?

342
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,623
Because... [sighs]

343
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,750
'cause it's different.

344
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,085
Why?

345
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,213
[sighs] I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

346
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,590
It's stupid.

347
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,884
Mike?

348
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,136
Yeah?

349
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,346
Friends don't lie.

350
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,640
[sighing] Well...

351
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,017
I was thinking...

352
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,311
I don't know...

353
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,149
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

354
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,192
-"Snow Ball"?
-It's this cheesy school dance,

355
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,987
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

356
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,781
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

357
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,576
-No?
-I mean...

358
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,786
you can, but it'd be really weird.

359
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,540
You go to school dances
with someone that, you know...

Breathe, Will, come on!

536
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,886
-[EKG monitor flatlining]

537

[sobbing]

538
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,265
[Joyce echoing]
Come back to me, breathe.

539
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,267
I need you to wake up now.

540
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,685
I need you to breathe.

541
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,312
Please breathe!

542
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,148
Please!

543
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,150
[Will gasps and coughs]

544
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,318
[Joyce] That's it.

545
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,530
-Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
-[coughing]

546
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,116
That's it, baby. Breathe.

547
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,327
Breathe. All right. Come on.

548
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,787
Come on.

549
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,956
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

550
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,749
Good, good, good, good.

551
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,919
Just breathe, Will, breathe.
[sobbing]

552
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,869
Michael?

553
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,122
Michael!

554
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,127
Michael?

555
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,341
[sobs] Oh, my God.

556
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,885
Oh, my God.

557
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,012
You're okay.

558
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,723
You're okay.

559
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,790
[EKG monitor beeping]

560
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,762
Hey.

561
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,639
-Hi, sweetheart.
-[Jonathan] Hey.

562
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,602
Where... where am I?

563
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,895
[Joyce sighs]

564
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,607
[Jonathan] You're home.
You're home now.

565
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,484
You're safe.

566
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,194
Jonathan.

567
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,906
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

568
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,785
[sighs] We missed you.

569
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,704
We really missed you.

570
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,248
Are you okay?

571
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,626
What, this?

572
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,837
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

573
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,758
You're worried about my hand.

574
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,052
[both chuckle softly]

575
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,430
[Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh...

576
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,140
We, uh...

577
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,434
We brought you some stuff...

578
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,104
so you don't get bored in here.

579
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,939
So... [sniffles]

580
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,986
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

581
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,489
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

582
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,562
[snoring]

583
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,246
Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

584
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,706
[Lucas and Dustin grunt]

585
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,041
[Mike] Guys, come on.

586
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,712
-[Mike] Byers!
-[Dustin laughs]

587
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,589
[Joyce] Be careful.
Be careful with him.

588
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,257
[Dustin] Move.
[Jonathan] Guys, guys.

589
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,092
-[Mike laughs]
-[Jonathan] Go easy on him.

590
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,678
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

591
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,388
-It was mental.
-[Lucas] You had a funeral.

592
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,307
-Jennifer Hayes was crying.
-And Troy peed himself.

593
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,059
-What?
-In front of the whole school!

594
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,185
-[Lucas] Yes!
-[coughing]

595
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,649
You okay?

596
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,735
It got me.

597
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,904
The Demogorgon.

598
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,447
We know.

599
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,531
It's okay.

600
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,991
It's dead.

601
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,201
We made a new friend.

602
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,245
She stopped it.
She saved us.

603
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,206
But she's gone now.

604
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,876
-Her name's Eleven.
-Like the number?

605
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,211
Well, we call her "El" for short.

606
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,378
She's basically a wizard.

607
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,630
[whispers] She has superpowers.

608
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,714
More like a Yoda.

609
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,341
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind,

610
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,592
and these agents
were trying to shoot us--

611
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,677
-Yeah, it flipped over us--
-Then she squeezed the brains out...

612
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,805
[Dustin] And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

613
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,223
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.

614
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,724
[Lucas] Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

615
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,768
-[Dustin] ...shot out of the wall...
-[continues indistinctly]

616
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,106
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.

617
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,441
Hungry for your blood.

618
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,359
It is almost here.

619
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,528
-What is it?
-It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

620
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,696
It's not the thessalhydra.

621
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,323
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

622
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,866
-[loud thud]
-The thessalhydra!

623
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,534
-Damn it.
-[Mike] It roars in anger!

624
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,328
-Will, your action!
-What should I do? I--

625
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,121
Fireball him!

626
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,292
Fireball the son of a bitch.

627
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,006
-Fourteen!
-[all exclaim]

628
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,926
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

629
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,011
It makes a painful...
[imitates screeching]

630
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,056
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

631
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,517
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

632
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,186
and, and, and...

633
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,687
and...

634
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,397
[all cheering]

635
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,196
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

636
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,281
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

637
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,575
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

638
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,243
and you present them to King Tristan.

639
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,703
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

640
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,748
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

641
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,124
No, there's a medal ceremony--

642
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,377
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

643
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,420
-And--
-The campaign was way too short.

644
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,047
-Yeah!
-It was ten hours!

645
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,131
But it doesn't make any sense.

646
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,676
-It makes sense.
-Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

647
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,219
And the proud princess?

648
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,637
And those weird flowers in the cave?

649
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,721
-I don't know, it's--
-[door opens]

650
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,973
[footsteps approaching]

651
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,140
Jeez, what's that smell?

652
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,892
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

653
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,435
[chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.

654
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,687
He farted.

655
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,105
-Dustin farted. [blows raspberry]
-[Dustin] Okay.

656
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,439
-[Lucas] Dustin farted.
-Very mature, Lucas.

657
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,565
-[Lucas blowing raspberry]
-[Dustin] Oh.

658
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,109
-Will.
-[Dustin] Shut up.

659
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,235
[Jonathan] Come on.
[Lucas] Dustin farted!

660
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,320
[Will] Bye, guys.
[Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will.

661
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,948
[Mike] See you, Will.

662
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,367
-[chuckles] Stop.
-No, you stop.

663
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,703
-[Dustin] No, you stop.
-[both grunting]

664
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,665
[Dustin] Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

665
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,959
[boys laughing]

666
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,636
-So, you have fun?
-Yeah.

667
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,762
[Karen] Hey, boys.

668
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:47,847
-Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
-Hi.

669
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,932
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

670
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,851
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

671
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,269
Merry Christmas.

672
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,938
-So, uh, you win?
-Yeah.

673
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,691
-Awesome.
-Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

674
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,905
-Uh...
-Merry Christmas.

675
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,657
Thanks, um...

676
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,160
I... I didn't get you anything.

677
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,162
-I... I feel bad.
-No.

678
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,166
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

679
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,378
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

680
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,055
Merry Christmas.

681
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,974
-You ready? Let's go.
-[Will] Yeah.

682
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,314
[sighs] All right. Buckle up.

683
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,653
Can I open it?

684
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,198
Yeah, sure.

685
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,285
Whoa.

686
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,369
Pretty cool.

687
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,580
[chuckles]

688
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,748
Yeah.

689
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,043
Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly]

690
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,589
[snoring]

691
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,267
Did you give it to him?

692
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,394
Yeah.

693
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,403
[indistinct chatter]

694
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,968
You leaving already, Chief?

695
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,346
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

696
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,764
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

697
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,851
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

698
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,185
[Powell chuckling]

699
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,688
Merry Christmas, Hop.

700
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,315
-Mmm.
-[chuckles]

701
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,175
[dog barking]

702
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,802
-[Jonathan] What you got there?
-[Christmas music playing]

703
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:14,929
That one of yours?

704
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,014
-Yeah.
-[Jonathan] Looks pretty big.

705
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,685
Be careful.
You'll break it.

706
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,901
What are you...
What are you doing?

707
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,402
[Jonathan] Documenting.

708
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,862
Oh, why?

709
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,322
-Because...
-[Joyce chuckles]

710
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,575
-It looks great.
-Oh, this is just so overcooked.

711
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,203
-And look, the potatoes are runny.
-Mom.

712
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,623
-They're so runny.
-[chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.

713
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,209
-It's definitely an Atari.
-An a-what-i?

714
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,585
The green present.
It's an Atari.

715
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,296
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

716
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,258
-Really? Well...
-[Will] Yeah.

717
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,009
We'll have to see, won't we?

718
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,638
Hey, no more snooping.

719
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,890
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

720
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,183
Okay.

721
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,311
-[softly] He's washing his hands?
-[chuckles]

722
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,403
[coughs]

723
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,030
[retches]

724
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,293
[groans]

725
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,353
-[Jonathan] Thanks.
-[both laughing]

726
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,733
Are you okay?

727
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,652
Yeah, I'm okay.

728
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,446
[Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom.

729
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,658
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

730
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,909
-Oh, yeah.
-No. What game?

731
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,287
I threw a fireball at him and...
[imitates explosion] dead.

732
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,664
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

733
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,249
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

734
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,084
-Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
-It's fun.

735
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,587
