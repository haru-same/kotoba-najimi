1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,259
[rain falling]

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,678
[thunder rumbling]

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,681
[breathing heavily]

4
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,767
[Mike] Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,936
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,229
[Lucas] Did you run away?

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,231
-Are you in some kind of trouble?
-Is that blood?

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,108
-Stop it! You're freaking her out!
-She's freaking me out!

9
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,401
I bet she's deaf.

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,571
Not deaf.

11
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,950
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

12
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,913
[thunder rumbles]

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,416
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

14
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,387
-No, no, no!
-[boys exclaiming]

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,097
[Dustin] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,433
See over there?
[stammers] That's the bathroom.

17
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,519
Privacy.
Get it?

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,910
You don't want it closed?

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,746
No.

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,915
Oh, so you can speak.

21
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,209
Okay, well...

22
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,297
Um, how about we just keep the door...

23
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,134
just like this.

24
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,345
-Is that better?
-Yes.

25
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,103
[Dustin] This is mental.
[Mike] At least she can talk.

26
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,064
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

27
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,858
She tried to get naked.

28
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,568
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

29
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,155
-Like, wrong in the head.
-She just went like...

30
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,698
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,409
-From where?
-The nuthouse in Kerley County.

32
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,119
-You got a lot of family there?
-Bite me.

33
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,204
Seriously though, think about it.

34
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,333
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

35
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,542
[Dustin] Why she went like...

36
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,420
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

37
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,505
-Like Michael Myers.
-[Lucas] Exactly!

38
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,174
We should've never brought her here.

39
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,592
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

40
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,428
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

41
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,221
-I think we should tell your mom.
-I second that.

42
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,265
-Who's crazy now?
-How is that crazy?

43
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,934
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

44
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,354
-So?
-So if I tell my mom

45
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,272
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

46
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,608
-Oh, man.
-Our houses become Alcatraz.

47
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,277
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

48
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,573
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

49
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,784
-You're letting a girl--
-Just listen!

50
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,827
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

51
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,954
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

52
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,831
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

53
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,167
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,377
We'll be totally in the clear.

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,253
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

56
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,714
And this time, we find Will.

57
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,346
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

58
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,723
[Dustin] You really think she's psycho?

59
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,392
Wouldn't want her in my house.

60
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,439
[sighs] Mental.

61
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,777
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,112
[door closes]

63
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,494
Is that real?

64
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,584
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

65
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,212
What's it mean?
Eleven?

66
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,675
That's your name?

67
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,846
Eleven. Okay.

68
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,266
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

69
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,561
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

70
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,024
Um, well, okay.

71
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,193
'Night, El.

72
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,739
'Night, Mike.

73
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,008
[door opens and closes]

74
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,890
[thunder rumbling]

75
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,529
[theme music playing]

76
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,815
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

77
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,693
-What? No, be careful of the poster.
-Yeah, okay. All right.

78
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,653
-I can't eat.
-I just need you to eat, Mom.

79
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,156
[sniffles] Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

80
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,658
-Yeah.
-And I don't want you to go alone...

81
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,826
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

82
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,328
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

83
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,789
-Okay.
-We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

84
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,999
-How much is a copy?
-Yeah, okay.

85
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,166
-Okay, Mom. Mom.
-Ten cents?

86
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,877
-[stammering] If we... Ten cents--
-Mom. Mom. Mom!

87
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,213
[stutters] You can't get like this, okay?

88
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,716
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

89
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,342
[knocking on door]

90
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,597
[sighs] We've been waiting six hours.

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,390
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

92
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,058
Six hours.

93
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,269
A little bit of trust here, all right?

94
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,314
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

95
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,065
-And?
-Nothing.

96
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,567
God.

97
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,654
Flo says you got a phone call?

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,906
Oh, yeah.

99
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,618
[Joyce sniffles]

100
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,832
[Hopper] Storm barbecued this pretty good.

101
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,335
-The storm?
-What else?

102
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,338
You're saying that that's not weird?

103
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,089
No, it's weird.

104
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,675
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the--

105
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,761
No, it doesn't work like that.

106
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,596
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

107
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,348
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

108
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,476
No. It was him.
It was Will.

109
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,522
[voice breaking] And he was scared.
And then something--

110
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,442
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

111
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,277
-Who would do that?
-Well, this thing's been on TV.

112
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,530
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

113
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,617
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

114
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,328
-Joyce.
-Come on, how about a little trust here?

115
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,623
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

116
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,166
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

117
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,710
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

118
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,089
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

119
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,799
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

120
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,103
[Joyce sniffles]

121
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,857
-You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
-No.

122
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,318
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

123
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,070
[Joyce sighs] Oh, come on!

124
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,239
You're wasting your time.

125
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,951
Hey, Hopper.

126
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,203
Hopper. [panting]

127
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,538
Let me go.

128
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,958
-I'm sorry?
-To Lonnie's.

129
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,919
[stammering] You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

130
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,422
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

131
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,215
He'll... He'll hide.

132
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,009
-You know, he's good at hiding.
-Yeah?

133
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,429
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

134
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,180
Stay here with your mom.

135
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,474
She needs you.

136
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,564
[engine starting]

137
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,483
[music playing faintly on TV]

138
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,829
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

139
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,166
Do a lot of studying last night?

140
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,835
Yeah, actually, I did.

141
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,296
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

142
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,091
Hey, what's going on?

143
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,594
[both] Nothing.

144
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,806
[radio static]

145
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,641
[footsteps approaching]

146
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,398
Hey, you found my supercomm.

147
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,649
Pretty cool, huh?

148
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,610
I talk to my friends with it.

149
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,570
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

150
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,738
Signal's pretty weak.

151
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,118
Got you breakfast.

152
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,664
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

153
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,083
but I just need you to go out there.

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,293
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

155
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,922
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

156
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,134
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

157
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,219
Understand?

158
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,721
Really, it's no big deal.

159
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,932
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

160
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,602
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

161
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,106
No.

162
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,525
No?

163
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,360
No.

164
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,781
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

165
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,122
You're in trouble, aren't you?

166
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,001
Who...

167
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,130
Who are you in trouble with?

168
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,425
Bad.

169
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,593
Bad?

170
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,762
Bad people?

171
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,476
They want to hurt you?

172
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,978
The bad people?

173
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,406

00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,465
[beeping continues]

348
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,929
-[beeping rapidly]
-[oozing]

349
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,106
Extraordinary.

350
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,401
[Mike grunts]

351
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,945
[mimicking Yoda] Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

352
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,322
[in normal voice] His name's Yoda.

353
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,533
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

354
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,951
Whoosh!

355
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,413
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

356
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,332
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

357
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,542
[Rory roaring]

358
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,384
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

359
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,804
We got first every year.

360
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,598
Except for last year when we got third.

361
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,767
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

362
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,871
You know Will?

363
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:16,043
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

364
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,754
[vehicle approaching]

365
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,717
We gotta go.

366
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,306
[Karen] I bought pizza
and macaroni.

367
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,933
[Holly] Okay.
[Karen] Okay.

368
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,564
Ted? Is that you?

369
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,856
Just me, Mom!

370
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,609
-Mike? What are you doing home?
-One second!

371
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,949
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

372
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,743
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

373
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,787
Do you understand?

374
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,455
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

375
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,915
Promise?

376
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,001
It means something that you can't break.

377
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,003
-Ever.
-[Karen] Michael?

378
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,671
Please?

379
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,339
[sighs]

380
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,597
[breathing heavily]

381
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,732
[Eleven echoing] Pop!

382
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,861
[sobbing]

383
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,279
[normal] Papa!

384
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,865
Papa!

385
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,283
No!

386
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,327
Papa!

387
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,746
No! No!
No!

388
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,873
[screams]

389
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,585
Papa!

390
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,337
-Papa!
-[banging on door]

391
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,838
Papa!

392
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,007
[sobbing] Papa!

393
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,258
[echoing] Papa!

394
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,718
[sobs]

395
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,888
Papa.

396
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,186
[sobbing]

397
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,900
I just... I don't feel good.

398
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,653
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

399
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,946
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

400
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,406
but the last time I told you I was sick

401
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,408
-you made me go to school anyway, and--
-Michael.

402
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,328
-Yeah?
-I'm not mad at you.

403
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,706
-No?
-No, of course not.

404
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,958
[sighs]

405
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,961
All this that's been going on with Will,

406
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,172
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

407
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,966
I just...

408
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,511
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

409
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,348
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

410
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,558
I'm here for you. Okay?

411
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,560
[thud]

412
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,312
Is there someone else here?

413
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,023
No.

414
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,527
Eleven?

415
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,195
Is everything okay?

416
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,321
El?

417
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,703
-[sobs] Mike.
-Is everything okay?

418
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,995
[inhales]

419
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,124
Are you sure?

420
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,793
Promise.

421
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,141
[dial tone]

422
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,612
[grunts]

423
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,451
[exhales]

424
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,332
[volunteer 1] Will Byers!
[volunteer 2] Will!

425
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,961
[Hopper] Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

426
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,255
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

427
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,591
[Callahan] Oh, hell, I could survive that.

428
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,675
[Hopper laughs]

429
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,802
[Callahan] What?
George Burness made the jump.

430
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,221
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

431
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,306
George is a liar.

432
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,267
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

433
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,853
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

434
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,149
Nah.

435
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,026
[Florence on radio] Chief, you copy?

436
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,112
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

437
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,948
Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.

438
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,867
I think you need to get there right away.

439
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,582
[indistinct radio chatter]

440
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,719
[siren wailing]

441
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,308
Ugh, Jesus!

442
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,643
[flies buzzing]

443
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,607
Suicide?

444
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,568
Mmm-hmm.

445
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,737
[Callahan] Missing kid, suicide...

446
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,532
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

447
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,994
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

448
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,249
Benny was my friend.

449
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,592
[music playing on car stereo]

450
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,240
[music playing on TV]

451
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,328
Hello?

452
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,538
[banging on door]

453
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,831
[Cynthia] Yeah.

454
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,253
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, is Lonnie around?

455
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,338
-Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
-To look around.

456
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,924
-Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
-I'll be fast.

457
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,342
[Jonathan] Hey, Will?

458
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,802
Will!

459
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,971
Will, you here?
Will!

460
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,809
[grunts]

461
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,102
Get off!

462
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,855
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

463
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,065
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

464
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,320
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

465
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,404
My oldest.

466
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,367
-Come here.
-Get off me, man.

467
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,170
[door closes]

468
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,841
-Are you out of your mind?
-Just listen to me.

469
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,718
-You are out of your mind!
-She knows about Will.

470
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,511
What do you mean she knows about Will?

471
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,682
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

472
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,643
-[Lucas] You could tell?
-Just think about it.

473
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,937
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

474
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,647
the same place where Will disappeared?

475
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,024
-That is weird.
-And she said bad people are after her.

476
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,402
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

477
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,864
-I think she knows what happened to him.
-Then why doesn't she tell us?

478
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,077
Do you know where he is?

479
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,161
[loudly] Do you know where Will is?

480
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,580
-Stop it, you're scaring her!
-She should be scared!

481
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,541
If you know where he is, tell us!

482
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,420
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

483
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,923
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

484
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,425
-What kind of danger?
-Her name is Eleven?

485
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,011
-El for short.
-Mike, what kind of danger?

486
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,721
Danger danger.

487
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,479
No, no, no!

488
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,315
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

489
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,995
No.

490
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,920
[Lonnie] Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

491
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,880
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

492
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,759
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

493
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,262
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

494
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,930
he's not here and he never has been.

495
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,017
-Then why didn't you call Mom back?
-I don't know, I just...

496
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,602
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

497
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,229
You know, he was lost or something.

498
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,566
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

499
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,777
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

500
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,195
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

501
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,409
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

502
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,453
Come out here to the city.

503
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,163
People are more real here, you know?

504
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,957
And then I could see you more.

505
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,587
-What, you think I don't want to see you?
-I know you don't.

506
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,714
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

507
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
She even know you're here?

508
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,135
Oh, great.

509
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,929
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

510
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,806
Some real fine parenting right there.

511
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,643
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

512
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,025
In case you forgot what he looks like.

513
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,364
[Cynthia] He's kinda cute, hmm?

514
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,491
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

515
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,495
[Earl] Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

516
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,458
You, uh, notice anything...

517
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,877
odd about him the last few weeks?

518
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,214
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

519
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,424
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

520
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,718
He got any enemies you might know about?

521
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,887
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

522
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,973
[sighs] The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

523
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,518
nah.

524
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,355
-When was the last time you saw him?
-Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

525
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,690
-Just you and the boys?
-Yep.

526
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,859
Me and Henry and... [sighs]

527
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,696
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

528
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,824
No kid did this.

529
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,826
Kid?

530
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,703
What are you talking about?

531
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:58,708
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

532
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,545
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

533
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,004
Can you imagine that?

534
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,008
This kid...

535
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,761
what'd he look like?

536
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,224
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

537
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,685
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

538
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,228
He look like this?

539
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,940
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

540
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,067
No. This was a different kid.

541
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,610
This one had really short hair.

542
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,779
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

543
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,490
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

544
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,660
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

545
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,120
could it be Lonnie's kid?

546
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,165
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

547
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,127
About the right height, though.

548
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,879
I mean, could've been.

549
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,631
Yeah, that's...

550
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,716
Could've been.

551
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,136
[sighs]

552
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,930
Because I don't want to go by myself.

553
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,184
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

554
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,645
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

555
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,607
No, tell them we're... studying.

556
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,400
[Karen] Nancy! Dinner!

557
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,194
Coming!

558
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,946
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

559
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,291
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

560
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,212
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

561
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,006
I don't know why.

562
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,966
[chuckles] Me, too.

563
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,512
-It's delicious, Mommy.
-Thank you, sweetie.

564
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,972
So, there's this...

565
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,558
special assembly thing tonight...

566
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,936
for Will at the school field.

567
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,020
Barb's driving.

568
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,272
Why am I just hearing about this?

569
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,191
I thought you knew.

570
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,361
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

571
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,781
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

572
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,908
I mean, everyone's going.

573
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,992
[sighs]

574
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,080
Just... be back by 10:00.

575
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,666
Why don't you take the boys, too?

576
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,959
-No!
-Mmm-mmm.

577
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,712
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

578
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,675
-[gasps]
-[Holly groans]

579
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,010
Sorry. Spasm.

580
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,141
-[Holly whimpers]
-Oh...

581
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,434
It's okay, Holly.

582
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,353
-It's just a loud noise.
-Nice.

583
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,357
-[sirens wailing]
-[people shouting] Will!

584
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,654
[volunteer] Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

585
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,875
[Callahan] Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

586
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,920
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

587
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,589
And stealing food from Benny?

588
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,341
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

589
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,051
Can't ask a corpse questions.

590
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,928
-[whistle blowing]
-[volunteer 2] Hold up!

591
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,471
You got something?

592
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,768
-Hey, what do you got?
-[Mr. Clarke] Not sure.

593
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,770
Maybe nothing.

594
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,772
I found this. In there.

595
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,654
[Powell] No way a kid
crawls through there.

596
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,407
[Hopper] I don't know...

597
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,867
a scared enough one might.

598
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,328
His brother said he was good at hiding.

599
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,436
[rhythmic beeping]

600
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,486
[radio static]

601
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,448
[Mike] El?

602
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,207
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

603
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,797
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

604
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,299
They promise.
Right?

605
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,927
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

606
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,304
[Dustin] Ow!

607
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:26,017
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

608
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,143
That's all.

609
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,145
We just wanted to find our friend.

610
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,772
"Friend"?

611
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,733
Yeah, friend.
Will?

612
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,112
What is "friend"?

613
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,613
Is she serious?

614
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,701
Um, a friend--

615
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,536
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

616
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,747
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

617
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,124
And they never break a promise.

618
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,126
-Especially when there's spit.
-Spit?

619
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,963
A spit swear means...
[spits] you never break your word.

620
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,464
It's a bond.

621
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,218
That's super important, because friends...

622
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,554
they tell each other things.

623
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,389
Things that parents don't know.

624
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,561
[music playing on car radio]

625
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,273
[Nancy] Barbara, pull over.
[Barbara] What?

626
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,649
Pull over!

627
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,237
What are we doing here?

628
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,905
His house is three blocks away.

629
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,449
We can't park in the driveway.

630
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,575
Are you serious?

631
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,784
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

632
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,579
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

633
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,497
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

634
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,125
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

635
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,460
We're gonna have a great time.

636
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,086
He just wants to get in your pants.

637
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,796
[chuckling] No, he doesn't.

638
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,174
Nance... seriously.

639
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,343
He invited you to his house.

640
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,345
His parents aren't home.

641
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,681
Come on, you are not this stupid.

642
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,767
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

643
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,936
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

644
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,898
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

645
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,942
-Gross.
-I'm serious!

646
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,319
All right, well...

647
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,573
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

648
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,117
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

649
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,202
Ugh.

650
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,748
Is that a new bra?

651
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,542
No.

652
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,837
[music playing in distance]

653
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,469
[doorbell rings]

654
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,973
Barb, chill.

655
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,267
I'm chill.

656
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,732
Hello, ladies.

657
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,746
[grunts]

658
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,307
[Sandra] What are you doing?

659
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,810
It's freezing.

660
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,067
You ever feel cursed?

661
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,574
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

662
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,952
the summer of '23.

663
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,914
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

664
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,672
When'd the last person freeze to death?

665
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,386
Hey, come back inside.

666
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,471
Warm me up. Just...

667
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,684
Just give me a minute out here.

668
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,730
[Sandra sighs]

669
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,129
[Lucas] What's the weirdo doing?

670
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,219
El?

671
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,901
Will.

672
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,569
Superpowers.

673
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,621
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

674
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,248
Do you know where he is?

675
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,849
[Mike] I don't understand.

676
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:18,935
Hiding.

677
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,687
Will is hiding?

678
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,026
From the bad men?

679
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,614
Then from who?

680
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,418
[sighs]

681
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,174
[camera shutter clicking]

682
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,804
Where are you?

683
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,605
[camera shutter clicking]

684
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,780
[camera shutter clicking]

685
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,031
-[woman screaming]
-[gasps]

686
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,826
[panting]

687
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,828
[screaming continues]

688
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,169
-[Carol shrieking]
-[Tommy] One! Two!

689
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,922
-Three!
-[Carol] Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

690
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,674
-[Tommy laughing]
-You're such an asshole, Tommy.

691
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,218
[rock music playing]

692
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:24,894
[exhales]

693
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,608
Is that supposed to impress me?

694
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,487
-You're not?
-You are a cliché, you do realize that?

695
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,613
You are a cliché.

696
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,116
What with your...
your grades and your band practice.

697
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,617
