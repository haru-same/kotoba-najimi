00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,760
[Jonathan] Nancy!

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,304
[panting] Nancy!

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,764
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,432
Nancy!

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,644
Where are you?

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,772
[Nancy echoing] Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,941
Jonathan!

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,361
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,196
Nancy!

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,532
[breathing heavily]

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,741
Nancy!

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,410
[Nancy] Jonathan, where are you?

13
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,121
Jonathan! [breathing heavily]

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,915
Jonathan!

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,125
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,044
-[faintly] Where are you?
-[panting]

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,754
-I'm right here!
-[Nancy] Jonathan!

18
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,215
I'm right here! Nancy!

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,511
-Just follow my voice!
-[panting] Jonathan!

20
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,847
[Jonathan in distance]
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

21
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,685
-[growling]
-[gasps]

22
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,186
Nancy!

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,230
[panting]

24
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,276
-[growling continues]
-[breathing heavily]

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,156
[squelching]

26
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,579
[growling continues]

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,134
Nancy?

28
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,721
Nancy.

29
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,851
[Jonathan in distance] Nancy!
Follow my voice!

30
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,563
[monster growling]

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
Nancy?

32
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,531
[Jonathan gasps]

33
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,283
-[Nancy] Jonathan!
-Nancy!

34
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,453
-[Nancy straining]
-[Jonathan grunting]

35
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,381
[Nancy sobbing]

36
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,509
[Jonathan panting] I got you.

37
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
[theme music playing]

38
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,255
[pop song playing on car stereo]

39
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,760
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

40
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,097
-She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
-That's... that's not it.

41
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,851
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

42
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,603
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

43
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,605
So what? [scoffs]
Like, you're worried about her?

44
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,109
-What?
-Aw, you are.

45
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,903
-Aw, Steve has a heart.
-Would you just-- Stop.

46
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,572
-Oh, Stevey's in love.
-Would you just shut up?

47
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,990
-Who knew?
-Shut up!

48
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,408
[chuckling] Jeez.

49
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,412
-[Carol] Damn. Sorry.
-[Tommy chuckles]

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,211
[sighs] So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

51
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,965
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.

52
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,331
[Joyce] Look, we gotta
go through this again.

53
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,209
-I told you everything that I saw.
-Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

54
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,628
-Upstairs or downstairs?
-Upstairs.

55
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,837
There was a laboratory.

56
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,507
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

57
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,633
[inhales deeply]

58
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,134
There was this kid's room.

59
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,888
-How do you know it was a kid's room?
-More like a prison.

60
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

61
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,850
Because, I told you,

62
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,645
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal--

63
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,355
[stammers] You didn't say
there was a drawing.

64
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,273
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

65
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,692
-It said "Eleven" on it.
-Was it good?

66
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,028
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

67
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,404
[sighs]

68
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,786
Wasn't Will.

69
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,963
Earl...

70
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,840
The night that Benny died,

71
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:46,221
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

72
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,058
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

73
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,935
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

74
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,354
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

75
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,523
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

76
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,025
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

77
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,486
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

78
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,699
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

79
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,450
I've been looking for Will...

80
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,495
I've been chasing after some other kid?

81
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,086
-[Jonathan gasps]
-[monster growling]

82
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,344
-[growling]
-[gasps]

83
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,265
[Jonathan] Nancy!

84
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,730
[monster growls]

85
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,243
Better?

86
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,204
Yeah.

87
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,084
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

88
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,713
I can go home.
[stammers] I just figured--

89
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,757
Yeah, no.
I... [stammers]

90
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,136
-I don't wanna be alone.
-[sighs]

91
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,265
-Do you?
-No. Uh... no.

92
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,851
[sighs]

93
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,219
Can you just come up here?

94
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,809
Yeah.

95
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,656
-Do you want the lights off, or--
-[softly] On.

96
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,158
[softly] Yeah.

97
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,372
You know, it...

98
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,208
it can't get us in here.

99
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,173
We don't know that.

100
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

101
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,703
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

102
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
Mmm-hmm.

103
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,335
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,588
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

105
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,673
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

106
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,724
Did you get it?

107
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,726
-I got it.
-Okay.

108
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,740
[grunting softly]

109
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,497
[pages rustling]

110
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,706
Oh...

111
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,792
Hey.

112
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,294
[Nancy] Hey.

113
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,506
[grunts] Couldn't sleep?

114
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,929
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

115
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,559
keep seeing that... thing.

116
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,063
Wherever I was, that place...

117
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,733
I think that it lives there.

118
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,652
It was feeding there.

119
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,780
Feeding on that deer.

120
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,242
That means that if...
[inhales deeply]

121
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,744
if Will and Barbara...

122
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,833
Hey.

123
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,586
My mom said she talked to Will.

124
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,006
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

125
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,091
That means that she's trapped...

126
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,510
in that place.

127
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,266
We have to find it again.

128
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,310
You wanna go back out there?

129
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,186
Maybe we don't have to.

130
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,565
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

131
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,776
-Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
-Right.

132
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,947
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

133
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,741
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

134
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,994
It's always alone, like...

135
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,121
like a bear.

136
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,541
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

137
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,211
-And then, last night, the deer...
-Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

138
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,504
One sec.

139
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,966
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

140
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,010
That's one drop of blood in a million,

141
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,346
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

142
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,098
So you're saying it can detect blood?

143
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,185
[softly] It's just a theory.

144
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,188
We could test it.

145
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,400
But if it works...

146
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,278
At least we'll know it's coming.

147
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,490
-[door knob rattles]
-[both gasp]

148
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,076
-[Nancy sighs]
-[Karen] Honey, are you up?

149
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,662
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

150
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,289
[Karen] I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

151
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,041
I'll be down in a second.

152
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,627
-[footsteps receding]
-[sighing]

153
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,004
[Jonathan sighing]

154
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,596
-[sighs]
-Your mom doesn't knock?

155
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,181
[both chuckle]

156
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,437
[knocking on door]

157
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,112
-Hi. Scott Clarke?
-Uh, yes.

158
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,239
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

159
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,490
-at Hawkins Middle?
-The very same.

160
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,825
Oh, wonderful.

161
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,412
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

162
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,414
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

163
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,417
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

164
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,918
Oh, that's neat.

165
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,586
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke--

166
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,296
Uh, please, call me Scott.

167
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,923
Scott.

168
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,927
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

169
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,013
and give them
the support and encouragement

170
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,098
to pursue careers in technology.

171
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,892
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

172
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

173
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,606
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

174
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,401
Oh, I have a few in mind.

175
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,873
[Mike sighs] I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

176
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,958
-[Dustin] She's gotta be close.
-She said it wasn't safe.

177
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,586
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

178
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,838
-She didn't betray us.
-Mike, calm down.

179
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,174
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

180
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,843
-Mike, this isn't your fault.
-Yeah, it's Lucas'.

181
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,011
It wasn't his fault, either.

182
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,222
-It wasn't his fault?
-No.

183
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,016
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

184
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,642
-Totally, but so were you!
-What?

185
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,394
-And so was Eleven.
-Oh, give me a break!

186
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,645
No, Mike, you give me a break!

187
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,190
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

188
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,816
I was the only reasonable one.

189
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,569
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

190
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,529
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

191
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,365
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

192
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,991
-You're shaking his hand!
-No, I'm not.

193
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,119
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

194
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,998
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

195
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,958
-No.
-Good.

196
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,587
Where are we going?

197
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,964
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

198
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,966
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

199
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,885

200
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,513
[breathing heavily]

201
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,652
Today is a very special day.

202
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,446
Do you know why?

203
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,202
Because today, we make history.

204
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,289
Today, we make contact.

205
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,126
[breathing heavily]

206
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,964

207

[birds chirping]

211
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,968
[Karen] Here you go.

212
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,095
Ah... yum.

213
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,515
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

214
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,643
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

215
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,937
[sighs] She is.

216
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,065
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

217
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,526
-Nancy, what's taking so long?
-[music playing faintly]

218
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,236
Nancy?

219
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,989
-[door knob rattles]
-[sighs] Nancy, come on.

220
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,992
-[sighs]
-[music continues]

221
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,170
Nan--

222
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,270
[doorbell rings]

223
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,155
What do you want?

224
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,287
[sighs] I drew first blood, so...

225
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,388
Okay, I'll shake.

226
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,306
On one condition.

227
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,433
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

228
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,935
-Then the deal's off.
-Fine!

229
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,728
-Fine!
-[Dustin] No, no, not fine!

230
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,105
Guys, seriously?

231
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,441
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

232
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,365
[sighs] We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

233
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,367
and those trolls took us out one by one.

234
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,161
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

235
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,123
So we stick together, no matter what!

236
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:07,128
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

237
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,132
-El is one of us now.
-Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

238
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,467
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor--

239
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,344
She was just trying to keep us safe!

240
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,971
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

241
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,264
An accident?

242
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,308
All right, accident or not...

243
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,435
-admit it, it was a little awesome.
-Awesome?

244
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,437
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

245
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,230
I could have been killed!

246
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,108
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

247
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,360
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

248
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,738
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

249
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,698
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

250
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,869
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

251
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,247
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

252
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,710
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

253
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,439
[upbeat music playing on PA]

254
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,197
[indistinct chatter]

255
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,497
[Dr. Brenner] It's okay, Eleven.

256
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,042
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

257
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,212
They're just here to watch.

258
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,091
Don't focus on them.

259
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,718
Stay in here, like before.

260
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,388
Yes, Papa.

261
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,854
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

262
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,525
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

263
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,736
It's reaching out to you...

264
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,656
'cause it wants you.

265
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,366
Hmm?

266
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,659
It's calling you...

267
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,495
so don't turn away from it this time.

268
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,914
I want you to find it.

269
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,083
Understand?

270
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,085
Yes.

271
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,746
[man] Are you lost?

272
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,542
Is your mom here?

273
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,212
Your dad?

00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,314
-What should we do?
-Uh...

276
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,776
Call the police.

277
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,824
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

278
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,618
-Hey! Stop right--
-[woman screams]

279
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,119
-Please.
-[woman grunts]

280
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,288
[stammers] You have to pay for those!

281
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,874

Can I help you?

284
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,612
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

285
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,657
-Who's asking?
-The Hawkins chief of police.

286
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,372
And you want to talk to my sister?

287
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,291
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

288
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,962
Okay, well, you can come in,

289
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,172
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

290
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,341
you're about five years too late.

[TV playing indistinctly]

292
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,804
Terry, you have some visitors.

293
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,433
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

294
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,562
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

295
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,023
Um, you see, uh, my son...

296
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,360
he's been missing for almost a week now,

297
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,613
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

298
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,323
about your daughter, Jane?

299
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:50,411
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

300
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,205
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

301
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,499
You guys keep in touch?

302
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,212
This is, uh... this is him.

303
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,756
[stammering] This is Will.

304
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,593
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

305
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,928
-Uh...
-What's wrong with her?

306
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,723
I told you, you're wasting your time.

307
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,927
[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.

308
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,889
-He should've shaken my hand.
-He's just jealous.

309
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,932
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,562
[sighs] Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

311
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,441
He's your best friend, right?

312
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:06,528
-Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
-It's fine. I get it.

313
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,115
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

314
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,533
But none of that matters.

315
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,286
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

316
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,705
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

317
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,666
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

318
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,251
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is. And you know it.

319
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,921
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

320
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,465
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

321
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,009
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

322
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,762
-Now everything's weird.
-He's not my best friend.

323
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,516
-[chuckles] Yeah, right.
-[sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.

324
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,018
-And so is Will.
-Can't have more than one best friend.

325
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,812
-Says who?
-Says logic.

326
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,482
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

327
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,526
Okay.

By the time Terry got involved,

338
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,149
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

339
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,775
Messed her up good.

340
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,194
This was the CIA that ran this?

341

You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

342
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,452
[sighing] They'd pay... you know,

343
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,496
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

344
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,250
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

345
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,129
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

346
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,047
-Isolation tanks?
-[Becky] Yeah.

347
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,175
These big bathtubs, basically,

348
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,886
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

349
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,638
You lose any sense of, uh...

350
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,517
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

351
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,896
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

352
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,355
Real hippie crap.

353
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,025
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

354
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,359
The thing is, though, is that

355
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,528
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

356
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,113
Jane.

357
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,449
[sighs]

358
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,994
Do you have any pictures of her?

359
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,082
I don't think you guys understand.

360
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,377
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

361
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,594
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

362
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,720
[sighs]

363
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,683
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

364
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,561
-like she's gonna come home someday.
-[lullaby plays from mobile]

365
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:49,107
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

366
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,985
Abilities?

367
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,863
[bones cracking]

368
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,657
You read any Stephen King?

369
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,408
-[hisses]
-[beeping]

370
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,452
[stammers]

371
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,870
[chuckles]

372
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,289
You guys look scared, actually.

373
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,209
[chuckles] I mean, it's all make-believe.

374
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,128
[clears throat]
What... what kind of abilities?

375
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,923
Telepathy, telekinesis...

376
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,633
[Eleven screams]

377
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,802
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

378
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,848
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

379
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,391
[yelling] Papa!

380
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,477
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

381
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:29,731
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

382
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,525
You know, to deal with the guilt.

383
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,570
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

384
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,948
[stammering] About having had the kid.

385
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,826
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

386
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,996
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

387
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,249
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

388
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,253
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

389
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,360
Oh, man.

390
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,904
[grunts]

391
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,375
[clattering]

392
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,121
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

393
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,006
What you kids doin' with all this?

394
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,424
Um...

395
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,305
-Monster hunting.
-Huh. [scoffs]

396
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,515
[cash register dings]

397
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,685
"Monster hunting"?

398
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,064
You know, last week...

399
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,985
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

400
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,903
It took me and Barb all weekend.

401
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,865
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now--

402
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,493
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

403
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,537
Yeah.

404
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,039
What's the weirdest part?

405
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,375
Me or the bear trap?

406
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,628
You.
It's definitely you.

407
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,130
[chuckles]

408
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,965
-[car horn honking]
-[Reed] Hey, Nance!

409
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,552
Can't wait to see your movie. [laughs]

410
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,012
What the hell was that?

411
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,806
I don't know.

412
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,561
What?

413
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,773
What?

414
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,442
Hey! Where are you going?

415
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,779
-[panting]
-Nancy, wait!

416
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,198
[whimpers]

417
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,659
Nancy!

418
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,210
[man 1] I can't believe it.
[man 2] These kids!

419
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,629
-[Jonathan] Jesus.
-[sighs]

420
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,051
Wow.

421
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,222
-[spray can hissing]
-[Tommy laughing]

422
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,349
[Jonathan] Wait!

423
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,017
[Carol] Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

424
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,061
[Tommy] Shut up!
[Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.

425
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,145
[Tommy speaks indistinctly]

426
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,732
[indistinct chatter]

427
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,025
[laughter]

428
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,111
Aw, hey there, princess!

429
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,781
[Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.

430
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,326
[Carol] Oh!
[Tommy] Damn!

431
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,744
What is wrong with you?

432
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,120
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

433
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,747
I was worried about you.

434
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,916
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you. [scoffs]

435
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,252
-What are you talking about?
-I wouldn't lie if I were you.

436
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,506
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

437
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,799
Speak of the devil.

438
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,134
Hi.

439
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,970
You came by last night?

440
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,557
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

441
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,394
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

442
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,855
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

443
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,525
Or for another
pervy photo session? [laughs]

444
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,151
-We were just--
-[Steve] You were just what?

445
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,820
Finish that sentence.

446
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,783
Finish the sentence.

447
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,577
[breathing heavily]

448
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,291
[scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.

449
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,502
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

450
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,129
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

451
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,755
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

452
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,841
a little screw-up like your father.

453
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,593
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

454
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,178
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

455
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,471
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

456
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,722
-Jonathan, leave it.
-I mean, your mom...

457
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,641
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

458
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,767
[Nancy] Steve, shut up!

459
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,852
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

460
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,728
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire--

461
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,855

Stop! Steve!
Knock it off, you guys!

467

-[Carol] Get off of him, seriously!
-Kick his ass, man!

468
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,161
-[Carol] Get off! Stop!
-[both continue grunting]

469
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,497
-Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
-Easy, easy!

470
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,333
Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

[both grunting]

472
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,756
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

473
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,800
-Jonathan, stop!
-[sirens wailing]

474
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,011
[Tommy] Cops!
[Nancy] Guys-- Jonathan, get off of him!

475
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,263
-Stop it!
-[Tommy] Cops! Come on!

476
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,265
-Stop it! Come on!
-Cops!

477
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,517
-You have to stop!
-Just go, Carol!

478
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,060
-[Nancy] Stop it!
-[both grunting]

479
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,770
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

480
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,606
-Kids! All right!
-Stop it!

[Callahan] Oh! My nose!

483
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,569
[Powell] Calm him down!

484
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,238
-[grunting]
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

485
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:14,201
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

486
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,869
-[Jonathan] Get off!
-I got this one!

487
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,872
[Callahan] Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

488
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,792

Good gift for a college student...

491
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,424
[continues indistinctly]

492
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,056
[Hopper] Well, thank you for your time.
We appreciate it.

493
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,266
[Becky] Hmm, yeah,
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

494
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,061
[door opens]

495
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,480
-Good luck.
-[Hopper] Thank you.

496
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,653
[sighing]

497
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,280
Hey...

498
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,908
[softly] What?

499
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,035
We're gonna find him.

500
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,249
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

501
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,126
We're close.

502
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,215
[breath trembling] Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her--

503
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,967
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

504
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,260
which means we've got a chance.

505
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,053
You know what I would give?

506
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,348
For a chance?

507
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,141
You know what I would give?

508
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,561
[Callahan over radio]
Hey, Chief, you there?

509
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,854
-Hey, Chief?
-Yeah, go ahead.

510
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,731
Yeah, a fight broke out here and--

511
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,026
-Cal, I don't have time for this.
-It's Jonathan Byers.

512
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,153
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

513
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,960
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

514
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,170
You, yes. Him, no.

515
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,506
He assaulted a police officer.

516
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,842
-[ice cubes clatter]
-Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

517
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,094
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

518
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,388
[chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.

519
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,974
I think you better tell him that.

520
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,726
What?

521
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,562
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

522
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,481
And that damn stupid.

523
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,609
[sighs]

524
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,325
Found some ice.

525
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,870
Thanks.

526
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,582
[sniffs]

527
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,379
[sighs]

528
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,968
Everything okay?

529
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,846
Yeah.

530
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,557
Everything's fine.

531
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,728
[sighs]

532
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,489
[Dustin shouting in the distance] El!

533
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,409
[Mike shouting] Eleven!

534
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,748
-Eleven! El!
-El!

535
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,626
Eleven!

536
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,919
Eleven!

537

[panting]

538
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,800
-Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
-What?

539
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,967
El!

540
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,011
El?

541
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,809
Hey, there, Frogface.

542
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,769
Toothless.

543
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,729
Shit! Run, Mike!

544
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,856
-What?
-Run! Come on!

545
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,109
[Troy] You're dead, Wheeler.

546
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,902
[Dustin] Move, Mike!

547
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,570
Mike, come on, run!

548
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,497
[beeping]

549
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,794
[beeping continues]

550
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,182
[beeping intensifies]

551
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,684

552
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,689
[panting]

553
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,733
[groans] Cramp!

554
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,485
-Just keep going!
-[grunts]

555
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,736
Keep going!

556
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,327
Shit!

557
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,206
-Stay back!
-Don't come any closer!

558
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,419
-[grunts]
-[scoffs] Nice throw, numbnuts.

560
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,672
[grunting]

561
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,424
-[gasps]
-Get off! Get off me!

562
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,384
Let him go! Let him go!

563
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,429
-Stay back, or I cut him!
-What do you want?

564
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,722
I want to know how you did it!

565
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,098
-How I did what?
-[Dustin whimpers]

566
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,475
I know you did something to me.

567
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,435
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

568
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,770
You mean piss your pants?

569
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,439
Our friend has superpowers,

570
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,942
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

571
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,401
-Shut up!
-[groaning]

572
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,821
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

573
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,614
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

574
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,533
Let him go.
Let him go!

575
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,827
I'll let him go, sure.

576
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,204
-But first... it's your turn.
-[panting]

577
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,413
My turn for what?

578
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,123
Wet yourself.

579
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,960
-What?
-Jump...

580
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,504
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

581
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,922
[Dustin] Stop! No!

582
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,924
[gasping]

583
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,719
I'll cut him right now!

584
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,138
[whimpering]

585
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,683
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

586
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,102
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

587
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,062
Mike, seriously, don't!

588
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,398
[breathing heavily]

589
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,832
[Dustin] Mike, don't do it!

590
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,751
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

591
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,712
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

592
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,172
[Dustin] Mike, don't!

593
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,885
-Dentist's office opens in five...
-[Dustin panting]

594
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,387
Four! Three!

595

-Two!
-Mike!

596
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,350
[Troy] One!

-[Mike screams]
-[gasps]

598
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,111
Holy shit.

599

[Mike gasping]

600
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,082

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

603
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,863
[Troy] She broke my arm! My arm!

604
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:49,989
Go.

605
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,910
[Troy] Let's get out of here! Let's go!
[James] Go!

606
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,912
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

607
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,123
She's our friend and she's crazy!

608
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,584
You come back here and she'll kill you!

609
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,630
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!

610
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,757
[echoing] She'll kill you, you hear me?

611
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,843

[Mike] El, are you okay?

620

El?

621
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,673
[sobbing] Mike... I'm sorry.

622
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,217
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

623
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,678
The gate...

624
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,975
I opened it.

625
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,064
I'm the monster.

626
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,151
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

627
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,819
You saved me.

628
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,781
Do you understand?
You saved me.

629
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:38,324
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.
