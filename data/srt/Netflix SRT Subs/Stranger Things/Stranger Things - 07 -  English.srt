1
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,970
[Mike sighs] That's better.

2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,230
You don't need it.

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,525
Still pretty?

4
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,402
Yeah!

5
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,363
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,703
El?

7
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,997
Yes?

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,252
[stammers] Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,837
Me, too.

10
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,971
-[door opens]
-Guys!

11
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,681
[panting] It's Lucas,
I think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,560
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,228
-[Mike] Yeah.
-What if he found it?

14
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,313
[Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio]

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,357
What's he saying?

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,484
I don't know, he's way out of range.

17
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,528
[Lucas] ...son of a bitch!

18
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,739
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.

19
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,409
Yes, I copy!
Do you?

20
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,244
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,371
Get out of there!
They know about Eleven!

22
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,957
The bad men are coming!
All of them!

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,710
Do you hear me?
The bad men are coming!

24
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,461
"Mad hen."
Does that mean anything to you?

25
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,879
Like a code name or something?

26
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,424
-[Lucas] The bad men are coming!
-"Bad men."

27
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,134
-Bad men!
-[radio static]

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,136
[gasps] Stay here.

29
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,730
[Mike] What's that guy doing?

30
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,732
You don't think...

31
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,986
Well, I know she and Steve
have been spending some time together,

32
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,237
-so I thought maybe--
-Mom!

33
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,114
[stammers] Well, is he home?

34
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,240
-Maybe you could ask him?
-Mom!

35
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,617
I'm sorry,
can you just hold on, please?

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,827
Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times--

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,829
-Did you schedule any repairs?
-What?

38
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,582
Is there anyone supposed to come
and do repairs on the house?

39
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,302
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong--

40
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,638
-No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
-[Dustin] Mike!

41
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,681
-One second.
-[yells] Mike!

42
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,685
We need to leave...
[panting] right now.

43
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,731
-[sighs]
-Michael!

44
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,610
If anyone asks where I am,
I've left the country.

45
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,778
What?

46
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,741
[Dustin grunts]

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,514
[Dustin] Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

48
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,187
-[engines starting]
-[tires screeching]

49
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,359
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,820
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-[Lucas on radio] Dustin!

51
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,780
Dustin, do you copy?

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,698
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

53
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,409
-Where are you?
-Cornwallis.

54
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,785
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

55
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,495
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

56
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,788
Okay.

57
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,214
-Shit!
-This way, come on!

58
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,552
-[indistinct singing]
-[bicycle bell ringing]

59
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,595
Out of the way!

60
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,305
-Out of the way!
-[ringing continues]

61
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,022
-[Mike] Lucas!
-Where are they?

62
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,399
-[stammers] I don't know.
-I think we lost them.

63
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,943
-[tires screeching]
-Go, go, go, go, go!

64
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,445
[Dustin yelling]

65
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,114
[Mike] Go, go, go, go, go!

66
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,533
-Faster, faster!
-Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

67
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,872
[yelling]

68
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,759
-[van crashing]
-[tires screeching]

69
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,127
Holy... holy shit!

70
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,588
Did... did you see
what she did to that van?

71
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,756
No, Dustin, we missed it.

72
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,342
-[stammering] I mean that was...
-[Lucas] Awesome.

73
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,344
[Lucas panting]

74
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,095
It was awesome.

75
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,815
Everything I said
about you being a traitor and stuff...

76
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,526
I was wrong.

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,364
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,078
Friends...

79
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,872
friends don't lie.

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,085
I'm sorry, too.

81
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,629
[Mike] Me, too.

82
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,894
[theme music playing]

83
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,137
Hey.

84
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,681
Jonathan?
Jesus, what... what happened?

85
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,933
-[Callahan] Ma'am...
-I'm fine.

86
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,476
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

87
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,686
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.

88
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,064
-Take them off.
-I am afraid I cannot do that.

89
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,232
-Take them off!
-You heard her. Take 'em off.

90
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:26,780
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

91
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,788
What is this?

92
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,456
Why don't you ask your son?
We found it in his car.

93
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,166
-What?
-Why are you going through my car?

94
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,043
Is that really the question
you should be asking right now?

95
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,212
I wanna see you in my office.

96
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,630
You won't believe me.

97
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,717
[softly] Why don't you give me a try?

98
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,513
Mike? Mike?

99
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,393
[sighs]

100
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,617
[doorbell rings]

101
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,828
Yeah, just a minute, please!

102
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,581
-[under breath] Jiminy Christmas.
-[doorbell continues ringing]

103
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,959
Hold your horses.

104
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,006
Mr. Wheeler?

105
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,716
Yes?

106
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,850
[men speaking indistinctly]

107
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,551
[Karen stuttering] I don't understand.

108
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,012
You think my son is hiding this girl?

109
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,221
What happened to her hair?

110
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,849
We just need to know
if you've seen her in the past week.

111
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,144
-No, no.
-Absolutely not.

112
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,937
Our son with a girl?

113
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,315
[chuckles] I mean, believe me,

114
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,735
if he had a girl sleeping in this house,
we'd know about it.

115
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,403
Wouldn't we?

116
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,488
[Karen sighs]

117
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,323
This girl...

118
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,449
what has she done?

119
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,284
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

120
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,660
-Oh, my God, is she Russian?
-[stammers]

121
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,872
-You can't treat us like this.
-I need you to stay calm.

122
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,665
You come into my house,

123
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,251
and you tell me that my son
is hiding some girl,

124
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,463
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

125
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,382
And you, what,
you expect me to remain, what, calm?

126
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,309
[sighs]

127
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,063
I understand how upsetting this is.

128
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,358
I wish we could tell you more...

129
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,739
but I can tell you that your son,
Michael, is in real danger.

130
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,660
We want to help him.

131
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,538
We will help him.
I give you my word.

132
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,500
But in order for me to do that...

133
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,920
you have to trust me.

134
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,049
Will you trust me?

135
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,014
Good.

136
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,266
Now...

137
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,645
do you have any idea
where your son might have gone?

138
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,986
[Lucas] This is Randolph Road, right here.

139
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,614
The fence starts here,
and goes all the way around.

140
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,659
And this is the lab right here.

141
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,202
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

142
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,328
It's gotta be.

143
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,289
[Dustin] Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

144
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,790
The sign says "Department of Energy."

145
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,001
Department of Energy?
What do you think that means?

146
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,044
It means government. Military.

147
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,297
-[Dustin] Then why does it say "Energy"?
-Just trust me, all right?

148
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,840
It's military. My dad's told me before.

149
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,675
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.

150
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,802
Do they make, like,
lightbulbs or something?

151
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,095
[Mike] No, weapons...

152
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,680
to fight the Russians,
and commies and stuff.

153
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,307
[Lucas] Weapons.

154
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,768
[gasps] Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

155
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,646
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.

156
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,772
Well, what do we do?

157
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,524
[Mike] I don't know,
but we can't go home.

158
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,026
We're fugitives now.

159
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,403
[helicopter approaching]

160
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,738
[stutters] Guys?

161
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,574
Do you hear that?

162
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,040
[Mike] Go, go, go, go!
[Dustin] Come on, come on!

163
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,791
-It's stuck.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

164
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,126
[Mike] Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
[Lucas] Come on!

165
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,628
[Dustin] Go, go, go, go, go, go!

166
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,171
[helicopter whirring]

167
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,506
-[panting]
-[Lucas] Get down!

168
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,804
[helicopter receding]

169
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,264
Mental.

170
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,186
[Joyce sighs]

171
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,190
You say blood draws this thing?

172
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,608
We don't know.

173
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,860
It's just a theory.

174
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,157
[Jonathan] I'm sorry, Mom.

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,243
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

176
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,120
-That is not good enough, Jonathan.
-I know.

177
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,623
That's not even close. That's not even
in the... in the ballpark.

178
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,291
I wanted to tell you, I just--

179
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,627
What if this thing took you, too?

180
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,005
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

181
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,550
[stammers] I thought I could save Will...
I still do.

182
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,011
This is not yours to fix alone.

183
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:46,933
[stammers] You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

184
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,142
You're not alone.

185
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,602
I know.

186
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,104
[sighs] God damn it, Jonathan.

187
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,898
-I know.
-Damn it.

188
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,858
[sniffling]

189
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,986
[Troy's mom] I want an apology!

190
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,237
[Callahan] An apology for what, exactly?

191
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,072
[Troy's mom] Where is the chief?
I want to speak to him

192
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,490
-right this instant.
-Stay here.

193
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,409
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

194
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,660
What is your name, Deputy?

195
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,537
Well, I'm an officer...
[chuckles] okay?

196
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,080
[Troy's mom] Name and badge number,
both of you!

197
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,040
-What the hell is going on here?
-[Powell] Chief...

198
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,084
These men are humiliating my son.

199
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,169
-No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
-Yes.

200
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,629
There was some kind of fight, Chief--

201
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,382
A psychotic child broke his arm!

202
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,719
-A little girl, Chief. A little one.
-That tone! Do you hear that tone?

203
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,053
Honestly,
I'm just trying to state a fact.

204
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,555
-I don't have time for this.
-It was a little girl--

205
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,224
Will you please take a statement...
[mouthing] and get her out?

206
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,475
-[Callahan] Yes.
-So what'd this girl look like?

207
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,729
She had no hair
and she was bleeding from her nose.

208
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,731
Like a freak.

209
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,940
What'd you just say?

210
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,151
I said she's a freak!

211
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,029
No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair?

212
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,031
Her head's shaved.

213
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,866
She doesn't even look like a girl.

214
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,285
And...

215
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,120
And what?

216
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,206
Tell the man, Troy.

217
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,877
She can...

218
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,422
do things.

219
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,799
What kind of things?

220
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:02,925
Like...

221
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,345
make you fly.

222
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,641
And piss yourself.

223
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,726
What?

224
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,312
Was she alone?

225
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,607
She always hangs out with those losers.

226
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,858
"Losers"?

227
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,486
What losers?

228
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,657
Hey.

229
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,285
You owe me $1.20.

230
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,414
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin
when we're done with him.

231
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,167
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,835
The cops should just lock him up forever.

233
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,505
-Did you see the look on his face?
-[Steve groans]

234
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,423
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

235
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,842
He probably had that same look
whenever he killed his brother, right?

236
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:49,430
Oh, God, I just got an image
of him making that face

237
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,848
-while he and Nancy are screwing.
-[chuckles]

238
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,767
Carol, for once in your life,
shut your damn mouth!

239
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,561
-What?
-Hey, what's your problem, man?

240
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,981
You're both assholes.
That's my problem.

241
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,400
-Are you serious right now, man?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

242
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,484
You shouldn't have done that.

243
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,860
-Done what?
-You know what.

244
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,821
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

245
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,156
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember
you asking me to stop.

246
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,908
I should've put that spray paint
right down your throat.

247
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,618
-What the hell, Steve?
-[Steve] You know,

248
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,787
neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her,

249
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,539
because she's not miserable like you two.

250
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,040
She actually cares about other people.

251
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,375
The slut with a heart of gold.

252
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,668
I told you to watch your mouth!

253
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,045
Hey! I don't know
what's gotten into you, man,

254
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,423
-but you don't talk to her that way.
-Get out of my face.

255
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,007
-Or what?
-[grunts]

256
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,175
Or what?

257
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,844
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

258
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,011
You gonna fight me now, too?

259
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,389
Because you couldn't take
Jonathan Byers...

260
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,226
so I wouldn't recommend that.

261
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,316
[car door opens]

262
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,402
-Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.
-[door slams]

263
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,280
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy!

264
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,866
Run away!
Just like you always do.

265
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,286
That Nancy's turning you
into a little pussy!

266
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,664
-[tires screeching]
-That's right, Harrington, run away!

267
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,375
Run away! [scoffs]

268
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,553
[Nancy] I have to go home.

269
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,138
No, you can't.

270
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,975
-My mom... my dad are there.
-They're gonna be okay.

271
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,520
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Let go.

272
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,230
-Let go!
-Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

273
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,773
The last thing in the world we need

274
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,567
is them knowing
you're mixed up in all this.

275
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,195
-Mike is over there--
-They haven't found him.

276
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,571
Not yet, at least.

277
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,323
[helicopter whirring]

278
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,909
-For Mike?
-Come on, get in the car.

279
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,372
Look, we need to find them
before they do.

280
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,790
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

281
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,668
-No, I don't.
-I need you to think.

282
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,462
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.

283
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,380
I mean, lately... [sighs]

284
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,632
Is there any place that your...

285
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,675
your parents don't know
about that he might go?

286
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,886
-[stuttering] I don't know.
-I might.

287
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,054
What?

288
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,141
I don't know where he is,
but I think I know how to ask him.

289
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,610
Whoa.

290
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,702
I got it.

291
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,627
[helicopter hovering]

292
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,256
[Nancy on radio] Mike,
are you there? Mike?

293
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,674
You guys hear that?

294
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,884
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

295
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,638
Mike, are you there?

296
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,390
Answer.

297
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,141
Mike, we need you to answer.

298
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,768
Is that your sister?

299
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,397
This is an emergency, Mike.

300
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,773
Do you copy?

301
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,442
Mike, do you copy?

302
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,069
Okay, this is really weird.

303
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
Don't answer.

304
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,823
-She said it was an emergency.
-What if it's a trick?

305
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,659
-It's your sister!
-What if the bad people kidnapped her?

306
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,620
-What if they're forcing her to say this?
-I need you to answer.

307
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,248
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.

308
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,083
We need to know
that you're there, Mike.

309
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,628
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.

310
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,714
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

311
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,841
Why is she with the chief?

312
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,217
How the hell does he know about...

313
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,221
[Hopper] We can protect you,
we can help you, but you gotta pick up.

314
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,932
Are you there?
Do you copy? Over.

315
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,936
[sighs]

316
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,858
Anybody got any other ideas?

317
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,944
[Mike] Yeah, I copy.

318
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,989
It's Mike.

319
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,407
I'm here.

320
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,036
We're here.

321
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,172
[Steve] Need a hand?

322
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,425
Did you have something
to do with this?

323
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,594
I just...

324
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,763
I wanna help.

325
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,481
All yours.

326
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,081
[sighs] They expect us
to just sit here like prisoners.

327
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,791
We should be out there looking for him.

328
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,669
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

329
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,546
This is our government.
They're on our side.

330
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,631
[Karen sighs]

331
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,550
That man gives me the creeps.

332
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,262
Nancy.

333
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,807
You don't think
she's involved in this, too, do you?

334
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,308
Nancy with Mike?

335
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,851
[chuckles] No.

336
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,938
-No.
-[sighs]

337
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,151
[Dustin breathing heavily]

338
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,784
Will you stop pacing?

339
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,828
It's been way too long.

340
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,831
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap

341
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,624
and the bad men
are coming to get us right now!

342
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,709
It's not a trap.

343
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,794
Why would the chief set us up?

344
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,046
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

345
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,506
Lando Calrissian.

346
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,258
Would you shut up about Lando?

347
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,260
I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this!

348
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,178
[shouting] When do you feel good
about anything?

349
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,306
[vehicles approaching]

350
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,233
[Dustin] Shit!

351
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,651
[Mike] Go, go, go, go.

352
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,613
[panting] Lando.

353
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,449
You think they saw us?

354
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,200
Both of you, shut up.

355
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,245
[grunts]

356
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,455
-[man 1] Hey!
-[blows landing]

357
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,831
[man 1 grunts]

358
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,249
[man 2] What the--
[grunting]

359
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,544
[door creaks]

360
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,924
[breathing heavily] All right, let's go.

361
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,260
Let's go!

362
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,786
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

363
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,667
I was so worried about you.

364
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,169
Yeah, uh... me, too.

365
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,884
Is that my dress?

366
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,558
Okay, so, in this example,
we're the acrobat.

367
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,561
Will and Barbara, and that monster,
they're this flea.

368
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,021
And this is the Upside Down,
where Will is hiding.

369
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,567
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

370
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,235
-A gate.
-That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

371
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,611
With our compasses.

372
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,825
Okay, so the gate
has a really strong electromagnetic field,

373
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,119
and that can change
the directions of a compass needle.

374
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,412
Is this gate underground?

375
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,163
[Eleven] Yes.

376
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,250
Near a large water tank?

377
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,127
Yes.

378
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,462
[stutters] How do you know all that?

379
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,632
He's seen it.

380
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,551
[Joyce] Is there any way that you could...

381
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,305
that you could reach Will?
That you could talk to him in this--

382
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,472
The Upside Down.

383
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,182
[whispering] Down. Yeah.

384
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,977
[Nancy] And my friend Barbara?

385
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,520
Can you find her, too?

386
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,443
[static]

387
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
[static increases]

388
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,717
[static becomes faint]

389
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,849
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,975
What?

391
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,186
[stuttering] What's wrong?
What happened?

392
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,938
[voice breaks] I can't find them.

393
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,798
[turns faucet off]

394
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,724
[Mike] Whenever she uses her powers,
she gets weak.

395
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,352
The more energy she uses,
the more tired she gets.

396
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,021
-Like, she flipped the van earlier.
-It was awesome.

397
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,399
-But she's drained.
-Like a bad battery.

398
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,360
Well... [stutters]
How do we make her better?

399
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,279
We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.

400
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,198
[Nancy] Well, how long?

401
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,658
I don't know.

402
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,992
[Eleven] The bath.

403
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,327
[Joyce] What?

404
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,623
I can find them.

405
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,167
In the bath.

406
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,463
[screaming]

407
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,549
[woman] Oh!

408
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,970
Oh. Oh, my...
No, mmm-mmm.

409
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,055
Hey, you know how they did that?
You know what that is?

410
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,390
[sighing] No, what?

411
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,017
Melted plastic
and microwaved bubble gum.

412
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,978
[woman] No way. Really?

413
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,604
Really.

414
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,273
[phone ringing]

415
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,067
-What in the world?
-Do you want me to pause it?

416
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,736
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

417
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,740
Hello?

418
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,616
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

419
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,578
Dustin? Is everything okay?

420
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,288
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

421
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,457
I have a science question.

422
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,918
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up--

423
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,963
Do you know anything
about sensory deprivation tanks?

424
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,840
Specifically how to build one?

425
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,885
Sensory deprivation?
[stutters] What is this for?

426
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,179
Fun.

427
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,930
Okay. Well...

428
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,184
Why don't we talk about it Monday?
After school, okay?

429
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,728
You always say
we should never stop being curious.

430
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,730
To always open any curiosity door we find.

431
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,856
Dustin--

432
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,567
Why are you keeping
this curiosity door locked?

433
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,111
[sighs]

434
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,404
Uh-huh.

435
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,198
[indistinct chatter over phone]

436
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,451
Uh-huh. How much?

437
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,411
Uh-huh.

438
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,499
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.

439
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,209
Definitely.
All right, Mr. Clarke.

440
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,503
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

441
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,962
Bye.

442
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,340
Do you still have that kiddie pool
we bobbed for apples in?

443
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,717
-I think so. Yeah.
-Yeah.

444
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,469
Good. Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.

445
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,262
How much is "lots"?

446
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,432
1,500 pounds.

447
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,227
Well, where are we gonna
get that much salt?

448
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,404
[Jonathan grunting]

449
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,326
Hey, wait.

450
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,370
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

451
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,539
[sighs] Worst case, no school.

452
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,333
Even if we find Will in there...

453
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,960
what are we gonna do about that thing?

454
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,336
We're not gonna do anything.

455
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,838
I don't want you
anywhere near this, all right?

456
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,340
-Your mom's been through enough already.
-He's my brother.

457
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,760
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him. All right?

458
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,387
You gotta trust me on this.

459
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,180
I am going to find him.

460
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,689
[grunting] This damn thing is heavy.

461
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,655
Come on.
It's upside down.

462
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,990
[Lucas] No, this way.

463
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,035
-Okay, um...
-How does this even work?

464
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,621
-Try that side.
-[grunts] Son of a bitch!

465
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,707
-Pull it back. Pull it back.
-I am!

466
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,418
-[Lucas] One, two, three.
-[grunts]

467
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,836
Shit!

468
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,470
[grunts] Ah.

469
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,638
[Nancy] Stand back.

470
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,105
Whoa.

471
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,825
[Nancy] What did she even eat?

472
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,536
-[Mike] What?
-Eleven.

473
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,874
[Mike] Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

474
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,210
She really likes Eggos.

475
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,505
[Nancy] I knew you
were acting weird. I just...

476
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,633
I thought it was because of Will.

477
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,594
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

478
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,096
Hey...

479
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,017
No more secrets, okay?

480
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,144
From now on we tell each other everything.

481
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,272
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

482
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,316
What? No.

483
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,070
No, it's... it's not...
it's not like that.

484
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,906
Do you like Eleven?

485
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,326
What? No. Ew. Gross.

486
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,509
This will keep it dark for you.

487
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,678
Just like in your bathtub.

488
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,722
[sighs]

489
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,516
You're a very brave girl.

490
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,393
You know that, don't you?

491
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,398
Everything you're doing
for my boy... for Will...

492
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,484
for my family...

493
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,528
[sighs]

494
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,738
[sniffs] Thank you.

495
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,576
Listen.

496
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,956
I am gonna be there
with you the whole time.

497
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,000
And if it ever gets too scary...

498
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:57,462
[stutters] in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

499
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,550
Yes.

500
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,262
Ready?

501
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,307
[breath trembling]

502
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,226
Ready.

503
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,203
Colder!

504
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,457
Warmer!

505
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,252
Right there!

506
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,454
[static]

507
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,474
[sighs]

508
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,369
[electricity surging]

509
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,014
[breathing heavily]

510
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,141
Barb?

511
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,476
Barbara?

512
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,063
[breathing heavily]

513
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,955
[squelching]

514
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,919
[bubbling]

515
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,920
[gasps]

516
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,463
[breathing heavily]

517
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,923
[electricity pulsating]

518
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,884
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

519
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,888
Is Barb okay?
Is she okay?

520
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,973
[screaming] Gone! Gone!

521
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,808
Gone!

522
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,561
Gone! Gone!

523
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,939
Gone. Gone.

524
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,524
-[crying]
-[Eleven] Gone.

525
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,400
[Joyce] It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

526
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,778
-[Eleven] Gone. Gone!
