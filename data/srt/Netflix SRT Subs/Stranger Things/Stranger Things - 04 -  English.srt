is that Will...

made his way over the quarry and, uh...

00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,105

so he could talk to me.

It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

36
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,470
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

I didn't know what was real.

45

And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

And I had to pack all that away.

00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,512
We'll be okay.

181
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,266
My mom...

182
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,980
she's tough. [chuckles]

183
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,564
Yeah, she is.

184
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,485
Hey.

185
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,279
She is.

186
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,492
[coroner] Ma'am!

187
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,119
-Ma'am, I need you to sign!
-I don't...

188
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,998
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

189
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,833
-Joyce, wait a second.
-No!

190
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,043
-Mom!
-[coroner] Ma'am, I-- Ma'am!

191
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,381
-[school bell ringing]
-[indistinct chatter]

192
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,342
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

193
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,802
To look for Barb.

194
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,971
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

195
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,681
That's crazy.

196
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

197
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,311
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

198
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,063
just hanging out in my yard?

199
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,898
I don't think it was a mask.

200
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,775
But he had no face?

201
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,778
I don't know!

202
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,739
I don't know, I just...

203
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,408
I have a terrible feeling about this.

204
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,534
Oh, this is bad.

205
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,161
This is really bad.

206
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,287
What?

207
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,247
The cops...

208
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,083
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

209
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

210
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,714
-So?
-My parents are gonna murder me!

211
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,759
Are you serious right now?

212
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,927
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

213
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,514
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

214
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,934
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

215
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,936
don't mention the beers.

216
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,813
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

217
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,024
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

218
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,069
[scoffs] I can't believe you right now.

219
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,155
-I can't believe you.
-Nancy.

220
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,158
Nancy, wait!

221
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,078
Nancy!

222
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,039
-[Jonathan] Mom, will you get in?
-No, I...

223
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,541
[stammers] I need to think.
Just go on home.

224
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,585
Mom, will you just get in, please?

225
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,881
Mom.

226
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,717
Mom!

227
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,179
Mom.

228
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,640
-Stop.
-Just go home, Jonathan.

229
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,476
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

230
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,978
-Shut down? What...
-We have to deal with this, Mom.

231
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,772
We have to deal with the funeral!

232
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,315
The funeral?

233
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,318
For... for who?
[loudly] For that thing back there?

234
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,445
Okay, let me get this straight.

235
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,698
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

236
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,617
And there's a monster in the wall?

237
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,202
Do you even hear yourself?

238
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,205
I know it sounds crazy.

239
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,623
[stammers] I sound crazy!

240
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,500
-Yeah.
-You think I don't know that?

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,751
It is crazy!

242
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

243
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,422
He talked to me!

244
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,341
Will is... is calling to me!

245
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,303
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

246
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,347
I don't care if anyone believes me!

247
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,018
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

248
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,188
[shouting] I am going to bring him home!

249
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,066
[yelling] Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

250
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,652
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

251
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

252
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,032
[Jonathan panting]

253
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,202
All right, show's over.

254
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,247
What?

255
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,175
-[radio frequencies tuning]
-[indistinct whimpering]

256
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,346
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

257
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,849
[Lucas] Yeah, I heard a baby.

258
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,975
What?

259
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,853
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

260
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,521
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

261
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,398
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

262
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,774
-That was Will!
-Mike...

263
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,068
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

264
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,361
Words!

265
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,198
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

266
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,492
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess--

267
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,826
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

268
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,911
I don't think it's about that.

269
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,664
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

270
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,417
-Like... like Professor X.
-Yeah.

271
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,169
Are you actually believing this crap?

272
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,129
I don't know, I mean...

273
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,049
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

274
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,343
He sounded a lot like that.

275
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,471
Did you guys not see what I saw?

276
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,806
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

277
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,433
He's dead!

278
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

279
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,981
-It's not his ghost.
-So how do you know that?

280
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,733
-I just do!
-Then what was in that water?

281
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,901
I don't know!

282
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,195
All I know is Will is alive.

283
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,738
Will is alive!

284
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,156
He's out there somewhere.

285
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,866
All we have to do is find him.

286
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,704
[static crackling on radio]

287
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,999
This isn't gonna work.

288
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

289
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,046
-Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
-Yeah.

290
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,172
The Heathkit's at school.

291
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

292
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,471
I mean... look at her.

293
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,559
Wow.

294
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,686
-She looks--
-Pretty.

295
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,106
Good.

296
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,482
You look pretty good.

297
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,000
[whispers] Pretty.

298
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,961
Good.

299
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,840
Clear.

300
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,472
-You boys hear me all right in there?
-Loud and clear, Shepard.

301
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,266
Good luck in there, son.

302
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,646
[low growling]

303
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,884
[monster growling]

304
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

305
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,416
bearing us down towards the sea

306
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,252
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

307
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,006
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too--"

308
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,550
Nancy Wheeler?

309
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,510
If you'll come with me, please?

310
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,935
[Powell] This argument
you and Barbara had?

311
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,645
What exactly was it about?

312
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,858
[Nancy] It wasn't really an argument.

313
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,819
Barb just wanted to leave.

314
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,030
I didn't, so, I...

315
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,658
I told her to just go home.

316
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,869
Then what?

317
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,665
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

318
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,627
And the next day, you went back and...

319
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,128
saw a bear, you're thinking?

320
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,841
I don't know what it was, but...

321
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,134
I think...

322
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,222
I think maybe it took Barb.

323
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,599
-You need to check behind Steve's house--
-We did.

324
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,017
There's nothing there.

325
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,770
-There's no sign of a bear.
-And no car.

326
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,021
-What?
-[Callahan] Look.

327
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,357
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

328
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,567
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

329
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

330
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,363
Leaving town, maybe?

331
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,572
No.

332
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,866
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

333
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,328
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

334
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,622
Uh, Steve Harrington?

335
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,332
What? No!

336
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,585
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

337
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,753
It wasn't like that.

338
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,963
Like what?

339
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,924
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

340
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,759
We... we just talked.

341
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,888
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

342
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,853
[Hopper] So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

343
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,147
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

344
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,482
They're all Staties?

345
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,567
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,695
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

347
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,573
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

348
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,575
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

349
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,661
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

350
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,580
Considering what?

351
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,791
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,086

00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,427
-Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
-Sure thing.

355
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,054
...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty

356
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,683
and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.

357
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,269
[reporter] State trooper David O'Bannon,
thank you so much for your help.

358
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,937
[O'Bannon] Thank you, sir.
[reporter] Back to you...

359
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,836
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

360
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,588
[man on PA] Attention students,

361
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:47,343
there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.

362
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,261
Do not go to fourth period.

363
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,512
It's locked.

364
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,765
-What?
-Hey, do you think you can open it?

365
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,558
With your powers?

366
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,101
Boys?

367
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,186
[Lucas] Hey.

368
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,771
Assembly's about to start.

369
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,607
We know.
We're just, you know...

370
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,484
Upset.

371
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,860
[stammers] Yeah, definitely upset.

372
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,403
We need some alone time.

373
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,656
-To cry.
-[Mr. Clarke] Yeah, listen...

374
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,990
I get it. I do.

375
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,077
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

376
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,578
And then...

377
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

378
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,085
What do you say?

379
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,671
[stammers] I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

380
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,424
-Eleven--
-Eleanor! She's my, uh--

381
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,592
-Cousin.
-Second cousin.

382
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,886
[Mike sighs]
She's here for Will's funeral.

383
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,222
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

384
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,349
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

385
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,475
Thank you.

386
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,144
Uh, where are you from exactly?

387
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,605
Bad place--

388
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,399
-Sweden!
-I have a lot of Swedish family.

389
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,900
-[Dustin] She hates it there.
-Cold!

390
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,569
Subzero.

391
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,114
-Shall we?
-Yep!

392
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,908
[principal] At times like these...

393
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,829
it is important that we come together
as a community.

394
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,123
-We come--
-[door bangs]

395
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,627
Abort.

396
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,215
We come together to heal...

397
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,843
we come together to grieve...

398
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,888
-You lied to the police!
-I didn't lie!

399
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,224
[shouting] How naive do you think I am?

400
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,435
You and Steve were just talking?

401
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,769
[shouting] We slept together!

402
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,105
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

403
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,525
-It does matter!
-No! It is all bullshit!

404
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,819
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

405
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,779
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

406
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,781
I know it!

407
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,908
And no one is listening to me!

408
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,535
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

409
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,329
-I'm listening to you--
-No! You're not!

410
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,415
Nancy... Nancy!

411
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,208
Just leave me alone!

412
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,543
[sighs]

413
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,593
[crying]

414
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,161
[gasps softly]

415
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,220
[devices beeping]

416
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,848
Try him again.

417
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,559
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

418
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,143
[static crackling on radio]

419
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,230
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

420
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,023
[static crackling]

421
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,651
[Shepard on radio] This is Shepard.
Confirming, over.

422
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,529
Shepard.
Where are you?

423
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,032
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

424
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,994
[Shepard] It's low visibility.
I'm about one click south of the rift.

425
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,581
Everything's still here, 
but it's all eroded. Covered in blood...

426
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,957
[indistinct growling on radio]

427
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,084
Shepard? Do you copy?

428
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,003
[Shepard breathing heavily]

429
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,338
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

430
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,049
[Shepard] There's something else...
There's something else in here!

431
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,593
[monster growling on radio]

432
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,928
-[siren blaring]
-Reel him in.

433
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,056
-[yelling] Reel him back in!
-[man] Get him in.

434
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,516
Come on, come on!
Faster!

435
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,101
[Shepard] There's something else in here!

436
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,228
Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!

437
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,522
-Pull me out! Pull me out!
-[monster growling]

438
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,572
[men shouting indistinctly]

439
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,087
[man 1] Shepard, come in. Over.
[man 2] Comms are down, sir.

440
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,756
[man 1] Shepard, come in!
Over.

441
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,407
[monster growling]

442
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,122
[principal] Will Byers' death
is an unimaginable tragedy.

443
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:14,670
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

444
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:20,259
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

445
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,637
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

446
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,390
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

447
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,101
But before she comes up here,

448
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,355
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

449
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,606
Look at these fakers.

450
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,442
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

451
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,152
-[Troy chuckling]
-[laughs] What?

452
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,947
[Troy] Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

453
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,491
-Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
-[chuckling]

454
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,743
[Troy mocking] Oh,
he was such a great student.

455
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:51,123
[mock crying] Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

456
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,791
[Eleven] Mouth breather.

457
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,295
[indistinct mocking continues]

458
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,718
[school bell ringing]

459
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,513
[indistinct chatter]

460
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,976
Hey! Hey!

461
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,311
Hey, Troy!

462
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,562
Hey, Troy!

463
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,607
You... you think this is funny?

464
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,109
What'd you say, Wheeler?

465
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,737
[stammers] I saw you guys
laughing over there.

466
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

467
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,074
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

468
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,784
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

469
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,872
[Troy] Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

470
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,915
Will's in fairyland now, right?

471
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,960
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

472
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,545
All happy and gay!

473
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,839
[Troy imitating fairy]

474
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,058
-[Troy grunts]
-[all exclaiming]

475
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,144
[Troy] You're dead, Wheeler!

476
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,937
Dead!

477
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,901
[indistinct murmuring]

478
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,658
[laughs] Dude, Troy peed himself.

479
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,243
[all laughing]

480
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,039
[giggles]

481
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,874
[panting]

482
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,502
[Dustin] Holy shit!

483
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,092
Hey! What's going on here?

484
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,259
Oh.

485
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,428
Mike! Let's go!

486
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,482
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

487
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,986
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

488
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,740
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

489
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,243
[Jonathan sighs]

490
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,457
[stammers] Can you just give me a second?

491
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,583
Of course.

492
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,631
Hey.

493
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,425
Hey.

494
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,971
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

495
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,599
I just...

496
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,809
[inhales deeply]

497
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,146
Can we talk for a second?

498
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,401
[Jonathan] It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

499
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,528
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

500
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,156
I don't know.

501
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,449
It's weird.

502
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,163
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

503
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,039
No.

504
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,584
And she was there one second
and then, um...

505
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,211
gone.

506
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,921
I figured she bolted.

507
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,340
The cops think that she ran away.

508
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,344
But they don't know Barb.

509
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,014
And I went back to Steve's...

510
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,767
and I thought I...

511
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,644
saw something.

512
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,021
Some...

513
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,274
weird man or...

514
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,777
I don't know what it was.

515
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,159
I'm sorry.

516
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,163
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

517
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,081
I'm so sorry.

518
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,541
What'd he look like?

519
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,253
What?

520
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,589
This man you saw in the woods.

521
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,633
What'd he look like?

522
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,637
[stammers] I don't know.

523
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,433
It was almost like he...

524
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,559
he didn't have--

525
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,478
Didn't have a face?

526
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,565
How did you know that?

527
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,036
[indistinct chatter]

528
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,248
Aw, come on!

529

Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

533
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,387

Yeah, that's right.

537
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,686
"Odontalgia."

538
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,646
That was the word.

539
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,565
You know what it means?

540
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,109
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

541
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,235
[chuckles]

542
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,073
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

543
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,450
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

Her name's Sarah.

549
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,511
To Sarah.

550
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,690
I recognize you.

551
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,025
Are you famous or somethin'?

552
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,404
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

553
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,575
So, you on that case or what?

554
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,327
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

555
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,536
Dumb luck.

556
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,415
So that quarry, that's, uh...

557
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,917
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

558
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,337
Yeah.

559
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,718
[chuckling] Yeah, well, that's funny.

560
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,055
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

561
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,975
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

562
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,435
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

563
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,562
That's right.

564
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,815
So why are you lying to me, man?

565
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,236
What's your problem, bud?

566
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,946
I don't have a problem.

567
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,491
I'm just a concerned citizen.

568

Yeah?

569
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,495
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

570
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,871

I don't know. They...

579
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,442
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

Get close to what?

581
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,487
The body.

00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,743
What?

711
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,120
When you took my picture.

712
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,456
I shouldn't have taken that.

713
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,668
I'm, uh...

714
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,294
I'm sorry.

715
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,673
It's just--

716
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,299
That's it.

717
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,344
That's what I saw.

718
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,139
[Jonathan gasps]

719
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,807
My mom...

720
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,851
I thought she was crazy

721
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,686
'cause she said...

722
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,522
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

723
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,275
-And if he's alive--
-Then Barbara.

724
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,337
-Hey, Patty!
-Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

725
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,923
-Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
-Oh.

726
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,717
[laughing] I'll just be a minute.

727
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,892
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

728
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,018
Hey, you can't be back here.

729
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,686
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

730
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

731
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,899
-It's some emergency...
-What the hell are you talking about?

732
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,108
I don't work with O'Bannon.

733
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,985
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

734
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,989
[smacks lips] Okay.

735
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,407
[both grunt]

736
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,035
[panting]

737
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:01,842
[gasps]

738
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,268
[exhales heavily]

739
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,075
[breathing heavily]

740
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,861
[car approaching]

741
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,249
[groans]

742
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,799
Babe...

743
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,217
Jesus, the hell happened?

744
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,510
[Joyce sobbing]

745
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,929
Lonnie.
