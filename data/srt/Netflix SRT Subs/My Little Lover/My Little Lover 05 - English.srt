1
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:10,033
I wanna go back
to when it used to be,

2
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,933
back to when we were little
once again...

3
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,500
Minami...

4
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,133
Chiyomi!

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,233
I'm over here, Minami!

6
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,967
Tokyo?!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,933
What is this?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,167
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo!

9
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,400
Please! I wanna do this!

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,400
Let me stay with you Minami!

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,233
Wait.
How does that happen?

12
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:55,233
Is it true your father disappeared?

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,333
He left us for some woman.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,067
He's not my father anymore.

15
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,667
I hate you!

16
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,133
Don't give up, Minami!

17
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,500
Yeah!

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,267
I'm home.

19
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,300
Hello, this is Chiyomi.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,033
It's been two weeks in my tiny body.

21
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,467
I'm getting used to it.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,100
I'm gradually learning the ropes.

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,500
What's that?

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,367
I love your handkerchief!

25
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,467
I love this pattern.

26
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,567
How do I plant this?

27
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey, can I have this?
We can make a dress...

28
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,400
Minami! What are you doing!

29
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,800
It's looking kind of shabby so...

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
I got this.

31
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,667
Ivy?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,300
A curtain of ivy is actually nice.

33
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,367
Don't dig around too much!

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,367
Why?

35
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,967
Nothing...

36
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,633
How's that? Give it a go.

37
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,500
I can't go on command...

38
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,000
That's my dad's cake.

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,300
Yeah. Your dad's cake is the best!

40
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,333
They're great.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,367
You want some?

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,933
Yeah, I do, but...

43
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,533
All right, then.

44
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,067
You can have some.

45
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:31,067
Shunichi, can you help me
change the light bulb?

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,233
I'm coming!

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Later.

48
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,300
This is actually better.

49
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,733
There are things I can't get used to.

50
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,967
Because I'm a girl!

51
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,633
CHIYOMI'S BIG ADVENTURE

52
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,533
Okay. Please start.

53
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,633
Got it.

54
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:40,067
Hurry! Hurry!

55
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,633
Ouch!

56
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you okay?

57
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,167
Yeah.

58
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,300
Be careful.

59
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,367
Nope.

60
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm lost.

61
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:19,867
Ready?

62
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:23,133
No. My head is stuck!

63
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,233
So, that didn't work.

64
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,400
Ask Riku to make it for you.

65
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:35,167
He'll be more than happy to oblige.

66
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,667
What?

67
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,867
He made a doll looks just like you
and he keeps it in his pocket!

68
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
That's creepy for a guy.

69
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,900
Don't insult Riku.

70
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,067
I didn't...

71
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:04,233
We can go clothes
shopping after school.

72
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,100
No. I'm good.

73
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,633
Don't you want clothes?

74
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,433
I'm gonna sneak back home
tomorrow.

75
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:18,867
I'm getting my doll's clothes.

76
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,100
Now that's impossible.

77
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:26,300
I don't have any more lies
to get us into your room.

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,400
I know.

79
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm going by myself!

80
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,067
By yourself?

81
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:36,233
Yup. I'm gonna swing by
when you're in school.

82
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,767
You can't swing by.

83
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,333
We failed when I was there,
you can't do anything alone.

84
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,500
Excuse me?

85
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,400
I would've succeeded
if you weren't there!

86
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,633
We'll see about that.
Go by yourself, see if I care.

87
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,400
All right!

88
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm gonna get some cute clothes!

89
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,500
But wait... if it doesn't work out,

90
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,500
will you go shopping with me?

91
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,533
Chiyomi texted you?

92
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,167
She sent me a video, too.

93
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,367
"Ami, I'm sorry I disappeared.

94
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,733
How are you? I'm doing great.

95
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:39,533
The SOLO audition is tough
but I'm hanging in there.

96
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,567
I'm sending you some
new dance routines."

97
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,833
Here I go!

98
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Even early in the morning

99
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:56,067
Up, down, up, down

100
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,600
Here are the poses

101
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,333
She looks great. What a relief.

102
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,900
She looks full of energy.

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,733
I wish I took the audition, too.

104
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,067
Stop that!

105
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,567
What am I gonna do without you?

106
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Can you forward this video to me?

107
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,333
Yeah, sure thing.

108
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,733
Why won't she text me?

109
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:30,533
Well, her phone broke
and maybe she lost your address?

110
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,033
What about yours?

111
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,200
My address is simple.

112
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,033
It's "ami" three times,
so she remembered it.

113
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,267
Mine is "riku" four times, too.

114
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:04,200
First I need to make
an announcement.

115
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:09,800
There've been many break-ins
in our community lately.

116
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,933
You know,
many elders live around here,

117
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,133
they tend to leave the house
unlocked and get burglarized.

118
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,567
There's been no witness yet.

119
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,533
Call the police immediately
if you see anyone suspicious.

120
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,800
A thief, huh?

121
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:31,033
Let's beat 'em up if we catch him!

122
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,467
Like you can.

123
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Do we get an award if we catch him?

124
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,867
No! Don't try to fight him!

125
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,067
You never know what he'll do.

126
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:46,300
Let's begin our lesson,
open your textbook, page 78.

127
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,000
Recent break-ins...

128
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,933
Minami? Please put that away.

129
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,767
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,467
Yes?

131
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,033
It's you, Sakaizawa.

132
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,467
Mrs. Minami.

133
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:19,700
You can't open your door
without confirming who it is.

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,233
I'm fine. I have this to protect me.

135
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:31,033
Please stop joking!

136
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,933
So, what do you want?

137
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:39,433
Don't say it's another
class reunion.

138
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,133
I know you want to
find your future wife,

139
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,367
but it's getting too much.

140
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:51,533
You were my student
but I can't keep doing this for you.

141
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,433
That's not why I'm here.

142
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,033
Although I do wanna get married.

143
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,100
Anyway. The thing is,

144
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:03,167
there've been many break-ins lately.

145
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,500
You're often home alone
so I wanted to inform you.

146
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,433
Thank heavens, is that all?

147
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:14,433
Don't worry,
there's nothing here worth to steal.

148
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,233
But still...

149
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:20,867
You know, I have to go shopping.

150
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,767
Care to give me a lift on your bike?

151
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:29,867
I hope you're not serious.
It's against traffic regulations.

152
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm an officer, you know.

153
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,833
A thief?

154
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,500
Peace is the only thing
this town has.

155
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,267
But I guess we'll be fine.

156
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,867
Okay. It's time to go.

157
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,000
Off I go!

158
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,033
Good. It's open.

159
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, shoot!

160
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,867
Hey, guys.

161
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:39,767
Welcome.

162
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,167
Did you tell your wife you're here?

163
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:52,233
Why would I? This is my safe haven.

164
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,567
She gets angry with me too, you know.

165
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,533
I told Minami I could do this...

166
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,167
but this is gonna be tough!

167
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,033
Finally!

168
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,500
It's like climbing Mount Everest.

169
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,600
My box!

170
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,867
Great! It's still here.

171
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,800
So much to choose from!

172
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,000
This is cute.

173
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,800
I'll take this and this...

174
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,467
I gotta have this!

175
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,667
I definitely need a brush!

176
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:30,033
It's heavy. Maybe this is too much?

177
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,267
Oh, well.

178
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,667
So heavy...

179
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,333
You were against it too!

180
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,767
But you didn't have to slap her!

181
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:46,367
Stop saying that.

182
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,400
Don't make me.

183
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on, guys...

184
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:55,800
Don't make this about me,
I didn't ask for this.

185
00:16:56,367 --> 00:17:01,800
Chiyomi didn't leave
because I slapped her.

186
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,067
She left for the audition,

187
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,700
it doesn't matter what I did!

188
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,800
You've got it all wrong, dad...

189
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,800
You keep changing the subject!

190
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,600
Let's stop this, Ritsuko.

191
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,067
Don't tell me. Tell him!

192
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,367
You keep rolling your eyes.

193
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:23,267
I didn't.

194
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,033
You do! You wish you didn't marry me!

195
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,167
Guys, I'm the customer.

196
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,067
I never wished that!

197
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,433
Then why do you make that face?

198
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,767
Fine. I'm always the bad guy, right?

199
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:42,267
You always like to play the victim!

200
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,667
Stop the brutal honesty!

201
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,033
Hey!

202
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:56,567
I knew I'd find you here.

203
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:01,300
Oops... busted.

204
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,733
Ouch!

205
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,867
Come on!

206
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,967
You're hurting me!

207
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,800
You keep wandering off.

208
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,767
Let go of my ear.

209
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,433
I did all the prep work!

210
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:15,933
You're gonna rip it off!

211
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,933
So heavy.

212
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,567
Tomiko is not home yet.

213
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,033
What happened to them?

214
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,700
Is it all my fault?

215
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,300
Shoot, it's Tomiko!

216
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,067
Oh, no!

217
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,267
Or not...?

218
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,733
No one's home!

219
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:17,533
There's been many break-ins lately.

220
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:22,067
No way, is that the thief?

221
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:38,667
What am I gonna do?
I gotta tell Minami.

222
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:44,367
I'm happy to study with you again.

223
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:47,567
I can't stay for long.

224
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,667
I know.

225
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:04,267
Sayori. You're really tall.

226
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:09,300
What? Do you like petite girls?

227
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:12,633
That's not what I...

228
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,833
But someone as tall as me
would look better with you.

229
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:25,833
Sayori?

230
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,000
Masaya?

Winner of Kendo Competition
Noboru Minami

232
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,233
My hands...

233
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,600
So, you're okay!

234
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:25,433
I was worried. I couldn't reach you.

235
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:26,833
You know him?

236
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,333
Who the hell are you?

237
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,867
Stay away from my woman, punk!

238
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,867
Stop, didn't I tell you? We're done.

239
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:40,467
I don't believe that for a second!

240
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,233
-We were great together...
-Let go of me!

241
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,567
Let her go.

242
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
You little shit!

243
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,033
What do you think you're doing!

244
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,333
What?

245
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,900
I'm busy.

246
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,533
No one's home.

247
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:22,900
It's just me.

248
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,667
What do you expect?
You bailed on me!

249
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:33,467
No. I can't leave empty handed now.

250
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:38,167
No. I'll be fine on my own.

251
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:42,267
I'm fine! I gotta go!

252
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,767
She's had enough.

253
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,633
Can't you see she's avoiding you?

254
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:01,033
Be a man and take a hint.

255
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,433
Avoiding? Is that true, Sayori?

256
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:13,433
I have a boyfriend now.
So, I don't have time for you.

257
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:16,367
A boyfriend? Is it...

258
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:18,567
Is it....

259
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,600
Yes. We're gonna be engaged.

260
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,067
Right, Minami?

261
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,033
Yeah, right.

262
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,800
Stalk her again and I'll sue you.

263
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:36,300
Stalk?

264
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,333
You little shit!

265
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,900
I'll get you for this!

266
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:53,433
Give it back!

267
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,400
Oh, shoot!

268
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:19,000
Thief...

269
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:22,100
Thanks for protecting me.

270
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:24,900
It was nice.

271
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:34,833
I just said those things
on the spur of the moment.

272
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,500
But I meant it.

273
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,167
I wanna be with you.

274
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:47,400
I only wanna be with you, Minami.

275
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:54,900
Minami, what do you think of me?

276
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:00,633
Well...

277
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,133
...is here.

278
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,267
The thief is here.

279
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,133
No time!

280
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,133
Send!

281
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,400
Sorry.

282
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,167
From : Chiyomi
The thief is here.

283
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,333
What am I gonna do?

284
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:31,267
Oh, no!

285
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:48,900
What's wrong?

286
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,100
Sorry. I gotta go!

287
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Wait, Minami?

288
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,033
I'm sorry!

289
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:16,533
What now? I'm busy, can't this wait?

290
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,433
You're here? No!

291
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,833
Foot cramps!

292
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:36,167
What do you think you're doing?

293
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:37,300
Why did you come?

294
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,533
This is ridiculous!

295
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:40,767
Ridiculous?

296
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,033
We're not thieves!

297
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:46,267
What? An accomplice?

298
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,600
I don't wanna do this!

299
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,267
I told you, I'll make this right.

300
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,733
How?

301
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,067
Well, you know...

302
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,400
You have no plan!

303
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,100
Anyways,
you're not in your right mind.

304
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,333
Let's go home, okay?

305
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:08,400
I know. This isn't right.

306
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,200
But whose fault is that?

307
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,867
It's all your fault! You're a fraud!

308
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,833
A fraud?

309
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
No answer. Where's grandma?

310
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,067
Chiyomi!

311
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,900
Incoming Call
One Missed Call

312
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,300
Let's go.

313
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,600
Let go.

314
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:55,800
Come on.

315
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,333
Kanae, we can't do this!

316
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,967
Winner of Kendo Competition
Noboru Minami

317
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,100
Come on. Let's go.

318
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,367
No.

319
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,467
What if someone comes home?

320
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:34,367
We haven't found it yet!

321
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,300
We're leaving!

322
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,300
What am I gonna do?

323
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,367
They're coming!

324
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:49,967
That's it!

325
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,100
Come on. We'll find it soon.

326
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm begging you, we need to leave.

327
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,300
I think it's upstairs.

328
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,900
It can't be upstairs.

329
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:04,900
Stop!

330
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,167
This is a bad idea, Kanae.

331
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:22,233
We need to run!

332
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,600
Hurry! Let's get outta here!

333
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,467
Someone was home!

334
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,667
I did it!

335
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,767
Hurry! We can't get caught for this.

336
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:42,167
You got us into this situation.

337
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,467
What happened to your divorce paper?

338
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:47,633
I sent it!

339
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:50,633
She said she signed it
when I called her.

340
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,033
Why won't she file it?

341
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,267
Well...

342
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:57,200
Maybe she's lying.

343
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,800
Maybe she threw it away?!

344
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,100
Emiko is an honorable woman!

345
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:07,833
Kanae?

346
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,633
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it like that.

347
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,733
Wait.

348
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,333
Grandma?

349
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,267
Why are you in a hurry?

350
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,367
So, you're home.

351
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:57,267
My teacher warned us
about recent break-ins...

352
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,667
I was worried.

353
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:02,533
We're fine.

354
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,133
Good.

355
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,167
Chiyomi!

356
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,567
Minami!

357
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,533
Minami, you're home!
I'm so glad to see you!

358
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,767
Chiyomi, you're safe.

359
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,133
Minami...

360
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:54,533
So, I clawed up the stairs
in a hurry to send you a text.

361
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:58,333
I was almost found
and things got really bad...

362
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:02,533
So, the thief didn't come to my room?

363
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,200
The woman came, just for a second.

364
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,367
But her accomplice came...

365
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,700
Accomplice?

366
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I didn't get to see his face.
But he seemed useless.

367
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:17,067
He was so freaked
and they even started to bicker.

368
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:21,867
So, I ran them out of the house
with loud music!

369
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:28,033
That's weird.
Grandma said there was no break-in.

370
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,233
Well, she wasn't home.

371
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,533
But still.

372
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,567
I don't understand.
I think they left a mess.

373
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,767
Sis? I'm gonna borrow your book.

374
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,000
Is this it?

375
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
What's this doing here?

376
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,100
Did he hide this?

377
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,233
Shunichi?

378
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,433
What does he want
with doll's dresses Chiyomi put away?

379
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,733
What for?

380
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:53,933
Hello, this is SOLO audition workshop.

381
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,567
I'm a friend of the participant,
Chiyomi Horikiri.

382
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,633
Miss Horikiri?

383
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:05,667
Yes. I was hoping
to get in touch with her.

384
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,000
Is she available?

385
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,933
-Miss Horikiri?
-Yes.

386
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,133
Her full name?

387
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,733
Chiyomi Horikiri.

388
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,833
That's odd. 

389
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:21,267
There's no one here by that name.

390
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,667
No... are you sure?

391
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,867
Yes. There's no one here
by the name of Chiyomi or Horikiri.

392
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that so? I understand.

393
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:41,100
Thank you for calling.

394
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,700
Good news, the thief was arrested!

395
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:51,133
Our neighborhood watch
caught the thief on their patrol,

396
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,000
and called our officer.

397
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:56,633
Were they a couple?

398
00:35:56,933 --> 00:36:00,200
No, it was a man in his 20s.

399
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:02,767
Shunichi?

400
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,500
Why did you think they were a couple?

401
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,667
I just thought.

402
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,833
How terrifying.

403
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,300
Notification of Divorce

404
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:09,367
You!

405
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,733
Mother...

406
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,667
Noboru?

407
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:24,633
It's been a while.

408
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,533
You look great.

409
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,733
Why are you here?

410
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,700
I wanted to see your face.

411
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,367
Leave!

412
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,767
You have some nerve coming here.

413
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:55,267
Have you any idea
what you put your family through?

414
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,233
I'm so sorry.

415
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,167
Mother, I just...

416
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:00,700
Say no more.

417
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:04,733
I have no son.

418
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,467
Leave.

419
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,667
Right now!

420
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,700
-Leave!
-I'm sorry.

421
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:21,333
Never come back!

422
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,967
Hey, look at me.

423
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,033
How do I look?

424
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:44,667
Good, I guess?

425
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:47,300
What about this one?

426
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,033
They all look the same.

427
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,700
You want some cake?

428
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,933
Not now. I can't eat before bed.

429
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,733
Fine. I'll finish it off.

430
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:04,033
No! Did I put on some weight?

431
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,900
Hey, look what I brought!

432
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,533
How cute is this!

433
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,300
I knew a brush would come in handy!

434
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:22,600
I love it! So pretty!

435
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,467
I wanna get back to my life.

436
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,500
That feeling won't change.

437
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:17,600
But on days like this...
I wish time could stop.

438
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:21,700
Just once in a blue moon.

439
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,200
NEXT EPISODE
EP.06 "I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH"

440
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:05,067
Minami, I'll protect you.

441
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,700
You know how I feel, right?

442
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,033
You shouldn't be here like this.

443
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:17,033
Go on.
You can have your way with me.

444
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,100
A group blind date?

445
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,733
Why are you crying?

446
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,533
Just leave me alone!

447
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,800
Let me out!

448
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,067
Chiyomi!

449
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,233
Just relax okay?

450
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:28,600
I can't!

451
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,667
DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

452
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,167
Is Shunichi a pervert?

453

STAY TUNED FOR NEXT TIME!
