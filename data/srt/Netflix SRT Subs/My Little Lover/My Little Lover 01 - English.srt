1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,533
"So then, the One Inch Samurai...

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,467
wore needle as a sword on his hip
made for him by the old man,

3
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:23,000
boarded a bowl for a ship
given to him by the old lady,

4
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,700
and sailed off to the capital."

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,933
That's cool for a little guy.

6
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:36,333
That's right, although his body was small,
he was very brave.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,800
I wanna see him.

8
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:52,967
There is a legend in our city
about a One Inch Princess.

9
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,533
One Inch Princess?

10
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,167
Really? Is that true?

11
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,667
Well...

12
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,767
I wonder...

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,233
One Inch Princess.

14
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,533
One Inch Princess?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,033
Where are you?

16
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:22,667
Hello?

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,700
Miss One Inch Princess?

18
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,400
Where are you, One Inch Princess?

19
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:29,800
Over here?

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,433
I hope we can find her.

21
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:35,233
We'll find her.

22
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,733
Maybe behind these grasses.

23
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,967
It's a frog.

24
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,967
Maybe over here?

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,400
One Inch Princess.

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,767
Where is she?

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,333
Oh, no. I got all wet.

28
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:27,967
What happened? Are you okay?

29
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,267
One Inch Princess...

30
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,133
She was for real. I just saw her.

31
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,233
Look, over there.

32
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:45,833
You see the stream over there?

33
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,900
What about over there?

34
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,233
I love you, Chiyomi.

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,333
I love you.

36
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,300
I love you, too, Minami.

37
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,900
So, you and me together forever.

38
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:00,667
What?

39
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,000
Together forever.

40
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,333
Pinky promise.

41
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:25,100
-Cross my heart and hope to die
-Cross my heart and hope to die

42
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,200
-Stick a needle in my eye
-Stick a needle in my eye

43
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,567
Minami, look over there.

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Awesome.

45
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,200
I fell asleep.

46
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,733
The sun's up already.

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Why that dream now?

48
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,600
All right. Let's do some more work.

49
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,633
AUTHOR: MICHAELA MOON RABBIT
THE BLUE FAIRY - EPISODE 10

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,300
Childhood memories are unreliable.

51
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,933
Reality and fantasy are muddled together.

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't know what's real anymore.

53
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,000
The One Inch Princess, was she for real?

54
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,300
The beautiful rainbow,
was that an illusion?

55
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:31,967
What about the promise
I made with Minami?

56
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,433
Morning.

57
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,733
Chiyomi, don't be late
on your first day of school.

58
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,667
LONG FORGOTTEN FIRST LOVE

59
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,600
I'll just have juice today.

60
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,667
The new school year starts today?

61
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:36,367
Lilacs are in season.
The language of flowers for lilacs...

62
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,633
Did you stay up late?

63
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,067
Net surfing for dance sequences?

64
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,033
Wrong.

65
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,533
Are you studying hard?

66
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,933
I guess I'm sort of studying.

67
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:52,500
You're a senior now,
you need to be ready for your exam.

68
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:53,800
Okay, okay.

69
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:58,233
Asuka, you need to get
into a good high school.

70
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,100
You girls need to know how lazy you are,
just like your father.

71
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay. I got your message.

72
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:10,100
Honey. you need to be concerned, too.

73
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,667
Because I'm too lazy.

74
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:32,733
Hi, Chiyomi.
Could you give this to Shunichi?

75
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,733
What?

76
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,567
He forgot his lunch...

77
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,033
Thanks, here.

78
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,267
Sure...

79
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,367
My lunch.

80
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:14,533
I'm sorry.

81
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,233
This is from your mom.

82
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,400
Okay, bye.

83
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:39,100
No way. That just did not happen.

84
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:47,800
TATEYAMA DAIICHI HIGH SCHOOL

85
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,833
Chiyomi? Earth to Chiyomi?

86
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,867
What?

87
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,167
What's wrong? You zoned out.

88
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,367
It's nothing...

89
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm so happy you're in my class, Ami.

90
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,700
We have the same course.

91
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,967
Thank God Riku is with us.
Show me your homework again?

92
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,533
Yes, please.

93
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,233
Is that all I am to you?

94
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,700
That's not true.

95
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,233
How convincing.

96
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,767
Sayori's in our class, too?

97
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,567
Pheromone?

98
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:30,633
Who?

99
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh, you're talking about Sayori.

100
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,700
I can't stand it,

101
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,367
watching the guys go crazy over her.

102
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,500
Check her out.

103
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,767
She's so hot.

104
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:43,933
Man.

105
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,467
She's a knockout.

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,333
Same class with her,
can you believe our luck?.

107
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,100
I wanna go out with her.

108
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,733
She melts my heart like butter.

109
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,867
I'm not like them.

110
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,333
Minami.

111
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,600
CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION: BOYS

112
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,733
Minami.

113
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:10,133
This means our boy class president
is Minami.

114
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Minami, we're counting on you.

115
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:17,367
No way. I wanna work with Minami.

116
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,967
I wanna be class president
with Minami, too.

117
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,033
Your neighbor is as popular as ever.

118
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,100
He's a cold fish.

119
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,833
Next up, the girls.

120
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,033
CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION: GIRLS

121
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,067
Sayori.

122
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,000
Chiyomi.

123
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:47,467
Why me? My grades suck.

124
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,700
Remember last year?

125
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,200
Come to our crepe shop!

126
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,867
Have our crepes!

127
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,433
That's because our class wasn't
selling enough.

128
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,700
What about field day?

129
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:14,767
That's because our class was losing.

130
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:20,167
Now everyone knows you elevate the class.

131
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,167
This is the last one.

132
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,833
Chiyomi.

133
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,033
No way.

134
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:32,200
This means Chiyomi will be
our girl class president.

135
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,500
Wait a minute...

136
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,967
Do it.

137
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,167
Can we count on you?

138
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:42,167
But... wait. I don't know...

139
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,233
Ms. Oono.

140
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:44,967
Yes, Sayori?

141
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,900
If it's okay, I really want to run
for class president once again.

142
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,333
But Chiyomi was just elected president.

143
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Chiyomi, do you wanna do it?

144
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Me?

145
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,867
Not really.

146
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,633
Well, I...

147
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,700
I wanna be class president.

148
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,267
Ms. Oono.

149
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,367
Why hesitate? She's willing.

150
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,433
You're right.

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,367
Since Chiyomi is not so willing...

152
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,000
shall we ask Sayori to do it?

153
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,133
Okay, Chiyomi?

154
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:44,967
Chiyomi?

155
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,167
Yes. Of course.

156
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,800
Give a round of applause
to our new girl class president.

157
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,700
My best regards.

158
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,167
Likewise.

159
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,667
You know, the tournament is coming up.

160
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,867
Can you two help with our choreography?

161
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:55,967
Okay. We got it.

162
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,367
Really?

163
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:01,033
Yeah. I really wanna
do something really cool...

164
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,900
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

165
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,967
Choreography for the tournament...

166
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,600
It's gonna be great.

167
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,200
We have to start thinking.

168
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,033
You know what...

169
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,033
Hey, girls.

170
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,167
Riku, I didn't know
handcraft club worked so late.

171
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,667
Well, yeah.

172
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,333
What's up, Chiyomi?

173
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,433
To tell you the truth...

174
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
SOLO DANCE TEAM AUDITION

175
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,833
What? You're kidding.

176
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,833
Your idol dance team?

177
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,800
I wanna audition, too.

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Right?

179
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,433
It's in Tokyo?

180
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,300
Audition in Tokyo? I can't go.

181
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:07,267
My parents would never let me.

182
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,767
That's the problem.

183
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:13,300
If I pass, I have to move to Tokyo.

184
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,567
Move to Tokyo?

185
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,533
If you pass, are you dropping out?

186
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,667
Your parents will kill you.

187
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,000
I know.

188
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,033
You can't be serious.

189
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,200
Just a bit.

190
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,000
Hey, Chiyomi?

191
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,700
Let's talk about this another time.

192
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,800
I actually have plans today.

193
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,067
Fine.

194
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,167
Riku, can you walk her home?

195
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,200
Bye, guys.

196
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,067
What? Wait.

197
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,467
Chiyomi, aren't you interested in dating?

198
00:16:56,633 --> 00:17:00,567
It's not that I don't,
but I don't have faith in it.

199
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:02,667
No faith, huh?

200
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,167
Okay, then...

201
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,300
Have you ever liked anyone?

202
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:17,500
Maybe when I was little,
but I forgot all about it.

203
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,933
All right.

204
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:29,067
I got into reading novels
on the Internet lately,

205
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:34,100
and I found this cool online novel.

206
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,367
An online novel?

207
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:40,367
Yup.

208
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,700
Thanks for walking me home.

209
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:51,867
Not at all.

210
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:59,233
Remember Blue Fairy by
Michaela Moon Rabbit I talked about?

211
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,367
It's really great.

212
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,233
I really love it.

213
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:10,700
And you.

214
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:17,133
Will I? I guess I have to read it.

215
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,633
Yeah, you should.

216
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,167
Bye.

217
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,567
Chiyomi?

218
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,433
Well...

219
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,367
What is it?

220
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,367
Never mind.

221
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:44,967
Tell me.

222
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,733
What is it?

223
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:54,200
No... I'll tell you tomorrow.

224
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay.

225
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,233
Bye.

226
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,000
Bye.

227
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,133
Riku read my novel.

228
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,467
All right.

229
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,733
A fairy loses its magic
when it falls in love.

230
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,567
The fairy also loses its smile...

231
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,033
and ages very quickly.

232
00:19:55,467 --> 00:20:00,633
Soon it will fall into an eternal slumber.

233
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,400
But when that love is reciprocated,

234
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,733
the fairy will turn into a human
in exchange for its magic.

235
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,300
Humans age, but their smile...

236
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,400
Hey, Michaela Moon Rabbit.

237
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,267
Ms. Oono.

238
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,100
Don't worry, I haven't told a soul.

239
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,667
Promise me.

240
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,567
Why not? You're doing something you love.

241
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:44,867
No way. I'll be mortified
and never come to school.

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,767
Now you're famous among readers
of online novels.

243
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:55,800
It's only luck. I just wrote
everything I had bottled up inside.

244
00:20:55,867 --> 00:21:02,800
Then it must be your own
unique imaginary scenery?

245
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:06,000
No, now you're exaggerating.

246
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,700
What is this about?

247
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,567
First of all...

248
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,500
This is for you.

249
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,333
But it's not my birthday.

250
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,767
Yeah, I know.

251
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:33,600
I wanted to give it to you yesterday,
but I couldn't.

252
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,600
What is it?

253
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,967
It's so cute.

254
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,733
Did you make this?

255
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:48,033
-Yeah.
-It's amazing.

256
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,467
Moon and rabbit?

257
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:55,167
Does this mean...?

258
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:59,100
I'm a big fan of Michaela Moon Rabbit.

259
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,900
Okay.

260
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,167
That's why I want you to have it.

261
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,700
You knew.

262
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,767
Sorry I didn't tell you.

263
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:21,000
So, you knew about it yesterday.

264
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:26,933
I just couldn't tell you yesterday.

265
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,700
Darn, all this time you knew.

266
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,733
What are they blathering about?

267
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,167
Go on. Tell her.

268
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,000
So, listen.

269
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,333
I...

270
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,067
I love...

271
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,900
Michaela Moon Rabbit.

272
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,500
Thanks.

273
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,600
I love...

274
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,867
you.

275
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,100
Chiyomi Horikiri.

276
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,367
Yes.

277
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:04,867
What?

278
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,867
I know you got a lot on your plate...

279
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,567
and you don't have the time.

280
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,633
But I had to tell you
how I feel about you.

281
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,733
I wanna nominate myself.

282
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,133
So, I'm not gonna rush you.

283
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Riku?

284
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,600
I'll walk away if there's someone.

285
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:51,000
But if there isn't someone else...

286
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:57,300
I'll always be waiting for you
to choose me.

287
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:02,033
Riku is such a great guy.

288
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,433
He's fun to talk to. He's sweet.

289
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:10,633
And he likes me,
which means he clearly has great taste.

290
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:22,400
Shoot.

291
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,100
The rain... I forgot my umbrella.

292
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:44,467
Are you studying for med school?

293
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,200
Why?

294
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,933
Why does it make me cry?

295
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,867
I love you, Chiyomi.

296
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:30,867
I love you.

297
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,067
I'm...

298
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:52,300
I'm in love with Minami...

299
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,700
all this time...

300
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:37,100
You're going to Tokyo?

301
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Explain yourself.

302
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:42,800
My favorite dance team
is having an audition.

303
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,267
But you don't have to go now,
you have your exams this year.

304
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:51,000
But I wanna go now. I wanna go.

305
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,567
You're not going.

306
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:56,267
You're too young to go
to Tokyo all by yourself.

307
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,767
I agree. Your silly dance team can wait.

308
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,800
"Silly dance team"?

309
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,900
Well, I'm not going to college.

310
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,267
I won't take the exams.

311
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:11,900
I know what I want,
and college is just a waste of time.

312
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:17,967
Listen to yourself. You got into
a decent high school, don't waste it.

313
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,133
Your mom is right.

314
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,867
You'll regret this later.

315
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,500
Why are you two suddenly teaming up?

316
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,533
You never listened to your mom?

317
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,667
What are you saying?

318
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:32,233
I know you had a shotgun wedding!

319
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,400
Honey...

320
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,333
Chiyomi. We're not done here.

321
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,200
The lightning is getting closer.

322
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,400
What?

323
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,100
Chiyomi?

324
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,633
BUOY ME A BOTTLE OF SOY SAUCE. MOM

325
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,467
Why is she making me run errands?

326
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,267
It's "buy," not "buoy."

327
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:32,600
Are you okay?

328
00:29:55,633 --> 00:30:00,033
Are you studying for med school?

329
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah.

330
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,900
I don't mean to pry,
but can you afford it?

331
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:09,000
Your mother is single, right?

332
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,733
Why don't you ask my father?

333
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:19,367
I'm sure he'll help you find a solution.

334
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,633
Minami.

335
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:48,567
What?

336
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,400
What do you want?

337
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,133
I'm going home.

338
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,900
Why do you ignore me?

339
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,233
I said, why do you ignore me?

340
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:17,033
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

341
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,633
You're nice to Sayori.

342
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:28,100
Were you with her this whole time?

343
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,767
Are you gonna date her?

344
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,367
Please. It has nothing to do with you.

345
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,767
You're right.

346
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm nothing to you.

347
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,567
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

348
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,067
Damn.

349
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:57,267
You need to stop showing up
everywhere I go.

350
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,500
When did I ever?

351
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,100
Earlier, when I was with Sayori.

352
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:06,567
-I didn't plan it.
-Not that I care.

353
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm out here because
I fought with my parents.

354
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,833
A fight?

355
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:16,367
They're mad at me
for not wanting to college.

356
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:18,800
You're not?

357
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:20,433
I have my goals.

358
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,867
They wouldn't hear me out.

359
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,467
You must be joking.

360
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
You're a spoiled brat.

361
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:39,800
What?

362
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:46,233
What would you say that? It hurts.

363
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:49,233
We used to be best friends.

364
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:51,367
Why?

365
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,367
Don't you get it?

366
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,300
I can't stand you anymore.

367
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:40,600
Hey!

368
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,600
Hold on!

369
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,967
Wait!

370
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,633
This place...

371
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,633
Where is she? Her phone is dead.

372
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,967
I thought she'd come home after my text.

373
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:37,100
Let's go find her.

374
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,700
-A storm's outside.
-That's why we go.

375
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,233
Can you two chill out?

376
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:46,033
Chiyomi. She's home.

377
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,733
-Hey, Sakaizawa.
-Is Chiyomi home?

378
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,633
No, why?

379
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,533
Just as I thought. I saw her at the park.

380
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,900
Officer, he slapped her.

381
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,333
Stop that.

382
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,500
She was in tears. I'm gonna arrest you.

383
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:06,567
Arrest him.

384
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:10,933
Stop the nonsense. Now take me to her.

385
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,433
My jacket.

386
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,233
Dad, shoes.

387
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
Come on.

388
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,200
Be careful.

389
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,700
It's getting worse.

390
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,967
No way. Come on back.

391
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,867
Wait.

392
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,967
Shunichi...

393
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:30,033
-Don't go.
-Shunichi.

394
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm so sorry.

395
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,100
I hate you!

396
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,767
Shunichi, let's go inside.

397
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,867
Bye, Mom.

398
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:30,067
Hey.

399
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,300
Don't you get it?

400
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,133
I can't stand you anymore.

401
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,200
What happened to us?

402
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,933
We used to be best friends.

403
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,967
I wanna go back to when it used to be...

404
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:38,533
back to when we were little once again...

405
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:41,067
Minami...

406
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:53,700
Why?

407
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,300
What would you say that? It hurts.

408
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:01,300
We used to be best friends.

409
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:03,433
Why?

410
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,733
What happened?

411
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,300
I turned into a One Inch Princess?

412
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,300
No...

413
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:56,733
No way!

414
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,067
Chiyomi?

415
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,700
NEXT EPISODE
EP. 02 "UNDER THE SAME ROOF?!"

416
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:06,433
I'm over here, Minami.

417
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,700
Chiyomi's gone missing?

418
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,900
Just between you and me,
I suspect she eloped.

419
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,800
They're gonna think I've been kidnapped.

420
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,667
There is someone suspicious...

421
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,500
right here among us.

422
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,367
This bathtub is perfect for me.
