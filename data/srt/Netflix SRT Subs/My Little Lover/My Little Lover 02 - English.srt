1
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,967
Hey, Michaela Moon Rabbit.

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,267
Now you're a famous online novelist.

3
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:32,867
I love... Michaela Moon Rabbit.

4
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,500
I love you. Chiyomi Horikiri.

5
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,233
I'm...

6
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:50,367
I'm in love with Minami.

7
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,767
All this time...

8
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:56,100
I won't take the exams.
I know what I want.

9
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,667
You're a spoiled brat.

10
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,133
I wanna go back
to when it used to be.

11
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,267
Back to when we were little again.

12
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,900
Minami.

13
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,567
What?

14
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,733
Why?

15
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,333
I turned into a One Inch Princess?

16
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,167
No...

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,767
No way.

18
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,667
Go away.

19
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,933
I said go away.

20
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,567
Go away.

21
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,833
I said go away.

22
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,967
Leave me alone.

23
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,867
Come. Stay on the road.

24
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,033
Come on, boy.

25
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,000
UNDER THE SAME ROOF?!

26
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,800
What am I gonna do?

27
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,033
What could I do?

28
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,800
Please find her.

29
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,967
We're counting on you.

30
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:51,667
She's a teenager after all,
so, keep your cool okay?

31
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,800
Your secret's safe with me.

32
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,400
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

33
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,167
Shunichi.

34
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,700
I just heard Chiyomi is missing.

35
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,100
Missing?

36
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:07,167
She didn't come home last night.

37
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,467
The officer just told me.

38
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,300
What would you say that? It hurts.

39
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,933
We used to be best friends.

40
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,533
I can't stand you anymore.

41
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,733
Her phone is off.

42
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,967
The officer saw Chiyomi
around Misaki Park last night.

43
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,233
There was a big storm...

44
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,600
I hope she's safe.

45
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,333
-Shunichi?
-Going for a run.

46
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,067
Chiyomi?

47
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,033
Chiyomi.

48
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:25,967
Chiyomi.

49
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:28,467
Chiyomi.

50
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,333
Chiyomi.

51
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,700
Chiyomi.

52
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:36,833
Minami?

53
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Chiyomi?

54
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,133
Minami.

55
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,200
Chiyomi. Where are you?

56
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm over here, Minami.

57
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,467
Over here.

58
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,200
Minami.

59
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,433
Is that you?

60
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,300
You're not dreaming.

61
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:41,467
It's really me, Chiyomi.

62
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,300
Minami.

63
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,600
Minami.

64
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:13,200
Chiyomi?

65
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,833
Hey, you're up early as usual.

66
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,433
Good morning.

67
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,167
Hey.

68
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Did you hear about Chiyomi?

69
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,667
Yes. My mom told me.

70
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,567
Can you believe she ran away?

71
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,533
I heard Chiyomi was getting abused.

72
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:43,467
You know what I think?
I think she eloped.

73
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,233
What?

74
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,867
Really?

75
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,367
Don't tell anyone, okay?

76
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,867
Chiyomi is only a teenager,
she doesn't need a bad rumor.

77
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,733
Eloped?

78
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,767
This is getting out of hand.

79
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,767
Abuse is not acceptable.

80
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,433
It's not abuse.

81
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:25,833
Sometimes you need
to show them who's boss.

82
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,733
But she didn't come home last night.

83
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:33,233
Guys, stop making this into a big fuss.

84
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,100
You all need to learn
how to keep your mouth shut.

85
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:45,400
Sakaizawa, it was you
who started running your mouth.

86
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,300
What am I gonna do?

87
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,600
You know what to do.

88
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,567
You need to explain what happened.

89
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,300
Calm down.

90
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,367
Wait. Wait, Minami.

91
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,167
Why?

92
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,067
I can't. I can't go back.

93
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,767
Eat this.

94
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,033
Thanks.

95
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,733
Don't touch my stuff.

96
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,867
Don't let my mom
or grandma find you.

97
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,633
Grandma is downstairs.

98
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,667
Got it.

99
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,600
What now?

100
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,400
This plant's dead.
I don't need it so you can use it.

101
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,300
What?

102
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,433
Shunichi, come and eat your breakfast.

103
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,067
I'll be right down.

104
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,633
That was close.

105
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,167
Ms. Oono.

106
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,933
Where's Chiyomi?

107
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm worried.
Her mom called me last night.

108
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,567
I know you kids were close.

109
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,200
She's not sick, is she?

110
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:05,167
You don't need to be worried.

111
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,067
I know it's impossible...

112
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,867
but we've all decided
to keep this quiet.

113
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,033
Ms. Oono.

114
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,867
- Ms. Oono.
- Mr. Sasaki?

115
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,767
Oh, my God. I just heard the bad news.

116
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,900
I heard Chiyomi went missing?

117
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,833
Missing?

118
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:36,333
So, this is Minami's room.

119
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,200
He's Mr. Perfect in school.

120
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,800
But his room is a mess.

121
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:06,700
I guess he still plays kendama.

122
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,367
You're so silly, Minami.

123
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,433
Wait.

124
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I don't know how long
it's been sitting here.

125
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:24,800
An honor student has great notes.

126
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,667
Is that me?

127
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,867
Oopsy daisy.

128
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,933
Boy's room is always a mess.

129
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:14,167
So, Grandma cleans his room, huh?

130
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,067
He shouldn't leave this out.

131
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:04,967
Good.

132
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:13,667
My gosh, he left the window open.

133
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,767
All done.

134
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,267
It's cold.

135
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm freezing. I'm freezing.

136
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,867
I wonder what Chiyomi is up to.

137
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,267
I hope she's not hungry.

138
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,567
May I join you?

139
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,733
Sure.

140
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,100
You know those two.

141
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,033
Sayori is so proactive.

142
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,233
Hey, Minami. Are you here?

143
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,900
Hey, man, time for lunch.

144
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,733
Eat in your own classroom.

145
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,600
Dude, can't you see
I'm doing you a favor?

146
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,500
You'd be eating alone without me.

147
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,000
Hello.

148
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,467
Pheromone!

149
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:14,833
Shut up.

150
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,700
You didn't tell me about Phe... Sayori.

151
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,200
We're class presidents.

152
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,333
Class presidents?

153
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,967
Okay then.

154
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,867
Aren't you here to persuade
me back to kendo club?

155
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,767
Not really.

156
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:35,700
I told you I'm done with sports clubs.

157
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,300
Man, you're so boring.

158
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,867
Hey, I just heard from Sasaki.

159
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,067
Who?

160
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,400
Our kendo coach, dummy.

161
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,067
That blabbing meat head.

162
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,800
Well, he said your neighbor's missing?

163
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,767
I know you hated her,
but she's actually my type.

164
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,700
I think you're great too.

165
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,567
Well, thanks.

166
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,500
Who would've thought that Chiyomi...

167
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:14,867
You never know what those
innocent types are up to.

168
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,700
- Pheromone.
- Ami, stop.

169
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,400
What's up?

170
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,433
Do people...?

171
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:35,233
Is it possible for people to shrink?

172
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,133
Come again?

173
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,767
Never mind.

174
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,367
Minami?

175
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,100
Sayori, can you tell
Ms. Oono I went home?

176
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,133
What, are you sick or something?

177
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,267
Something like that.

178
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,667
Hey.

179
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,033
You're home.

180
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,367
Hey, Grandma.

181
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,867
What's gotten into that boy?

182
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,500
Chiyomi.

183
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Chiyomi.

184
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Did you clean my room?

185
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,667
I did.

186
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,633
Minami.

187
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,700
Minami.

188
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm over here, Minami.

189
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,867
I'm out here.

190
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,700
Thank God.

191
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,300
Thank you.

192
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,367
What's going on?

193
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,667
It's nothing.

194
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,767
All right.

195
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,300
I was so scared.

196
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,700
Thanks for coming back.

197
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:14,933
Bad news, everyone from school
knows you're missing.

198
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,000
Seriously? I have news too.

199
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,667
The neighborhood is
gathering a search party.

200
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,333
A search party?

201
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,133
We left my stuff back there, right?

202
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:33,600
They're gonna think I got kidnapped,
raped and murdered.

203
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Kidnapped, raped and murdered?

204
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,500
Chiyomi?

205
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,867
I hope we don't find her here.

206
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:46,633
A runaway won't come down here.

207
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Why am I doing this?

208
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,633
She owes me big time.

209
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:45,700
Hey, what are you doing
out of school?

210
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,433
I got a stomachache.

211
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,100
Really?

212
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:03,133
Chiyomi is still missing.
Did anything happen at school?

213
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,533
Not that I know of.

214
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,300
What's that?

215
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,067
I got a lot of pills for my stomach.

216
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:21,033
Ouch. If you'll excuse me...

217
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,967
Now he knows I'm hiding something.

218
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:33,367
Don't worry. He's not that sharp.

219
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,467
Just go home already.

220
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,700
Why won't you go home?

221
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,767
Because...

222
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,067
my dad might understand, but my mom...

223
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,500
You saw what?

224
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:53,967
A One Inch Princess.

225
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,833
You know that's not true.

226
00:23:56,933 --> 00:24:00,300
I saw her at the river with Minami.

227
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,967
Enough. Can't you see Mommy is busy?

228
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,133
No way.

229
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,767
But they're your parents.

230
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:10,667
That's why.

231
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:14,767
My parents can't see me.

232
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:18,967
They'll be in shock.
I'll make them suffer.

233
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,800
But why do I have to...?

234
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,567
At least let them know you're okay.

235
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,967
I'll make it anonymous.

236
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,567
There.

237
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,133
What could I say?

238
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:48,200
Shunichi.

239
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,100
What's wrong?

240
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:04,500
They found what might belong
to Chiyomi at Misaki Park.

241
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:10,133
I told her to go buy soy sauce
in the rain.

242
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,033
It's not your fault, Mom.

243
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:15,500
I should've never sent her away.

244
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:19,600
Pull yourself together.
We know nothing yet.

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Ritsuko.

246
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,400
Emiko, Tomiko.

247
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,133
We heard you found something.

248
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:30,867
Thanks for coming.

249
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,233
Emiko, thank you.

250
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,500
Really, thanks for coming.

251
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,333
Riku, Ami?

252
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,467
Minami.

253
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:47,300
We were really worried about Chiyomi.

254
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,000
So, we went to Misaki Park
to look for her...

255
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:55,333
and we found what Chiyomi bought.

256
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,900
Soy... Soy sauce.

257
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,367
Ami.

258
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:07,033
Chin up, everyone.
We can't assume the worst.

259
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:12,133
But this is way out of our hands.

260
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,500
Someone could've taken her.

261
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,700
I actually agree with him.

262
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,333
All day long, I've been searching,
and I've come to one conclusion.

263
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,233
There is someone suspicious...

264
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,867
right here among us.

265
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:42,067
The suspicious one in question...

266
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,067
The one in question...

267
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,633
That's...

268
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,233
you!

269
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Me?

270
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,100
Why me?

271
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:36,233
I've been worried about Chiyomi
since yesterday.

272
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,233
We've been searching for her.

273
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:44,200
That's my point exactly.
You were worried since yesterday?

274
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:50,533
The only ones who knew about her
disappearance was her family and me.

275
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,333
I called Ami last night.

276
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:59,600
She did, and I called Riku immediately.

277
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:07,833
That's classified. You can't tell him.

278
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:13,700
She could've ran away,
or maybe even worse.

279
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,133
But we are best friends.

280
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,367
It's because...

281
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,300
I love Chiyomi.

282
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:28,033
It's true. I told her yesterday.

283
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,800
Just as I've predicted.

284
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:36,933
Chiyomi dumped you yesterday,
and in rage, you must've--

285
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,833
Will you stop? She didn't dump me.

286
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:41,867
I have a chance.

287
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:45,400
I saw you on a date with her.

288
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:48,367
-Is that true?
-It wasn't a date.

289
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:53,033
It's you! Give me back my Chiyomi!

290
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,133
Hello? They're busy at the moment.

291
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,667
Is that you? Chiyomi.

292
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,033
Hello? Chiyomi?

293
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,333
Give it to me. Chiyomi?

294
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:21,433
It's me. I'm sorry you're worried.

295
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:25,633
I wanted to call, but my phone broke.

296
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,900
You idiot. Where are you?

297
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:31,533
Come home right now. We're not mad.

298
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,733
I'm sorry. I can't.

299
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,633
What do you mean?

300
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,933
I'm in Tokyo.

301
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,500
Tokyo?

302
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,700
What is this?

303
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,600
Have you any idea how worried we are?

304
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:52,467
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo.

305
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,367
Please. I wanna do this.

306
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,133
Trust me.

307
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,467
I won't do anything to upset you.

308
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,867
I won't allow it. You fool!

309
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,033
Chiyomi?

310
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,300
I just wanted to let you
know that I'm okay. Bye.

311
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,900
Wait. Where are you staying in Tokyo?

312
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,800
I'll call you later. Bye.

313
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,733
Hey. Chiyomi.

314
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:27,400
Gimme the phone.
Sweetie, are you there?

315
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:38,867
She should've told us.

316
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,933
I'm happy she's okay.

317
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,233
Keep me updated?

318
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,433
I'm sorry about all this.

319
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm lost for words.

320
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,033
I'm happy she's safe.

321
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,733
-Sorry to trouble you.
-Thank you.

322
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,667
See, didn't I tell you not to worry?

323
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,133
A runaway. Simple as that.

324
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,467
Hey.

325
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,933
What was that about?

326
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,467
Well, you told me
I should call home.

327
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,733
Tokyo? Aren't you going home yet?

328
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,233
I'm going home.

329
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,100
Of course I wanna go home.

330
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,567
When I grow back.

331
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,200
When you grow back?

332
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:43,267
I can't go home looking like this.

333
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,200
My parents would be devastated.

334
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:51,967
It's better to make them mad
than breaking their hearts.

335
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,533
I see that, but...

336
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:58,567
Plus, I won't stay like this forever.

337
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:02,400
I know I'll grow back soon. So...

338
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,900
So, please.

339
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,733
Let me stay.

340
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,133
Let me stay with you, Minami.

341
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,667
Wait. How does that happen?

342
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,367
I'm begging you.
I won't get in your way.

343
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,133
Just let me stay.

344
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,800
This is great.

345
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,067
This bathtub is perfect for me.

346
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,400
This is insane.

347
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,367
Minami? I can't reach the soap.

348
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,133
Can you get it for me?

349
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,633
Will you please?

350
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:07,600
Don't look.

351
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,100
Don't want to.

352
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,867
And she said, "just let me stay."

353
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,867
I'm done.

354
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,700
Okay, my turn.

355
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,767
That was a shocker.

356
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:59,233
I guess he works out.

357
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,667
This is awesome.

358
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:47,900
Hey.

359
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,233
Minami?

360
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,667
What now?

361
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,600
Thank you so much.

362
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,633
Thanks for letting me stay.

363
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,233
Don't.

364
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,600
But...

365
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,233
Just go to bed.

366
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,333
Okay.

367
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,733
Isn't this our first sleepover?

368
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,067
Of course.

369
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,167
It's my first time to be in your room.

370
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,433
I got this room in junior high.

371
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,233
You're the first girl here.

372
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,767
Really?

373
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:16,000
Is Sayori... your girlfriend?

374
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:19,233
What?

375
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:23,233
I saw you with her yesterday.

376
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:29,433
Why don't you ask my father?

377
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,733
I'm sure he'll help you find a solution.

378
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,533
A solution?

379
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:41,933
My father is an influential man
around here.

380
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,000
He can get you a scholarship.

381
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,033
If you are up to it.

382
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,600
Up to it?

383
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,167
Isn't it a great idea?

384
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm busy.

385
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,667
He has long eyelashes.

386
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,400
Minami.

387
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:02,700
My beautiful princess.

388
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:03,800

Marry me.

390
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:09,833
-What's this?
-Something more normal.

391
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,567
It's delicious.

392
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,900
Don't. Stop.

393
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:21,433
My grandma said this shrine
enshrines a magical mallet.

394
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,833
He used it and grew back
on a full moon.

395
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,733
Oh, my God.

396
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,600
I can finally go back.

397
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,600
