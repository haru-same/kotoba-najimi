1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,000
One Inch Princess?

2
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:13,467
Really? Is that true?

3
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,033
Well, I wonder...

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,100
You never listened to your mom!

5
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,267
What are you saying?

6
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,700
I know you had a shotgun wedding!

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,900
I wanna go back to how it used to be...

8
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,967
back to when we were little once again...

9
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,267
Minami...

10
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,000
Chiyomi!

11
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,467
I'm over here, Minami!

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,867
Tokyo?!

13
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:17,333
What is this?

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,167
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo!

15
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me stay with you, Minami!

16
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,733
Wait. How does that happen?

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
Can't you see...
my heart can get hurt too.

18
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,900
Why are you crying?

19
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,933
Just leave me alone!

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,800
No... are you sure?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,800
Yes. There's no one here
by the name of Chiyomi or Horikiri.

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,733
one inch princess@beeble.co.jp

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,367
This email address...

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,633
If that's so...

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,967
Shunichi and Chiyomi are...

26
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:21,800
She's sewing that
for the One Inch Princess.

27
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:24,933
One Inch Princess?

28
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:30,200
You know the legend about a tiny princess.

29
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,167
Tomiko said she saw one yesterday.

30
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,133
A hobbit princess?

31
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,567
If it wasn't for Shunichi,
she would've started a fire.

32
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,067
Really?

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,767
Grandma, the stove is on!

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,933
What?

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,300
Hey, Noboru.

36
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,567
What?

37
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,867
I'm glad she seems better, but ...

38
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:12,633
Okay, I'll check on her
when you're at work.

39
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,633
Thanks, Ritsuko.

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,533
You must have enough problems.

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,800
This will help me
when I get some fresh air, so...

42
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,900
Thanks for the tea.

43
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,433
Bye now.

44
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,867
Tomiko, see you later.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
See you later.

46
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,900
I'm sorry, Mom.

47
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:32,233
18 YEAR OLD PROPOSAL

48
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,767
What? You're staying home?

49
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,800
Yup.

50
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,967
But didn't my grandma find you?

51
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,167
She's gonna try to find you again.

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,400
Not me, but the One Inch Princess.

53
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,933
I guess that's okay
because she's a bit off...

54
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,267
No, that's not okay at all.

55
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,733
Please! I'm worried about her!

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,767
I'll call you if something happens.

57
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:17,433
Pheromone is absent again?

58
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,733
This sucks!

59
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:24,900
What's the point of coming to school
if we can't smell her?

60
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,967
Really? That's great.

61
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,800
I finally got a text from Chiyomi.

62
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,100
What did she say?

63
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,733
It was mostly
about the audition workshop.

64
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,133
She said it's challenging but fun.

65
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm just happy to hear from her.

66
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,767
But I really wanted her
to send me a video too.

67
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,600
About that audition...

68
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:57,833
Yeah?

69
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,267
I don't think Chiyomi is actually there.

70
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,500
What?

71
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,767
The Legend of the One Inch Princess

72
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,033
Riku?

73
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,067
Ms. Oono?

74
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:47,233
So, you knew Chiyomi
is Michaela Moon Rabbit?

75
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,300
Yes.

76
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,733
I think her new novel
is based on this legend.

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,567
The plot is similar.

78
00:07:56,667 --> 00:08:01,000
I wonder why she suddenly
began to write a new novel.

79
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,667
Blue Fairy was just about
to reach its climax.

80
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,600
Maybe...

81
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,867
something happened and Chiyomi
had a change of heart.

82
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,500
Change of heart?

83
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:20,767
I just wrote down everything
I had bottled up inside.

84
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:27,800
Then it must be your own
unique imaginary scenery?

85
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,200
Miss Little Chobi in Your Pocket.

86
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,800
Maybe that's her current scenery?

87
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,300
And then she turned into Chobi?

88
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,833
What?

89
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,367
I'm kidding.

90
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,200
But maybe...

91
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,667
What?

92
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:51,800
Chiyomi has an impossible crush?

93
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,767
Why is that?

94
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,333
Chobi falls in love
with a man she could never have.

95
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,900
So, the physical size difference...

96
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,433
may be a metaphor
for unapproachable love?

97
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,233
I see.

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,267
Then who is the giant?

99
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,433
Is he the giant?

100
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:42,233
Well, see you later.
I'll get this to you when I'm done.

101
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:43,267
Sure.

102
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,300
Minami is reading it too?

103
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,000
Is that why he made the doll like me?

104
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:06,367
Riku and Ami know about the audition!

105
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,867
One Inch Princess? Come on out.

106
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,167
Are you over here?

107
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,767
There you are.

108
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,600
Wow! You made this for me?

109
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:14,467
You should be properly dressed
as the One Inch Princess.

110
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,100
This is beautiful! Thank you.

111
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,833
I am most delighted.

112
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,800
Someone's here.

113
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,667
It's Ritsuko.

114
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm coming!

115
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,167
You should hide.

116
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,067
Ouch!

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,433
I don't think he wants me around.

118
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:48,267
Why? You used to be so close.

119
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't think he ever loved me.

120
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,767
He once was in love
with someone else.

121
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,700
But when his heart was broken,
he decided to settle for me.

122
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:06,800
It's ready.

123
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,800
This is nice.

124
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,567
We have two daughters
and a successful business.

125
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,600
So, we forgot about our past...

126
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,067
But with Chiyomi gone,

127
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,500
we have more time for each other
and now we just fight every day.

128
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,133
I thought Joji was head over heels for you
after you got married.

129
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,667
Not at all! You know...

130
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,333
He never even proposed to me.

131
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,067
No!

132
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,700
Is that so?

133
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,933
We decided to marry because...

134
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,267
I was pregnant with Chiyomi.

135
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,933
The shot gun marriage was true.

136
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,367
That stupid Joji!

137
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm sorry, he's your husband.

138
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:14,933
I still remember him as a little brat.

139
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:18,067
It's all right. He is stupid Joji.

140
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,600
But when that stupid Joji married you,

141
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:26,067
I thought he finally
got his act together.

142
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,133
Before that, what was it he liked?

143
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,033
Heavy metal?

144
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,400
Heavy metal?!

145
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,933
That's right.

146
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,833
Stupid Joji was in a heavy metal band.

147
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:45,833
He sang in his silly getup!

148
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,033
He was a full grown man with no job.

149
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:54,433
He just kept saying he'll be
a famous musician in Tokyo.

150
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:58,200
Tokyo? Really, Dad?

151
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,800
No way.

152
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:13,267
But he became a hard worker
when he married you,

153
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,433
and raised money to start the cafe.

154
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,200
So, you know...

155
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:25,233
it's you who made Joji
the good man he is today.

156
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,167
That's a stretch.

157
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:33,333
Didn't you marry Joji because
you fell in love with him too?

158
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,933
Mom?

159
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,400
Maybe.

160
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,167
Exactly.

161
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:56,667
Maybe he drives you crazy
because you still love him?

162
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:03,033
Well, I don't know anymore.

163
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:08,500
Ritsuko, you work too hard!

164
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:09,967
What?

165
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,633
You need to cut him some slack.

166
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:17,633
Sometimes you need to relax.

167
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,633
It helps you a lot.

168
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,933
Why isn't she texting me back?

169
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,967
Welcome home.

170
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,367
Hi, Shunichi.

171
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,467
Hello.

172
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:50,067
Oh, no! Minami is back from school.

173
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:54,433
Thank you so much, you two.

174
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,700
A present. For your restaurant.

175
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:01,100
-Lucky me!
-That's nice.

176
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,033
-Thanks.
-Not at all.

177
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:10,533
Alstroemeria or Inca lily,
the language of flowers is...

178
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,767
Don't bother, I'll forget it.

179
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,700
She won't answer.

180
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,100
Chiyomi's friends. Been a while.

181
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,600
Hello.

182
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,900
Wait.

183
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,100
Did she go home again?

184
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,400
Here you are.

185
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:56,667
Thank you very much.

186
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,933
Hey, Shunichi!

187
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,033
Hello.

188
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:03,633
Hey.

189
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,767
-Hey.
-Hi there.

190
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,200
Cake?

191
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,167
I'm here for some coffee.

192
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,100
Really?
You're usually here for cake to go.

193
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,100
I wanted a coffee break.

194
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,367
I see.

195
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,067
Here you go.

196
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,567
Can I have iced coffee?

197
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,033
Well, isn't this nice.

198
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
Chiyomi...

199
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,367
where did she go?

200
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:38,133
Shunichi,
I heard you're studying hard.

201
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,100
I wish Chiyomi would do the same.

202
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:48,700
Apples don't fall far from the tree,
but I want her to go to college.

203
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,733
Chiyomi is hard-working too!

204
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,100
She may not like to study from a book.

205
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,867
But she can write...

206
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,667
and you know!

207
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,467
She's working to achieve
her dreams with dance.

208
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,133
Personally...

209
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,067
I admire that about Chiyomi!

210
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,333
Here's your iced coffee.

211
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:33,400
Minami,
your grandma found me today.

212
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,900
Chiyomi.

213
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,333
Maybe she's with grandma.

214
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,300
You're Riku... right?

215
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:49,233
Thank you for coming
and looking out for my daughter.

216
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,467
Not at all.

217
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,333
Thanks for the coffee.

218
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:54,667
So fast!

219
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,067
Hey Shunichi.

220
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,900
Sorry that I stayed so long.

221
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,133
Tomiko cheered me up.

222
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,800
Excuse me.

223
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,933
You can come out now,
One Inch Princess!

224
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:25,433
I'm sorry that took longer
than I thought.

225
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,767
It's always like that with Ritsuko,
but she always bring treats for me.

226
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,533
So, I can't complain.

227
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,400
Thank you.

228
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,767
We couldn't tell him.

229
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,500
Sorry, I said things
that made it difficult.

230
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:50,467
What can we do?
Chiyomi has her reasons too.

231
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:58,833
But maybe we should've told him
that Chiyomi isn't at the audition.

232
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,033
Where could she be?

233
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:03,833
What did you say?

234
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,367
Tell me! What's going on?

235
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:17,067
I used to be jealous of Noboru.

236
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:22,167
He's smart, handsome
and a kendo national champion,

237
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,067
and he lived next door!

238
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,433
With a beautiful wife!

239
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:26,900
He married Emiko!

240
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:32,300
In high school, we used to travel
all the way just to go see her.

241
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,600
She was the famous beauty.

242
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,967
But Noboru swept her away.

243
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:40,700
So what? You have a cute wife.

244
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:44,200
You see, men are romanticists.

245
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,067
We need to treasure sweet memories.

246
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:49,833
That's right.

247
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,467
You're back!

248
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
It's nice to see you back.

249
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:05,633
Where were you? We were swamped!

250
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,300
I was next door.

251
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,367
What?

252
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,667
I see that even when
our daughter is missing,

253
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,433
you have the audacity
to talk about Emiko.

254
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,267
Not in front of everyone!
We can talk later, okay?

255
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,800
When? You go out for drinks.

256
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,200
Point taken. But not now okay?

257
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,967
Then when? When will we ever talk?

258
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:31,533
Chiyomi is not at the audition.

259
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,300
What?

260
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,833
Then where is she?

261
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know! Do something!

262
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,200
You don't know? She's our daughter!

263
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,533
Don't yell at me. I can't stand this!

264
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:59,433
That sash looks nice too.

265
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:07,367
Guess what? I have
some delicious dessert for you.

266
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,000
I'll get you some. Wait here.

267
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,467
Hey!

268
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,200
Hey, Minami.

269
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,900
What are you doing?
Stop wandering around.

270
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,967
Sorry.

271
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:27,833
Yes?

272
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,667
We have a lot of company today.

273
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,633
This is our chance. Let's go.

274
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,433
But your grandma...

275
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,667
What?

276
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,733
Who's this?

277
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,333
Hello, Asuka.

278
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:48,467
Hello, Tomiko. Is Shunichi home?

279
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:54,067
I think you just missed him.
Why don't you wait for him inside?

280
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,167
Thank you.

281
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,600
Come on in.

282
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,500
There you are, Shunichi.

283
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,833
Yeah.

284
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,733
Shunichi.

285
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:08,667
Asuka?

286
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:13,467
I have to talk to you.

287
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,100
What?

288
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:28,100
Wait, Asuka, what is this about?

289
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:34,733
You know where Chiyomi is right?

290
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,533
Do you need to go?

291
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,100
What?

292
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,833
Well, actually...

293
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,633
I'm fine. Go on.

294
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,533
We can have our dessert later.

295
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
I know Chiyomi used this tablet
to write to us!

296
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:11,033
I'm sorry.
The last time I was here...

297
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,700
I looked inside.

298
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,333
What?

299
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,067
And then, the e-mail app was on.

300
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,467
Ouch!

301
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,433
It hurts...

302
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:37,967
Then later I realized...

303
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,400
it was my sister's address.

304
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,800
There's an explanation...

305
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,967
Chiyomi used this, right?

306
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,967
That's the only explanation.

307
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,967
Please, Shunichi!
Tell me where Chiyomi is!

308
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,333
My family is falling apart.

309
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,167
Asuka...

310
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:12,167
You knew my sister
didn't go to that audition.

311
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:20,867
Ouch!

312
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,767
I can't believe her.

313
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,000
Asuka.

314
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:54,433
Chiyomi has her reasons.

315
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:58,867
She just can't tell you yet.

316
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,400
This is tough on her too.

317
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,267
She's trying hard to get back home.

318
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,133
So...

319
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,867
give her time.

320
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:20,233
Can you give her a little more time?

321
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,767
Shunichi?

322
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:26,200
Does that mean...

323
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,900
you and Chiyomi...

324
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,633
are you two dating?

325
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:48,500
Chiyomi shares her secret with you,
something she can't tell her family.

326
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,900
Isn't that right?

327
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,233
Shunichi?

328
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,467
Chiyomi...

329
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:08,500
I have to protect her.

330
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,100
Chiyomi needs me right now.

331
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:25,133
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

332
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,300
Me too.

333
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,867
I liked you.

334
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:45,900
Huh?

335
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,667
I've had a crush on you too!

336
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,067
But whatever... forget it.

337
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,100
I trust you, Shunichi.

338
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,100
Bye.

339
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,100
Minami?

340
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,267
Chiyomi?

341
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,467
Are you all right?

342
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,933
You look dead tired.

343
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,300
What? Well... this is...

344
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,933
What should we do?

345
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:06,533
Grandma believes you are
the One Inch Princess.

346
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,233
We can't lie to her anymore.

347
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
I'm sorry.

348
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,333
I have big news!

349
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:19,700
My dad never proposed to my mom.

350
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:20,867
Huh?

351
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,667
Japanese Tavern: Izakaya
Gantaro

352
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:23,567
I feel you.

353
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:24,500
You do?

354
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:29,667
You know, I had to quit my
heavy metal band when I married her.

355
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:35,667
I went through some tough jobs
to make money to start our cafe.

356
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,567
I'm selling sundries and flowers.

357
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:42,500
-I'm trying my best!
-You sure are!

358
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,867
I've never cheated on her.

359
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,767
Something I could never do!

360
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,533
Once in a while I enjoy gazing
at a beautiful woman.

361
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,100
Emiko, right?

362
00:29:56,333 --> 00:30:01,333
But I can do that because I love my wife.

363
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,067
I feel you!

364
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,567
This is Izakaya Gantaro.

365
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,900
Who is this? You need to speak up.

366
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,533
Exactly.

367
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,500
Women don't understand that.

368
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:18,067
Chiyomi? Is that you?

369
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,933
Joji, it's Chiyomi.

370
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,800
I think you should go get Ritsuko.

371
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,167
Good idea.

372
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,767
Chiyomi?

373
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,133
Dad?

374
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,767
You idiot!

375
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:47,967
Is it true you're not auditioning?
Where are you wandering about?

376
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:54,333
I am wandering about.
I just can't tell you where.

377
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:59,700
Just like you and heavy metal,
I'm trying to figure myself out.

378
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:02,300
How did you know that?

379
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,667
I know everything!

380
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:10,100
I know you quit your band
so you could provide for us.

381
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:15,133
Are we bugged or something?

382
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,833
A bug?

383
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,300
-We're not bugged!
-But this can't be...

384
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,200
Dad, are you there?

385
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,500
Yeah.

386
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:31,867
I know you work hard for mom,
Asuka and me.

387
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,100
I know you love us very much!

388
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,433
I'm eternally grateful!

389
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:40,733
Yeah?

390
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,100
But, Mom...

391
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:47,633
she is a romantic,
way more than you think.

392
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,200
She still loves you very much!

393
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,600
Mom gets scared because
she doesn't know how you feel.

394
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,333
She seems tough...

395
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:06,467
but she's a romantic!
More than you know!

396
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:13,700
She wants to believe she married
for love and not from obligation.

397
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:20,033
She really wants to believe
that her love was mutual!

398
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:22,800
Yeah.

399
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,067
So...

400
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,300
You gotta tell Mom how you feel.

401
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,200
Tell her?

402
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,467
Yes. Dad...

403
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,667
because that's really important
for every girl.

404
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
I understand.

405
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,400
Thanks, Dad.

406
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:08,933
Bye.

407
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,033
Wait a second, Chiyomi.

408
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:19,600
I think you've got one thing wrong.

409
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,367
You know...

410
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,567
I didn't get married because of you.

411
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:33,800
I married your mother because
I loved her more than anything.

412
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:35,900
I still do.

413
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,733
I love her very much!

414
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,200
I'm crazy about her.

415
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,967
Yeah.

416
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,100
Ritsuko?

417
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,800
What? What's going on, Dad?

418
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:05,967
Chiyomi, I forgot to do
something very important.

419
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,967
It's been on my mind forever.

420
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,433
What is it?

421
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,500
With alstroemeria and my love.

422
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,833
I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you.

423
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,633
Thank you for putting up
with me for 18 years.

424
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,267
Will you...?

425
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:40,767
Will you marry me?

426
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:45,133
Will you stay with me
for the rest of your life?

427
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:56,400
What do these flowers mean?

428
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,133
The language of these flowers is...

429
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:07,933
"Hope for the future...

430
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,100
devotion and love."

431
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,767
Hope for the future.

432
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,933
Devotion and love.

433
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,267
My answer is yes.

434
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,067
Dad!

435
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,467
Cut it out!

436
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:44,333
Look at me, I'm a mess.

437
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:48,133
Did I get proposed to
looking like this?

438
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,033
Chiyomi is on the line!

439
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,533
Chiyomi?

440
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,367
Mom.

441
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,367
Honey.

442
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,267
I'm happy for you.

443
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,667
Thank you, Chiyomi.

444
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,400
Chiyomi?

445
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,733
What?

446
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,000
She hung up.

447
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,267
She's impossible.

448
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:24,400
But I'm happy for you.
Chiyomi was worried about you.

449
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,967
Chiyomi is a good girl.

450
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,733
Why don't we celebrate?
I'll cook up a feast!

451
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,367
Maybe that was...

452
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,700
Shunichi?

453
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,967
Everybody, get together!

454
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,333
Are you ready?

455
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,867
Where's Asuka?

456
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,233
What? Where is she?

457
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,233
We're taking a photo.

458
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,333
Great!

459
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,700
Hey, Shunichi!

460
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:29,300
I invited Shunichi.

461
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:32,067
The more the merrier!

462
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:37,867
It took Joji 18 years to propose.
This calls for a celebration!

463
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,800
Come here. Let's shoot.

464
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:42,867
Come on.

465
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,767
Is everyone ready?

466
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,000
A group photo?

467
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:54,000
I wish I could be in it too.

468
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,300
Here we go!

469
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,067
Get in, Chiyomi.

470
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:02,600
Really? But...

471
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,067
Come on.

472
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,067
Say cheese!

473
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,933
You surprised me when you
pushed me out of your pocket.

474
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,067
But you got to be in a special photo.

475
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,933
But still...

476
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:26,767
what if someone finds out?

477
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:30,867
Don't worry. No one will notice.

478
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,867
But...

479
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,300
Stop worrying.

480
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:41,900
Even if someone finds out,
I'll protect you no matter what.

481
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,433
What do you mean by "protect?"

482
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,900
I mean exactly what I said.

483
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,267
No, don't get the wrong idea.

484
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Minami didn't mean it like that.

485
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:32,667
But...

486
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,467
Oh, my God.

487
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:38,667
My heart keeps pounding!

488
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,933
Where are you, Chiyomi?

489
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:32,800
It's beautiful.

490
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,533
Huh?

491
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,000

EP.08 "BLUE FAIRY"

00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:04,533
Look what I found!

493
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,833
Chiyomi?

494
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:10,300
Don't go, Fairy.

495
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:11,767
Fairy?

496
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:15,733
Thank you and goodbye.

497
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:17,667
Chiyomi!

498
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:20,267
My mommy hates me.

499
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,500
No, she doesn't!

500
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:26,267
Every parent loves their child!

501
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,533
Fairy!

502
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,500
Don't you wanna know
how your mommy feels?
