1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,233
I wanna go back to how it used to be...

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,833
back to when we were little once again...

3
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,367
Minami...

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,133
Chiyomi!

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm over here, Minami!

6
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,567
Tokyo?!

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,933
What is this?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,267
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo!

9
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,100
Let me stay with you, Minami!

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,700
Is it true your father disappeared?

11
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:51,267
He left us for some woman.
He's not my father anymore.

12
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,000
I hate you!

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,900
No way, is that the thief?

14
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:03,667
What happened to your divorce papers?

15
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:04,733
I sent them!

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,567
She said she signed them
when I last called her.

17
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,067
Why won't she file them?

18
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:25,533
What?

19
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,000
Here you go.

20
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:56,200
Wow, the sea breeze feels great!

21
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:07,433
It's been three weeks since
my secret life with Minami started.

22
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:12,700
My feelings for Minami
are growing more than ever.

23
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,733
Stop worrying.

24
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:21,300
Even if someone finds out,
I'll protect you no matter what.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,667
What do you mean by "protect"?

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,233
Exactly as it sounds.

27
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,833
Hey, Minami?

28
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:41,233
How do you really feel about me?

29
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,733
I wanna know.

30
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,000
Minami?

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
What is it?

32
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,633
Nothing.

33
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:49,033
THE BLUE FAIRY

34
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,133
I'm home.

35
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,367
Grandma!

36
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,767
Grandma!

37
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,933
Grandma!

38
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,500
Tomiko!

39
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:13,767
Grandma?

40
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,633
Grandma!

41
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,133
NOMURA HOSPITAL

42
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
I hope she's okay.

43
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,000
Shunichi.

44
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,700
How is she?

45
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,000
She's stable for now.

46
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,633
But she'll be hospitalized
for a full examination.

47
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,733
Can you take this to reception?

48
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,900
Sure.

49
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,067
Hey, I have to go.

50
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,467
Sure.

51
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,500
Wait for me.

52
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,100
Okay.

53
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,567
What?

54
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,900
Ouch!

55
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:25,100
Oh gosh! That hurt!

56
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:31,000
Look what I found!

57
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,733
You are...

58
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,600
Chiyomi?

59
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:10,367
Chiyomi?

60
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:21,400
So, you have no idea
where your sister is?

61
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,033
Unfortunately.

62
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,833
Ouch!

63
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,200
Don't run away, Fairy!

64
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,333
Fairy?

65
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Maybe it has nothing to do with Chobi...

66
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
but I saw a little person too!

67
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,133
What?

68
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:53,733
On the next door's balcony.

69
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,933
Next door? Minami's place?

70
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,067
Yes!

71
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:11,767
I know it's unbelievable, right?

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,533
Maybe I...

73
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,800
Wait. It's possible.

74
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:18,867
You believe me?

75
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,100
I think you saw a doll.

76
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,233
A what?

77
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:30,467
So, Minami can make
a more elaborate doll.

78
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:37,967
Is that your mom?

79
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,933
She seems really sweet.

80
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,633
But Mommy hates me.

81
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:53,133
What?

82
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,267
Mommy!

83
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,267
Miyu, did you tell your doctor
you don't want the surgery?

84
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,067
Can't you see we're all worried
about you?

85
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,467
I wish you'd listen to me for once.

86
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:37,100
If you keep saying no,
you'll never get better.

87
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,500
In here.

88
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,433
Minami!

89
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,533
Hello, she's my mother in law.

90
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,067
This is my son.

91
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Nice to meet you.

92
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,867
Minami! I'm over here.

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,333
Miyu, will you be our granny's
new friend?

94
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,700
Minami, please find me.

95
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,233
Is there anything you need?

96
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,700
All right.

97
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:22,733
I have to get back to work.
See you later, okay?

98
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,567
Honey, pouting won't
make you get any better.

99
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,667
Excuse me.

100
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,267
Have a nice day.

101
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
Emiko?

102
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:51,267
Grandma?

103
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,700
Tomiko, are you awake?

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,467
Yes. Where am I?

105
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,333
You're at the hospital.

106
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,700
Tomiko, you fell ill today.

107
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, yes.
Noboru was there to help me.

108
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:22,367
So, you're staying here
to take a full examination.

109
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,933
I'm sorry to bring this on you.

110
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:31,067
Don't worry about a thing
and get plenty of rest.

111
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Well, aren't you a cute neighbor.

112
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,700
Nice to meet you.

113
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:50,100
I think I'll like it here.

114
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,867
I have the night-shift.
Sorry about dinner.

115
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,867
Yeah.

116
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,033
I have to get back to work.

117
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,333
Alrighty.

118
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,167
I have to go look for something.

119
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,533
No!

120
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,767
Look for what?

121
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,900
Just some stuff.

122
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,933
I'm over here! You're looking for me!

123
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,167
Chiyomi?

124
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,667
Where are you?

125
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,800
Chiyomi?

126
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,667
Chiyomi!

127
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,600
So, your name is One Inch Princess...

128
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes, little lady,
I am the One Inch Princess.

129
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,233
You know...

130
00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:01,967
the One Inch Princess only comes
to those who needs her.

131
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,967
Who need her?

132
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,400
That's right.

133
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,833
She appears only to those
who strive for happiness.

134
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:20,900
So, she will disappear if you tie her down
or be mean to her.

135
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,933
Got it. I'm sorry, Fairy.

136
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,133
You call me a fairy.

137
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:31,100
Yup. You're a fairy to me.

138
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,333
So, you might disappear
because I'm a bad girl.

139
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
You're a good girl.

140
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,867
Nope.

141
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,700
I always do stuff Mommy hates
and I also make her mad!

142
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,733
Mommy doesn't smile because of me.

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,000
That's why I got sick.

144
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,333
-That's not true.
-But it's true!

145
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:05,867
You should show your drawings
to your mommy.

146
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,833
I think you'll make her smile.

147
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,333
But I can't.

148
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,800
Mommy only thinks of me as a bad girl.

149
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,233
She won't like my stupid drawing.

150
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,833
If it wasn't for me,
Mommy could be happier.

151
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,633
Miyu...

152
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,633
That's not true.

153
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:39,533
No mother hates their child...
not one in the entire universe.

154
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,167
You're lying!

155
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,067
I'm not.

156
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:49,767
Every mother loves their child!

157
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,500
Miyu, you love your mother so much...

158
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,967
and you deserve to be happy.

159
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:05,133
Isn't that why you came to her?

160
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,567
Yes, little lady.

161
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,533
Now go to sleep.

162
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,633
Good night.

163
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,600
Good night.

164
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,433
Shoot... I can't get away now...

165
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:36,200
MIYU WAKASUGI
TOMIKO MINAMI

166
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,900
Miyu.

167
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,167
I'm sorry you're suffering.

168
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,600
I'm so sorry.

169
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,067
Minami.

170
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,767
Thank you for everything.

171
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:56,533
But...

172
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,700
it's time to say goodbye.

173
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,900
What do you mean?

174
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,933
I mustn't...

175
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,567
I can no longer live here with you.

176
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,433
I must...

177
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,600
return to the moon.

178
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:21,067
Return to the moon?
Are you kidding me?

179
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,833
Thank you.

180
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,200
And...

181
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,600
goodbye, Minami.

182
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,867
Chiyomi!

183
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:38,833
Hey, wait!

184
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,967
Chiyomi, wait!

185
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,767
Don't go, Chiyomi!

186
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,567
Chiyomi!

187
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,000
Chiyomi!

188
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,800
Chiyomi...

189
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,333
Noboru?

190
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,200
Did you find it?

191
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,267
Grandma.

192
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:34,300
No.

193
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,633
I couldn't.

194
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,833
Could it be...

195
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,900
the One Inch Princess?

196
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:43,867
What?

197
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,167
Your One Inch Princess is right here.

198
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,567
Chiyomi.

199
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:08,967
Minami!

200
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,900
You idiot!

201
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,767
I was worried about you.

202
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
Minami.

203
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,100
Shunichi!

204
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:24,933
Shunichi!

205
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,900
What's up?

206
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,300
I'm off to the hospital to see Tomiko.

207
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,033
I'll go with you.

208
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:42,333
Okay, then I'll buy some cake
and wait for you outside.

209
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:43,333
Okay.

210
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,633
Wake up! We're going to the hospital.

211
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,133
Miyu must be looking for you.

212
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,767
Yeah.

213
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm sorry to take your time.

214
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,533
Not at all. Tomiko is my best friend.

215
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:04,633
Really?

216
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,067
Thank you.

217
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,933
But can grandma eat all these?

218
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:16,533
Those are for the nurses
who are taking care of your grandma.

219
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,100
Of course.

220
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,300
I'm so sorry!

221
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,500
-Let me get you a towel!
-Are you okay?

222
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,733
Here.

223
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,967
Thanks.

224
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,867
You came prepared.

225
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,900
My pants too!

226
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,933
You should go home and change?

227
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,900
I think I will.

228
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,000
It's so cold!

229
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
This sucks!

230
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,700
What?
Shunichi has a cute handkerchief.

231
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,300
Dad, Mom and Asuka. How are you?

232
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,700
This is it.

233
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,500
What does this mean?

234
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:28,967
So, that's what Miyu thinks of
her mom.

235
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:30,667
Yeah.

236
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:36,667
But I know Miyu's mom
is really worried about her.

237
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,667
Because...

238
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm sorry you're suffering.

239
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,633
Hey, Minami?

240
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:53,933
Do you think we can help her?

241
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:58,900
Shunichi?

242
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,267
Asuka?

243
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,533
Who were you talking to?

244
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,900
What?

245
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:15,133
Was I talking to myself again? Oops.

246
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,767
What's that?

247
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,600
What are you hiding? I wanna see it.

248
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,567
It's nothing.

249
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,100
Could it be...

250
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:36,333
Chiyomi?

251
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,333
I knew it.

252
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,667
Hey...

253
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,100
can I see her?

254
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,767
Asuka.

255
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,500
What's going on?

256
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,000
That...

257
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,333
We don't know.

258
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,867
I don't know. No one does.

259
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,500
Are you really Chiyomi?

260
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:28,167
I'm sorry about everything.

261
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:30,467
Don't be.

262
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,067
I should've known sooner. I'm sorry.

263
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:38,833
Asuka.

264
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,933
Hey.

265
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,533
Is there anything I can do for you?

266
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:05,533
Miyu does love her mom very much.

267
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,933
Yup.

268
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:11,467
They're coming.

269
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,433
Here we are.

270
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,833
Stay here until your mommy
comes back, okay?

271
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,300
Hey, Miyu.

272
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,500
Fairy!

273
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,567
I'm here to cast a spell on you.

274
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,067
Don't you wanna know
how your mommy feels?

275
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,767
Hey! Miyu's mom?!

276
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,033
Please come with me!

277
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,400
Miyu!

278
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:24,733
Sweetheart?

279
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,233
Miyu.

280
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,700
She seems much better now.

281
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,767
Miyu was in pain.

282
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,567
I was gonna call the nurse,
but she stopped me.

283
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,533
So I found you instead.

284
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,833
You need to know Mommy
is always here for you.

285
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,800
Miyu was drawing you all day long.

286
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,000
Watermelon at the beach

287
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Miyu and mommy

288
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,300
All of her drawings are of you and Miyu.

289
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:16,367
I love mommy

290
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm sorry, Miyu.

291
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:32,633
I had no idea how you felt...

292
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:35,267
and I...

293
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,533
I couldn't tell you how I really felt.

294
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:44,467
You must've been lonely.

295
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,667
I'm so sorry.

296
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,033
Miyu, I love you more than anything
in the whole world.

297
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,933
I love you very, very much.

298
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,500
So, honey, please...

299
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,067
will you stay with me?

300
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,167
Please...

301
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:12,733
get well soon.

302
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:15,833
Mommy.

303
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
What happened?

304
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,667
Please! Save my daughter!

305
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,333
I beg you!

306
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,867
What happened to Miyu?

307
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,700
I'm not sure, but she was in pain.

308
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,333
Will she be all right?

309
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,600
Doctor, how is she?

310
00:29:57,633 --> 00:29:59,300
Are you happy about something?

311
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,267
What?

312
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,967
I see a big smile.

313
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,733
She's all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

314
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,833
Let me know if you need me.

315
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,500
Yes. Thank you very much.

316
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,433
Doctor!

317
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,000
What is it?

318
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,100
I was thinking...

319
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,267
I'll take the surgery.

320
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:35,933
Miyu!

321
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,400
Let's schedule it later.

322
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:42,900
Yes, please!

323
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,667
What happened?

324
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,233
-We'll beat this thing!
-I can beat it!

325
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,867
Good girl!

326
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,900
Minami, I need to talk to you.

327
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,067
Sayori...

328
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,933
I'm sorry to spring this on you.

329
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:48,433
Not at all.

330
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:52,700
I guess you should know by now
how I feel about...

331
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,933
But I want to clear the air.

332
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,800
If you're turning me down,
I want you to do it now.

333
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,867
You know, I need to make up
my future plan for romance.

334
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,833
Do you...

335
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:20,033
like Chiyomi?

336
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,400
I...

337
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,833
finally realized that...

338
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:44,467
for the longest time...

339
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,833
Chiyomi was always in my heart...

340
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,867
for always.

341
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,267
So...

342
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,500
I'm sorry.

343
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,200
Oh, my God.

344
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:19,533
The most humiliating way
for a refusal ever.

345
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:27,967
Thanks.

346
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,067
I'm gonna leave now.

347
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:45,700
Can you at least watch me
until I'm gone?

348
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:50,633
I will.

349
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,167
That's a mean old lady!

350
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,633
Yeah, I feel sorry for Kotoko.

351
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,167
What in the world are you talking about
with Sayori, Minami?

352
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,867
A little kindness goes a long way.

353
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:45,667
But, you see, that's not Irie's character!

354
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,000
Kanae... was it? How is she?

355
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,267
I owe you an apology.

356
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,400
Don't. It's too late anyway.

357
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:19,967
We're having a baby this October.

358
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,900
I see.

359
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,867
Congratulations.

360
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,200
So, it's time we settle this.

361
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,067
Here.

362
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:39,633
What is that?

363
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,667
The divorce papers you sent me.

364
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:47,400
I saw you here yesterday,
so I brought them just in case.

365
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,433
I'm sorry it took so long.

366
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,167
But I wanted to give this to you
in person.

367
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,100
Bad disguise.

368
00:36:02,933 --> 00:36:06,033
Deception was never your strong suit.

369
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,067
That jerk!

370
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,100
You asshole!

371
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,333
Taizou!

372
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,567
Do you have any idea
what Emiko went through?

373
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,633
Taizou!

374
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:27,033
She worked day and night!

375
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:32,767
She put food on the table
and raised her kid on her own!

376
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,867
Emiko...

377
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,000
Shunichi.

378
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,733
I'm sorry.

379
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,867
I'll take care of my mother from now...

380
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,667
No, you won't.

381
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:15,800
I'm gonna take care
of Mom and grandma.

382
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,600
I made that decision when you left us.

383
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:30,833
I'm sorry. But Tomiko is our family.

384
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,067
I understand.

385
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:42,533
Shunichi, take good care of them.

386
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,667
I don't need you to tell me.

387
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:53,867
And...

388
00:37:55,433 --> 00:38:01,767
Shunichi, don't give up on kendo.
You still got a score to settle.

389
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:25,733
You better make her happy
this time around.

390
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,600
Oh, my! How could this be?

391
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:44,500
We gotta cheer for Irie.

392
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:52,500
Minami!

393
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:56,633
Is Sayori your girlfriend now?

394
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,500
Grandma, I'm taking off.

395
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:10,967
Thanks for coming by.

396
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,767
I think I'm gonna stay awhile.

397
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,733
Hey, come on, Princess.

398
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,467
Yeah.

399
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,600
Fairy?

400
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,133
Thank you for the magic!

401
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:48,633
You're most welcome.

402
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,233
See you later.

403
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,467
What?

404
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:27,900
What is it, Minami?

405
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Don't...

406
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,267
Don't you go away.

407
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,433
Because...

408
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,333
this is where you belong.

409
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,000
What? What did you just say?

410
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,400
Nothing.

411
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:53,500
Forget it.

412
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:02,300

413
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:03,200
This is Chiyomi?

414
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:05,700
I heard she's an online novelist.

415
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:08,200
Now he knows!

416
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,567
Minami can't read it!

417
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:13,500
Mom is gonna file
a missing person's report!

418
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,000
I know you're the giant!

The One Inch Princess went
to Cape Akebono and grew back.

420
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,033
It's like a secret love affair!

421
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,300
Oh, God, please grow me back!
