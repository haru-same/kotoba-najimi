1
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:33,533
I won't take the exams!
I know what I want!

2
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,133
You're a spoiled brat.

3
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,567
I wanna go back
to when it used to be,

4
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,967
back to when we were little
once again...

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,267
Minami...

6
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,667
Chiyomi!

7
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,633
I'm over here Minami!

8
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,267
I heard Chiyomi is missing?

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,033
Tokyo?!

10
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:12,000
What is this?

11
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:16,200
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo!

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,167
So please!

13
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,533
Let me stay with you Minami!

14
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,167
Wait. How does that happen?

15
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:51,233
Princess... please wake up.

16
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,467
What is the matter?

17
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,567
The prince of the near kingdom!

18
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,600
Our precious princess...

19
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:06,300
she has fallen to her death
from the witch's evil spell.

20
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,633
How heartrending...

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,500
What a beautiful princess.

22
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,400
How could such beauty ever cease?

23
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,633
Please accept my love...

24
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,500
and breathe once again, my love.

25
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:55,500
The wicked spell is broken!

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,267
The princess is alive again!

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,133
My prince...

28
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,000
Hooray!

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,233
You saved me from death.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,467
Yes, my love.

31
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,433
My beautiful princess.

32
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,367
Will you...

33
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,100
marry me?

34
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:29,500
Yes!

35
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,633
The prince's kiss has broken the curse,

36
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,600
and they lived...

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,800
happily ever after!

38
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,133
This thing won't dry.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,567
Do you think a prince's kiss
will magically grow me back?

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,567
How does that work?

41
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,500
You're no princess either.

42
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,633
So... who's your prince?

43
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,533
No one... in particular...

44
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,267
Is it Riku? Riku Takagi?

45
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:17,800
He loves you, right?

46
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,733
I know you're over the moon by that,

47
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,467
but shouldn't you try to find
a realistic solution?

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,067
I'm not over the moon!
I'm seriously...

49
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,767
Don't look at me!

50
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,033
A MAGICAL LOVE MALLET

51
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,767
Thank you for coming.

52
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:31,133
Chiyomi is such a troublemaker.

53
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,833
Old photos, weren't it?

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,100
Yes, I know it's early
in the school year,

55
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:42,100
but we want baby pictures
for our yearbook...

56
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,700
I found it. Here you go.

57
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:48,867
Chiyomi should pick it,
but we need by tomorrow.

58
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,667
I'm sorry. We can't even reach her.

59
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,333
Hello? Can I order?

60
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,267
Yes! I'll be right down!

61
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,367
I'll choose for her.

62
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,200
Thanks. The cafe is really busy.

63
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,533
Do you see it?

64
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,433
Is this it?

65
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,433
That's the one!

66
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:22,233
Now I have actual clothes to wear!

67
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,267
Shunichi!

68
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,733
Shunichi?

69
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29,500
Shoot!

70
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,967
Welcome Shunichi!

71
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,833
-Asuka...
-So happy to see you!

72
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,633
What's up?

73
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:52,700
I had to get Chiyomi's
pictures for our yearbook.

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,433
My sister's pictures are all the same!

75
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,233
They're all identical!

76
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,467
You're right.

77
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,233
Look at this one.

78
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,933
THE FOLLOWING DAY

79
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:11,733
Hop on.

80
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,267
I like it in here.

81
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,467
Sei Shonagon and Murasaki Shikibu
are most important female writers...

82
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,967
their works are invaluable.

83
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:44,867
"Classical Literature"

84
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,500
The Tale of Genji...

85
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,767
It's great to be back in school.

86
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,500
Sei Shonagon has not
written about Murasaki Shikibu,

87
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:05,267
but Murasaki Shikibu has left
severe critique about Sei Shonagon.

88
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:09,433
They both had unique artistry.

89
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,067
Life goes on without me...

90
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,200
That's all for today.

91
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
-How's this?
-Something more normal.

92
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:52,733
How would I know what's normal?

93
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,833
How about...

94
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,567
-This?
-Not pretty!

95
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,867
-This?
-Weird.

96
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,933
How about this one?

97
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,167
Cute!

98
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
Good.

99
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,233
Creep.

100
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
It's delicious!

101
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,533
Don't get it on me.

102
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,367
It's not bad being small now.
I can eat lots of ice cream!

103
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,800
I envy your optimism.

104
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,900
Sorry.

105
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,167
It's been four days.

106
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:21,967
Any changes?

107
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,667
I don't know.

108
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,400
All right...

109
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,300
Yeah.

110
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,367
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,033
Hurry up and eat.

112
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,500
What?

113
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,067
Nothing.

114
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,500
One Inch Princess.

115
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,233
One Inch Princess?

116
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:05,533
Yes. Our old legend has it,

117
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,667
about a small princess just
like the One Inch Samurai.

118
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,667
A tiny princess? I wanna see!

119
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,267
But in the end, she grows back.

120
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,733
She gets married
and has many children...

121
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,400
and became our guardian angel.

122
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,033
How did she grow back?

123
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:37,533
She waved a magical mallet
on a full moon night and grew back.

124
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,067
A magical mallet!

125
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:42,467
What?

126
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,733
Wait.

127
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,167
No, no, no.

128
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,400
Minami?

129
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,333
What are you doing here?

130
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:05,600
You rushed out of the classroom
to eat an ice cream all by yourself?

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're actually adorable.

132
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,133
That has to be it...

133
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:16,900
Can I have a taste?

134
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,100
Oh, my God!

135
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,433
Sayori?

136
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,333
Sorry, I gotta go!

137
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,900
Wa... wait!

138
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,333
Unacceptable!

139
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,333
Sayori?

140
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,367
You disappeared on me!

141
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,667
Masaya...

142
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,067
What happened?

143
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,433
Nothing!

144
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,033
You wanted ice cream?

145
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,467
-No!
-Of course.

146
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:47,033
So it's true Pheromone
has a golfer boyfriend.

147
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,267
Minami!

148
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:57,367
My grandma said this shrine
enshrines a magical mallet.

149
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,700
I've seen it.

150
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,367
It's displayed only during
the festival for its good luck.

151
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,833
What was it?

152
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,067
You wave the mallet under
the full moon and make a wish?

153
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:15,567
Yup!

154
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,933
Where can we get in?

155
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,967
Minami?

156
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,000
What?

157
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,967
I can get in from there, right?

158
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,133
I'm off.

159
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,467
Be careful.

160
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,767
Minami. Over here!

161
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,733
Come over here!

162
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,067
Being tiny has its perks.

163
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,233
I know!

164
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,167
So this is the magical mallet?

165
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,033
No way!

166
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,433
Please... please, grow me back.

167
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,567
Please!

168
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,900
Oh, my God!

169
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,700
I can finally go back!

170
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:00,433
Back to my life! How I used to be!

171
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,533
I can't stand you anymore!

172
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,000
What?

173
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,333
Why?

174
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:29,433
It didn't work.

175
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,333
No way...

176
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:38,967
The mallet was glowing!
I knew it was gonna work...

177
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,267
Over there!

178
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,300
Shit! Come on.

179
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Stop! Thief!

180
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,033
Wait? Is that you, Shunichi?

181
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,267
Under pressure, huh?

182
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,733
Not really...

183
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,133
I see.

184
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,733
Maybe you should take it easy.

185
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,700
Ms. Oono said you can get into
any med-school you want.

186
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:25,733
I'm sorry, I did something weird.

187
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm actually relieved.

188
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:38,367
I thought you'd never ask
for help, let alone God.

189
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,367
But you're still very sweet.

190
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,800
You know, it's okay to complain.

191
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:55,533
You can choose any college you want.

192
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,300
What?

193
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,400
You're trying to get a scholarship?

194
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,100
You knew?

195
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:10,033
I heard from the chief.
His daughter told him.

196
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:14,767
Yeah...

197
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,967
I know we're not rich.

198
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:26,033
I also know how hard you're studying.

199
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:33,000
You work hard to protect
me and your grandmother.

200
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,700
So let me help you.

201
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:47,933
Minami...

202
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,233
Shunichi.

203
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:58,333
You can go to any school you want.

204
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,700
Trust me, will you?

205
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,633
I can afford your education.
It's easy-peasy lemon squeezy!

206
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,033
Got it?

207
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,467
Easy-peasy...?

208
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,767
Another storm is coming.

209
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:30,400
Grandma is away tonight.
Let's order some pizza?

210
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,700
-Sure.
-Let's hurry.

211
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,300
I'm sorry.

212
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,867
It's all my fault.

213
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,667
You didn't have a choice.

214
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,167
Minami?

215
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:04,200
You turned small on
a stormy night right?

216
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,500
Yeah.

217
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,933
Good!

218
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,900
Let's do something stupid again.

219
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,433
What?

220
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,633
This is where you turned.

221
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,633
You blacked out
and woke up tiny, right?

222
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,433
I got it!

223
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,467
If I do the same thing again...

224
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
that could work!

225
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,733
These are yours.

226
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,733
You washed them?

227
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,200
I couldn't leave it be.

228
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,233
Thanks.

229
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,100
I'll come back for you in the morning.

230
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,367
Wa... wait!

231
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,200
You're leaving?

232
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,867
You were alone that night?

233
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,567
But...

234
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,733
all alone on a stormy night?

235
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm tiny. I'll die before I grow back!

236
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:27,800
A fairy loses its magic
when it falls in love.

237
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,733
The fairy also loses its smile...

238
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,633
and ages very quickly.

239
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Soon, it will fall into
an eternal slumber.

240
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:49,133
But when that love is reciprocated,

241
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:54,400
the fairy will turn into a human
in exchange for its magic.

242
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:59,733
Humans age, but they can smile.

243
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,467
In the short time of their life,

244
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,167
they feel joy, pain, anger and sadness.

245
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,167
"Updated : 1 week ago"

246
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,067
Chris hesitated.

247
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,833
Could this be love?

248
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,200
If so... if that were true,
she is yet to understand.

249
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,367
Her own doubt...

250
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,900
her doubt is already
the beginning of love...

251
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,167
No update again.

252
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:44,933
Chiyomi, I hope she's fine.

253
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,533
Morning?

254
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,567
It came so fast.

255
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,933
I grew back!

256
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,300
Yes!!

257
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,067
Where's Minami?

258
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,633
Minami look at me! We did it!

259
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,667
Thank you.

260
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:11,933
You did it.

261
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:18,967
I'm happy too.

262
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,700
Hey! Stop that!

263
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,467
Gosh, stop!

264
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,133
This sucks...

265
00:27:58,733 --> 00:27:59,833
A dream?

266
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,467
It didn't work.

267
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,333
Hey, are you all right?

268
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,067
Minami?

269
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:55,567
I guess it didn't work...

270
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,000
Are you all right?

271
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
I'm an idiot.

272
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,467
I think I caught a cold.

273
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,500
You're burning up!

274
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,833
No one's home.
What am I gonna do?

275
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,600
I need to cool him down!

276
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,400
Finally.

277
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,333
Chiyomi?

278
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,700
I couldn't get you anything.

279
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,600
Water...

280
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,800
ice... nothing.

281
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:04,067
It took me everything to get here...

282
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:07,100
I'm so sorry.

283
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,867
Just stay here with me.

284
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:32,400
"In times past,
lived an old bamboo cutter.

285
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:37,200
A master of all dealings of the bamboo.

286
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,833
His name Sanuki no Miyatsuko.

287
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:45,067
Upon approaching
the shining bamboo."

288
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:51,000
He's burning up.

289
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,067
I wish I could cool him down.

290
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,733
Sorry, did I wake you?

291
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:06,233
No...

292
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,333
How do you feel?

293
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,367
Groggy...

294
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,867
The worst timing...

295
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,633
Are you okay? Can you walk?

296
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:32,867
I'll be fine.

297
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,667
Are you hungry?

298
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:43,400
Just a bit.

299
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
I'll get you something.

300
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:51,067
Thanks for always taking care of me.

301
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:54,533
You owe me a lot.

302
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,167
Hello?

303
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,067
Hey, darling!

304
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,300
Hello!

305
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,767
-Beautiful home.
-Nice and new.

306
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
Are you home alone?

307
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,333
Yes.

308
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:27,600
Our timing is impeccable. Here!

309
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:31,433
We brought you
something for your cold.

310
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,167
We got udon noodles for you,

311
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,500
and for us...

312
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,833
I don't want it.

313
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,700
Why not? You should eat something.

314
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,267
I'm not hungry.

315
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:52,500
Well, there is another thing
I wanted to do here today...

316
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,133
I quit kendo.

317
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,233
Think it over...

318
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,900
I've made my decision.

319
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,133
Be that as it may,

320
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,933
I'm here to tell you how
talented you are at kendo.

321
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,433
No, thank you.

322
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,567
It's like talking to a wall.

323
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,800
Come on. Listen to him!

324
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,467
Cut it out!

325
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,867
Can you please leave?

326
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,633
Let's talk about this...

327
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,000
Never.

328
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:36,267
Okay. Let's get going, shall we?

329
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,633
Yes, coach!

330
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,300
Whatever's bothering you,
I'm here for you, man.

331
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:50,733
Sure.

332
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:59,033
Enjoy some real girls for a change.

333
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,833
See you tomorrow.

334
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,700
Excuse us!

335
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:26,967
I borrowed your tablet.

336
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,333
I learned how to bring down
your fever.

337
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:41,833
It said to cool your armpits...

338
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,767
I know.

339
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:47,000
Of course.

340
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,500
My mom is a nurse.

341
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:54,467
Oh, yeah... figures.

342
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,700
Thanks.

343
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:03,967
I'm sorry.

344
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm really, really sorry about this.

345
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,933
I made you catch a cold.

346
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,067
Don't worry.
I did it on my own free will.

347
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,267
Those goons!

348
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,900
Leave me alone!

349
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,333
Are you sure?

350
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:39,533
Yeah.

351
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,367
I forgot to lock the door.

352
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,167
Hello?

353
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:51,933
Minami?

354
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,267
Sayori?

355
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,067
Hide!

356
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,167
Minami?

357
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,167
Where are you?

358
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,833
I'm here.

359
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,033
Sayori?

360
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,667
Hey.

361
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:23,333
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

362
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:27,300
It's fine. But why?

363
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,167
I was worried, I heard you were sick.

364
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,267
Okay... thanks.

365
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,500
How are you?

366
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:46,533
A little dizzy, I guess?

367
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,300
What is this?

368
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,467
Yeah, I wasn't that hungry.

369
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,167
How is it?

370
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:15,800
Great.

371
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,567
Really? I'm glad.

372
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,767
That was delicious, thanks.

373
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I'd cook for you any time.

374
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,967
Minami?

375
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:52,467
Your fever!
I should've paid more attention.

376
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,600
Go back to sleep.

377
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,833
Thanks.

378
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:02,267
I'll be right back.

379
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:10,800
Minami...

380
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,867
Sorry.

381
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,700
Don't mention it.

382
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,567
I'm sorry, Minami.

383
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:15,867
There's nothing I could do for you.

384
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:50,467
Don't! Stop!

385
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:53,367
Minami...!

386
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,533
Please, no!

387
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:02,967
NEXT EPISODE
EP.04 "DON'T GIVE UP, MINAMI"

388
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:05,067
Damn it! Why should I?

389
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,333
I'm begging you.

390
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:08,900
Our team could be eliminated!

391
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,100
I know you want to.

392
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,733
You love kendo!

393
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:17,433
Is it true your father disappeared?

394
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,000
Same here.
My so-called mother left me.

395
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:24,567
Mom, don't you resent him?

396
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,500
Don't give up, Minami!

397
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:31,500
