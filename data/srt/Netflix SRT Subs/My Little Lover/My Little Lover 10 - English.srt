1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,700
Take care of Chiyomi, all right?

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,033
Yeah.

3
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,467
You know...

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,400
according to the original legend,
you need more than a mallet.

5
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,167
The old book said, after she
used the magical mallet,

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:34,333
the Princess went
to Cape Akebono and grew back.

7
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,400
Cape Akebono?

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,867
Give it a try.

9
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,433
Please...

10
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:03,100
Please grow me back!

11
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,500
Please...

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,633
Please grow Chiyomi back.

13
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:20,267
The day is here.
I can finally grow back!

14
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,100
Chiyomi!

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,033
I'm over here, Minami!

16
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:31,267
Ever since the day the boy I loved
came to my rescue...

17
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:39,333
I've felt every joy and heartache
of being with someone I love.

18
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:49,267
The Minami I love is not a chicken!

19
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,700
What about you?

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,200
You can't do anything on your own!

21
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,133
He's burning up.

22
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:06,267
At times I felt powerless...

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,900
I felt helpless.

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,100
A lot has happened.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,933
You love Chobi!

26
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,267
Chiyomi, you're the one!

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,533
Your love is not one-sided!

28
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:28,500
You're already a part of me!

29
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,300
Minami!

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,100
I finally know that our feelings
were mutual.

31
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,400
Now our hearts beat as one.

32
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,467
I wanna grow back for him.

33
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,333
GOOD-BYE CHIYOMI, GOOD-BYE MINAMI

34
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,067
Why?

35
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:40,800
Will I stay like this forever?

36
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,300
Don't worry!

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,567
There has to be another way.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,833
But I don't know what else I can do.

39
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:03,567
It's gonna be all right.
You can count on me.

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Minami.

41
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,967
But...

42
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:19,033
Riku was so sure this would work,
but look at this.

43
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you for coming.

44
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Thank you.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,967
Thank you for coming.

46
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,000
All right.

47
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,533
We came all this way.

48
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:11,467
How about we lodge here
for one more night?

49
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,067
He won't go home yet, will he?

50
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,967
Take care of Chiyomi, all right?

51
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:37,900
Yeah.

52
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:42,767
The old book said, after she
used the magical mallet...

53
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:47,200
the Princess went to Cape Akebono
and grew back.

54
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,267
Cape Akebono?

55
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,033
Give it a try.

56
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:57,833
He must be dating Chiyomi
and they will meet up.

57
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,267
Chiyomi?

58
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,867
Do you have any requests?

59
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,333
Yeah.

60
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,533
Where should we go?

61
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,667
Can you...

62
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,333
please take me home?

63
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:17,867
Home?

64
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,033
Not your home...

65
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,600
but my home.

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,133
Chiyomi?

67
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:36,233
I'll tell my parents about everything
that's happened.

68
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:41,900
Wait a minute. We don't know
if you can't grow back yet.

69
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,467
I can't be your burden like this.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,833
Don't worry about me,
and you are not a burden.

71
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,433
Minami.

72
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,233
Is he okay? He's been
talking to himself a lot.

73
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,633
I think...

74
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,733
we need to forget about each other.

75
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,767
Let's make it like...

76
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,133
this all never happened.

77
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:25,767
Don't say that!
There's no way I can do that!

78
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,333
You'll never be happy
stuck with me like this!

79
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,033
I can't do anything for you.

80
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,867
Don't! I wanna stay with you.

81
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,233
But I can't!

82
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,233
I can't stand being your burden.

83
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,067
You'll regret it one day.

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,300
I'll regret if I leave you!

85
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
I know...

86
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,333
I'll protect you no matter what.

87
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,333
I won't leave you.

88
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,533
Minami.

89
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,833
I love you.

90
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,700
Stay with me!

91
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,633
We need to end this.

93
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,900
Minami!

94
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,467
Chiyomi.

95
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,600
Shit!

96
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,067
He's not moving.

97
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,333
Ouch...

98
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,700
What are we gonna do?

99
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,833
Shit!

100
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,833
Shut up! How the hell would I know?

101
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,067
Let's get outta here!

102
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,167
Minami?

103
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:05,767
Minami!

104
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,167
Wa-- Wait!

105
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,733
Minami!

106
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,867
Minami!

107
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,733
Stay with me! Please!

108
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,733
Minami?

109
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,233
Minami? Answer me please!

110
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,567
Minami!

111
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,167
Chiyomi?

112
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,267
Mom?!

113
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,533
Mom...

114
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:57,333
We gotta help him...!

115
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:03,667
What if Chiyomi transformed
into a little person too?

116
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,033
Mom!

117
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,667
Minami is not waking up!

118
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,833
What do we do?

119
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,467
Calm down!

120
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:23,567
Panicking won't help him!
We need to stay calm.

121
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,333
Hello? There has been an accident!

122
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,133
Come quickly!

123
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,633
NOMURA HOSPITAL

124
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,233
Doctor! How is he?

125
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,033
Will he be all right?

126
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:58,367
The operation was a success.
Bleeding in his brain is contained.

127
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:02,600
I don't see other trauma,
so let's wait and see.

128
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,933
I assume side-effects are unlikely.

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,733
Thank you, Doctor Kawamura!

130
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,867
Thank you so much.

131
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,533
So, he's your son.

132
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,833
He's young, he'll heal fast.

133
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,067
Thank you.

134
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,467
Excuse me.

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Thank you again.

136
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,067
That was great news!

137
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,067
Minami...

138
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,167
I'm so happy.

139
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,200
We're home.

140
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,233
I'm home!

141
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,667
Chiyomi! Where is she?

142
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
In here.

143
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,967
In what?

144
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,767
Dad?

145
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,733
I'm home.

146
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm sorry about everything.

147
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,633
It's Chiyomi.

148
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,400
I see...

149
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,633
Asuka, why didn't you tell us
if you knew about this?

150
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,000
I mentioned it the other day!

151
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,400
I thought you were joking!

152
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,700
But you'd never believe me!

153
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,767
Even so...

154
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,233
What's done is done!

155
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,700
What matters is that she's home.

156
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,000
Dad...

157
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,733
She's so tiny and cute!

158
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,267
Welcome home, Chiyomi.

159
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,567
Welcome home.

160
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm happy for you, sis.

161
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,900
I'm home.

162
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,133
He doesn't seem to be waking up.

163
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:43,600
He just had surgery,
but is this an expected?

164
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,533
Anesthesia should be wearing off.

165
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,200
He should be conscious by now.

166
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,933
We were so adorable!

167
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:03,767
Chiyomi?

168
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,067
-Chiyomi!
-What is it?

169
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,867
I heard Minami is still unconscious.

170
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,467
What?!

171
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,367
Daddy...

172
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,833
How could this happen?

173
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,000
Ritsuko! Thanks for coming.

174
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,767
Minami.

175
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,567
Why?

176
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,833
He should be awake by now.

177
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,667
But his prolonged coma...

178
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,867
is apparently abnormal.

179
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,133
I thought he was recovering...

180
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,900
The doctor said he may never wake up.

181
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,333
No way!

182
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,467
Daddy!

183
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,367
Mrs. Minami? The doctor
would like to speak to you.

184
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,633
Of course.

185
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:36,267
Ritsuko, can you stay
with him for a while?

186
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,600
-I'm going.
-I'm coming with you too.

187
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,467
Minami.

188
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,333
Mom?

189
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,133
Just for a while...

190
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,400
can we have a moment alone?

191
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,033
Minami?

192
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,233
Wake up.

193
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,967
Please open your eyes.

194
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,533
Please!

195
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,233
I'm so sorry, Minami.

196
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:20,233
I was only thinking of myself.

197
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,300
Even if I can't grow back...

198
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:31,133
I was happy to be by your side.

199
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,633
I'll never leave you again.

200
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,433
Even if you never wake up...

201
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,367
I love you, Minami.

202
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:15,100
You and me together forever!

203
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,433
Minami.

204
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:12,633
Minami!

205
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,000
Chiyomi?

206
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,767
Yeah.

207
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,900
It's me.

208
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,800
Can you see?

209
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,833
Good... you're safe.

210
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,367
Minami.

211
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,667
Thank God.

212
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,933
I'm glad.

213
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:49,167
Chiyomi?

214
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,067
Minami.

215
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:09,133
Minami... Look, I...

216
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,033
Chiyomi.

217
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,700
Yes, Minami.

218
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,100
-Chiyomi!
-Yes!

219
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,167
Chiyomi!

220
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:21,467
Yes!

221
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,500
Can you put something on?

222
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,867
Don't look!

223
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,133
Wait a sec!

224
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,400
I won't.

225
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,967
I'm okay now.

226
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,033
It's impossible.

227
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,600
The kiss...

228
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,467
Do you think a prince's kiss
will magically grow me back?

229
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,667
How does that work?

230
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,333
Darn it.

231
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,400
My plan backfired.

232
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,533
What?

233
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,033
I should've kissed you.

234
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,700
We can as much as we want.

235
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,600
Chiyomi, they're back...

236
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,167
Shunichi?

237
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,433
Chiyomi?

238
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Oh, my!

239
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:29,300
Hey, it's Chiyomi!

240
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,067
Chiyomi!

241
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,633
-Where have you been?
-We were worried!

242
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,933
I was on a mission.

243
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:43,033
What? A mission... seriously?

244
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,133
Minami! Are you all right?

245
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,433
I'm all better.

246
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,233
Don't run off like that.
I'm still kind of weak.

247
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,300
Oops, I won't do it again!

248
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,600
You...

249
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,067
What?

250
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,600
What is this vibe?

251
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,600
Why are you two talking?

252
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,533
Didn't they hate each other?

253
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,033
Wait, while Chiyomi was away...

254
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,700
Did you and Minami...?

255
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,200
Yeah. We're dating now.

256
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,600
Hey! Minami!

257
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,300
Why not? We should be open.

258
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:32,833
Ami...

259
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,000
Ami!

260
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,933
I'm sorry...

261
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,533
I left you behind.

262
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:44,800
How could you?

263
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,600
I was worried to death!

264
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:52,500
Ami... I'm so sorry.

265
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,667
I'm sorry!

266
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:17,567
Let's do this!

267
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:23,733
This is Chiyomi's choreography.

268
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:26,200
The tournament is in a month!

269
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,267
We're gonna dance till we drop!

270
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,533
Yuka, music please!

271
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,500
Okay! Here we go!

272
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,567
Chiyomi! Minami!

273
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,867
Congratulations!

274
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,333
Thank you.

275
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:25,833
The bride was also a member
of this dance team last season!

276
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,433
That's right!

277
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,433
We got married right after
our high school graduation!

278
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:41,633
Chiyomi also danced that routine,

279
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,767
and won the dance tournament
last year!

280
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,233
Next up, the dance team member,

281
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,133
and the next captain, Yuka Ueno!

282
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:59,133
She wrote a song for the happy couple!

283
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,833
Take it away Yuka!

284
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,567
Yes! We get to hear Yuka sing!

285
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,833
Congratulations on your marriage!

286
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,467
I'll sing a song for your happy future.

287
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:15,933
Please enjoy.

288
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,133
"Just by your side"

289
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:38,667
Our small encounter

290
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:44,033
Led me to this big beginning

291
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,400
The days we spent together

292
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:57,733
I slowly cherished my love for you

293
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:05,333
Snuggled next to you
We walk side by side

294
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:10,333
It's like the moon in the sky

295
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:17,100
Though we may seem close
My outstretched arms

296
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,133
I can never reach you

297
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:28,033
I just love you
I always think of you

298
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:33,600
So much my heart aches
Longing for you for eternity

299
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:40,033
I just wanna be honest
And tell you that I love you

300
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:44,867
So forever and ever

301
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,233
Be by my side

302
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,367
She's so talented, huh?

303
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
She is.

304
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:06,700
We've finally come this far.

305
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:09,967
It still feels like a dream.

306
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,933
Really?

307
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,033
What about you?

308
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,433
Me?

309
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:24,433
I've never thought of marrying
anyone but you.

310
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,900
Stop crying and get a grip already.

311
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:46,300
You've been crying all day.

312
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,967
But, honey...

313
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:52,500
everything gets in my eyes
when I recall her.

314
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,967
She was just a little girl.

315
00:32:56,667 --> 00:33:01,600
She was literally teeny tiny
last year.

316
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,533
You're beautiful.

317
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,700
Shoot. It's coming back
in my eyes again...

318
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh, honey. Here, here.

319
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:36,367
I've always thought those two
would be together someday.

320
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,333
Me too.

321
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,633
So cute! Is it a boy or a girl?

322
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,700
It's a boy!

323
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,300
Did you hear that? So precious!

324
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,167
Is she a pretty bride?

325
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,033
So, will you two be next?

326
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:58,667
What?

327
00:33:58,767 --> 00:33:59,933
Sayori?

328
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,533
Oddly you make a good couple.

329
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,667
Sayori.

330
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,467
Huh? What do you mean by oddly?

331
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:14,833
Here we go! Say cheese fondue!

332
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:16,933
Thanks.

333
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,033
Let's see.

334
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,433
You look really cute!

335
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:21,667
Really?

336
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm good huh?

337
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,800
Me too! I want a picture with you!

338
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,267
Sure.

339
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:32,967
Riku? Can I call you my brother?

340
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,400
Big brother!

341
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,433
Asuka?

342
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:41,633
Hey, isn't your brother over there?

343
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,100
Riku, let's take another!

344
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:46,633
-No it's my turn!
-Riku, me too!

345
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,267
I should've taken a picture of Chiyomi
when she was tiny.

346
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,233
It's too late now.

347
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,033
We have one.

348
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:04,900
See?

349
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,700
It's Chiyomi!

350
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,333
See, it's you!

351
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,700
I know! I was in it too!

352
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,200
There you are.

353
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:34,400
Today marks exactly one year
since the day I turned tiny.

354
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm off.

355
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,200
Okay.

356
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,300
Are you ready?
Did you finish packing?

357
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:50,333
I forgot my tracksuit and shoes!

358
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:54,167
You can't go without those!

359
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:01,033
Minami was accepted
to a med school nearby.

360
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,367
He's a med student now.

361
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:11,667
I moved in with Minami...
which is next door, you know.

362
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,233
We're in our honeymoon phase.

363
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:17,433
I can't stand two weeks
away from you.

364
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,933
Or so I thought.

365
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:24,733
Today I'm heading to the audition
I missed last year.

366
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,600
So, I'm off to Tokyo!

367
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:31,167
You're gonna be
a writer and a dancer?

368
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:33,633
Yeah.

369
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:41,100
I'll go when I finish this.

370
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,500
Is it almost done?

371
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,467
I'm writing the climax.

372
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:47,500
Climax?

373
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:22,867
The giant led Chobi to a special place.

374
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,000
That is...

375
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,967
Be careful.

376
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:51,233
Oh, my gosh, hard to believe
all this happened recently.

377
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,867
Yeah.

378
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,500
It reminds me of when I was tiny.

379
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,300
Is that all you remember?

380
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:06,633
What?

381
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,033
It's not the best crown.

382
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,367
Chiyomi?

383
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,733
I love you.

384
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,733
I want to be with you.

385
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,200
Marry me?

386
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:14,967
Burying her face into his chest,
she heard the sound she once heard.

387
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,833
Chiyomi.

388
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,000
Look!

389
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:56,533
They gazed over the rainbow.

390
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,400
It was the same rainbow
they saw together as children.

391
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,267
The rainbow we saw...

392
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:10,433
may have been an arch to our future.

393
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:26,100
Chobi... is no longer in his pocket.

394
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:31,633
