1
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:09,833
I wanna go back to how it used to be...

2
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,800
back to when we were little.

3
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,300
Minami.

4
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,133
Chiyomi!

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,867
I'm over here, Minami!

6
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,633
Tokyo?!

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,933
What is this?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,100
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo!

9
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,433
So, please...

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,400
let me stay with you, Minami!

11
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:51,600
You blacked out and woke up tiny, right?

12
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,733
I got it! If I do the same thing again...

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,533
It didn't work.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,133
Are you all right?

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,933
I'm an idiot. I think I caught a cold.

16
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,833
Hello?

17
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:14,867
Sayori?

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,900
Dad, Mom and Asuka...

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,600
how are you?

20
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,933
I'm doing well... in To...

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,400
Tokyo! I'm doing well in Tokyo.

22
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,700
No, that was bad.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,567
It's obvious you're lying.

24
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,700
I got nervous.

25
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:46,633
Take two.

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,333
Dad, Mom and Asuka, how are you?

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,567
I'm doing great in Tokyo!

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,233
I know you're worried about me,
but I'm fine. Talk to you soon!

29
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,100
Good.

30
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:13,867
We got it.

31
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,900
There's nothing weird on the screen.

32
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:21,400
It's been about a week since
my strange transformation.

33
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,867
I have no idea when I'll grow back.

34
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:30,567
Hey, no one will know
you're sending it right?

35
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:31,467
Yeah.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,633
I made a different account for this.

37
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:42,500
Minami and I used to be best friends,
but somehow we drifted apart.

38
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,500
I thought our friendship was lost.

39
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,133
Enter your dad's address?

40
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:56,133
But it was Minami who
found me in my crisis.

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,533
H-A-N-A...

42
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,000
This is tricky.

43
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:11,300
Do... ro... bo... @...

44
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,967
...ne. jp.

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,867
Send.

46
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:26,833
Great.

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,233
Unable to go home to my family
and friends in my bizarre state...

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,067
I'm living as Minami's secret roommate.

49
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,733
Dad, Mom and Asuka, how are you?

50
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,400
DON'T GIVE UP, MINAMI

51
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:33,633
It's Chiyomi! Look honey!

52
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,167
"How are you?"
I've aged so much thanks to you!

53
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,067
Keep quiet!

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,633
I know you're worried about me,
but I'm fine. Talk to you soon!

55
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,633
What? Was that it?

56
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,333
What?!

57
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,533
What is that ugly dress she's wearing?

58
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,333
That's not what we wanted to know!

59
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,567
Hey, but at least we know she's fine.

60
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,167
This is frustrating!

61
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,400
What is that ugly bow?

62
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,667
All she needs to do is call us!

63
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,033
Maybe she's scared of you both?

64
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,100
Remember, it was you who slapped her.

65
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,100
That's abuse, Daddy!

66
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:23,667
Hey! That's not what happened.

67
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,833
You remember, don't you?

68
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:28,733
This is Horikiri.

69
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,533
Chiyomi?

70
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,367
Chiyomi? Give it here.

71
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,833
Hey! Chiyomi?

72
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Yeah. Did you see the video I sent you?

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,767
We did. What are you doing, Chiyomi?

74
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,767
I told you, the audition workshop.

75
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,733
For how long? You should be home by now!

76
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:51,800
There's been a hold up.

77
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:55,400
They're real artists you know.

78
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,233
Artists?

79
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,600
Chiyomi? Where's your cell phone?

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,433
It broke.

81
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,567
Then get a new one.

82
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:06,867
I'm broke.

83
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,133
I'll send some money. Tell me the address.

84
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:17,700
I need to concentrate on dancing.
So, I wanna be in solitude for now.

85
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,100
What are you, the Karate Kid?

86
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,133
Just trust me.

87
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,900
I'm at a pay phone. No more coins!

88
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,833
Chiyomi?

89
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,900
I'm out of change!

90
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,667
Chiyomi? Chiyomi?

91
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,700
How can you lie like that?

92
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,767
I know it's bad.

93
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,633
But... it's better than the truth.

94
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:57,133
How can I go back... looking like this?

95
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,900
You wanna be in solitude, huh?

96
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,633
What?

97
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,467
You pinhead!

98
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,100
Take that back!

99
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,367
Don't take it out on the sick.

100
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,933
I'm not... taking it out on you.

101
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:27,467
Minami got sick yesterday.

102
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,633
Don't. Stop!

103
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:01,567
Minami!

104
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,600
Please, no!

105
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:08,867
Chiyomi.

106
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:17,733
Chiyomi.

107
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:40,467
You've got me into a mess, you pinhead!

108
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,200
Minami?

109
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,633
Pinhead!

110
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:58,767
He's sleep-talking?

111
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,100
What?

112
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,367
Today's absent is Chiyomi.

113
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,067
Take care of yourselves
and be ready for the exams.

114
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,467
Ms. Oono?

115
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,933
Yes?

116
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:29,267
Have you heard anything from Chiyomi?

117
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,233
Chiyomi called her family
to tell them she's still in Tokyo.

118
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:46,900
It's freezing.

119
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,067
-Can I have one more?
-Sure thing.

120
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,800
Ami, try this cookie!

121
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,500
What's wrong, Riku?

122
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,733
I thought I heard Chiyomi's voice.

123
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,067
Don't touch it!

124
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:29,700
Sorry.

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,367
What's wrong?

126
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,633
That was weird.

127
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,300
Yeah, what's gotten into him?

128
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:46,867
Psycho.

129
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:58,767
Are you okay?

130
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,300
I guess.

131
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,567
Gosh, that hurt.

132
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,067
Minami.

133
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,200
Minami!

134
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,700
There you are!

135
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,333
Damn it! Why should I?

136
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,233
I'm just asking you to come
for one competition.

137
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,467
I quit the club. I can't compete.

138
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:44,167
But Takatori broke his leg
and we're short one member.

139
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,267
Then drop out of the competition.

140
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,733
Don't be stupid. This is the match
that gets freshmen to join our club!

141
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,367
I still can't help you.

142
00:12:55,867 --> 00:13:00,600
Without new freshmen this year,
our club could be shut down!

143
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:02,300
Shut down?

144
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,267
You want the legacy of our kendo club
to end with us?

145
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:13,333
I hear a guy who won fifth place
in nationals is our competition.

146
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,367
Fifth place?

147
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,300
We can't beat him.

148
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:22,667
But I thought maybe
you can have a fair fight.

149
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,967
I'm begging you.

150
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,267
Ask someone else.

151
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,900
I would if I could.

152
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,633
I can't fail to get into med school.

153
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,733
I don't have time for this.

154
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,133
Come on! I'm your best friend!

155
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,033
I'll call you later. I need you!

156
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,367
Here.

157
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:03,333
Aren't you gonna dig in?

158
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:07,300
Yeah.

159
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,733
Hey...

160
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:11,467
What?

161
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:17,467
You always practice your swing
after your morning run, right?

162
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,233
I'm building my strength for the exams.

163
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,233
Shouldn't you fight for them?

164
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,300
Like I said...

165
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,100
Isn't Shaw your best friend?

166
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:38,333
No. That's what he calls himself.

167
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:43,800
You won't fail the exams
just from one day in the competition.

168
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,700
I know you want to.

169
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,300
You love kendo!

170
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,467
Just stop talking.

171
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,833
Are you scared?

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,833
Scared?

173
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:09,767
You just don't wanna lose
in the competition.

174
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,833
Shut up.

175
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,367
So what if you lose?
You're out of practice.

176
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,467
Losing from doing what you love
is not a failure!

177
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,067
I said shut up!

178
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:28,800
The Minami I love... is not a chicken!

179
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,233
That was figure of speech.

180
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,767
Who do you think you are?

181
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,133
Sorry.

182
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,433
What about you?

183
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,233
You can't do anything on your own.

184
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:03,400
Minami?

185
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,767
So, there you are.

186
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,400
Hey.

187
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,600
Sayori?

188
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,400
You always eat here alone, right?

189
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,533
It feels nice up here.

190
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,100
Maybe I should join you from now on.

191
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:27,767
Okay.

192
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,533
How do you expect me to eat?!

193
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:37,933
Maybe not.

194
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,433
Why not?

195
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,467
Is there someone else?

196
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,833
That's not what I mean.

197
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,133
Chiyomi.

198
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:56,933
Do you think Chiyomi really went to Tokyo?

199
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,633
Why would you say that?

200
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,500
Just saying.

201
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,100
Hey...

202
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:17,967
meet me after school?

203
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,000
Minami.

204
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:41,267
If you're gonna study
just go to the library.

205
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,767
Why come to a café?

206
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:44,633
It's like a date!

207
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:54,500
Aren't you gonna get that?

208
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:58,467
Nope.

209
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,900
Hey, can you explain this to me?

210
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:19,967
Where?

211
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,067
Oh, my gosh!

212
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:47,700
Sayori?

213
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,633
Are you hungry?

214
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,367
Not really.

215
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,967
You didn't have to fake a cough.

216
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,600
Let's order.

217
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:05,867
They have sandwiches.

218
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,733
Sure.

219
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:26,467
Is it true your father disappeared?

220
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:34,767
Why would you ask him that?
That topic is completely off-limits!

221
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,367
He didn't really disappear.

222
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,433
He left us for some woman.

223
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:44,867
He's not my father anymore.

224
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
You've never talked about that with me.

225
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,500
Same here.

226
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,600
My so-called mother left me.

227
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,333
She's not my mother.

228
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,300
What is this vibe?

229
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:06,167
It's like they understand
each other... perfectly.

230
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,400
See you later?

231
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,767
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

232
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,267
Minami?

233
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:07,467
Gosh... is it your first time?

234
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,133
Minami.

235
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,667
Can I save this for later?

236
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,200
La--? Later?

237
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,700
It's too loud!

238
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,400
Bye for now.

239
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,433
That pinhead! What about my feelings?

240
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,067
Is it true your father disappeared?

241
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,000
He didn't really disappear.

242
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,400
He left us for some woman.

243
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,400
He's not my father anymore.

244
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,133
Good!

245
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,433
Louder!

246
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:22,900
Great. That's my boy.

247
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:24,967
Keep going!

248
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:43,600
Here.

249
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,333
Hey, Minami?

250
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,233
What?

251
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:57,200
You started kendo
because of your dad, right?

252
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,133
That came out of nowhere.

253
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,267
You still practice your swing
every morning.

254
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:12,733
It's because you wanna stay
connected to your dad, right?

255
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,867
I hate you!

256
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,567
You still love your dad.

257
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,067
Stop it right now.

258
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,400
I've forgotten about him.

259
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,633
I don't even care.

260
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:41,900
That's a lie.

261
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,167
You changed after your dad left.

262
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,433
Of course I did!

263
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,267
My dad abandoned his entire family.

264
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:53,800
I had no choice but to protect my family!

265
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,567
You don't get it.

266
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:57,600
Minami.

267
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,167
You have no idea.

268
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:02,833
I don't.

269
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,467
I won't pretend I do, but...

270
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:11,033
But I wanted to help you so much!

271
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:13,700
Help?

272
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,733
I don't want help.

273
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:20,867
I'm gonna be a doctor.

274
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,367
That's how I'll protect my family.

275
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,700
I don't need anyone's help.

276
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,567
Minami.

277
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,733
That's why...

278
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,400
I have no time for sports or friends.

279
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,467
So, that's...?

280
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That's why you won't compete?

281
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:08,700
You're still up?

282
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,967
I couldn't sleep.

283
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:14,700
Were you studying this late?

284
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:18,433
No. I couldn't sleep either.

285
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,100
Can I ask you something?

286
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,833
What?

287
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,300
Mom...

288
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:46,200
Mom... don't you resent him?

289
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,700
Resent who?

290
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,767
The man who's supposed to be...
my father.

291
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,300
Noboru?

292
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:04,733
Don't you resent him?

293
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:08,933
Do I?

294
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,200
I might have at some point.

295
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,100
I'm serious.

296
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,967
All right.

297
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:24,567
Well... every day was such a struggle.

298
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,000
I didn't have time to be resentful.

299
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:32,633
No time?

300
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:37,133
Yeah. It was tough without him.

301
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:43,933
But if I didn't marry Noboru...
I wouldn't have met you, Shunichi.

302
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:48,067
I love living with your grandma.

303
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,867
I guess we break even.

304
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:54,533
Break even, huh?

305
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:56,667
Because, you see...

306
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:01,500
I have the most precious son.

307
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,767
I'm the happiest I could ever be.

308
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,267
My dearest son!

309
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,567
You don't have to try so hard.

310
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Man! You reek of alcohol!

311
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,167
Get older and drink with me!

312
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,367
Mom, you're drunk.

313
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,333
What is all this racket?

314
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,133
Sorry, Grandma. Mom is a bit drunk.

315
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:48,000
What? With that itty-bitty drink?

316
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,933
Fine. I'll join you.

317
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,733
Grandma?

318
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,933
Great!

319
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:57,267
You drunk.

320
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,767
Oh, my. Thank you.

321
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,833
I'll pour you a drink.

322
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
You're too kind.

323
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,433
There.

324
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,167
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

325
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:27,300
Minami!

326
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,500
That's the spirit!

327
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,500
Go, Minami!

328
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:35,733
With a sudden change of heart,

329
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,600
Minami suddenly decided
to fight in the competition!

330
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:42,900
GO MINAMI!

331
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,667
Go, Minami!

332
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:55,367
Go, Minami!

333
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,000
Go get them!

334
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,100
HIGH SCHOOL COMPETITION

335
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,667
Awa Higashi High School is
much stronger than last year!

336
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,267
I'm ashamed they beat us all.

337
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,500
That's their captain, Izumi.

338
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,633
No wonder he won fifth place in nationals.

339
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,933
Even Minami can't beat him.

340
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,233
Oh, well. Either way.

341
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:50,633
Lead, second, middle and vice-captain,
we all lost.

342
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,067
We've lost already.

343
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,967
You keep your mouth shut!

344
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,367
Even if Minami wins,
we'd still lose 4 to 1.

345
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,467
No freshman would wanna join us.

346
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:05,833
Our club ends this year.

347
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,467
Are you serious?

348
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:12,100
You need to stop whining
and show some support!

349
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:17,967
That was close!

350
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,500
Get them!

351
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,533
Minami, defense!

352
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:41,867
I wanna cheer for him
at the top of my lungs!

353
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,367
Go, Minami!

354
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,867
Go, Minami!

355
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,033
Go for it! Minami!

356
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,900
Minami! Go for it!

357
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,333
Go, Minami!

358
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,467
Go, Minami!

359
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:25,333
Don't give up, Minami!

360
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,267
Tsuki!

361
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:38,733
One point!

362
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,100
Yeah!

363
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:55,333
You did it, Minami.

364
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,033
Second match.

365
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,700
Minami almost had it.

366
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:36,400
He put up a good fight till the end.

367
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:52,967
He's a great swordsman, Izumi.

368
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:58,667
He's way out of my league.
I'm kind of glad I broke my leg.

369
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
Coach, I was only joking!

370
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,467
Huh? Where's Minami?

371
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,533
Damn.

372
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,100
Damn.

373
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:55,933
Minami.

374
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:17,700
THE BLUE FAIRY - EPISODE 11

375
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,133
No update.

376
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,233
LITTLE MISS CHOBI IN YOUR POCKET

377
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:22,767
If prenatal memory existed...
maybe it's something like this.

378
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:29,667
It's dark in here, but it feels warm.

379
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:33,933
I could always hear
the heartbeat of my love.

380
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:41,567
I'm surrounded by absolute tenderness.

381
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:45,300
I'm protected and cherished.

382
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:50,633
The first memory of happiness.

383
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:26,000
A new novel, Chiyomi?

384
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,033
Chiyomi?

385
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,767
Is that Chiyomi?

386
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,533
Yup. What do you think?

387
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:55,567
Oh, my gosh! Is that Chiyomi?

388
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:57,600
Did you make it?

389
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:01,033
Yeah. I stayed up all night for this.

390
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,033
Hey, let me see it.

391
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,633
Cool.

392
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:08,333
It looks like her.

393
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:10,567
A hidden talent, Riku?

394
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:12,233
It's not like that.

395
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,533
I've never made a doll before.

396
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,200
Really?

397
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:17,167
But why?

398
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:20,200
Yeah, why would you make this?

399
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:24,133
Why? It's because...

400
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,933
I wanted to put her in my pocket.

401
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,233
Put Chiyomi in your pocket?

402
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,567
That's pretty abnormal stuff.

403
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:33,867
Totally weird.

404
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,300
Riku, do you like Chiyomi?

405
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,367
You like her?

406
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,433
Yeah. I really like Chiyomi.

407
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
Seriously?

408
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:56,233
I already told her how I feel.

409
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,933
Damn.

410
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:01,833
That takes balls.

411
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,067
I couldn't say that in front of everyone.

412
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:07,333
He's still a weirdo.

413
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,367
Minami, why didn't you wake me up?

414
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:27,867
I'm home.

415
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,800
Hey!

416
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:38,000
Why did you go to school without me?

417
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,567
I tried, but you didn't get up.

418
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:46,100
Can I have the dance magazine
I asked for?

419
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:49,400
I texted you to get me one!

420
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:50,967
Text?

421
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:54,133
Yeah, to the address
we sent my video from.

422
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,700
Didn't you notice?

423
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,300
I ran out of battery.

424
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:00,533
No!

425
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,633
Okay then.

426
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:12,900
Let's go.

427
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,400
What? But you just got home.

428
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:20,633
That magazine or whatever...

429
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,000
you want it, right?

430
00:43:01,633 --> 00:43:02,667
NEXT EPISODE
EP.05 "CHIYOMI'S BIG ADVENTURE"

431
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,500
There have been many break-ins lately.

432
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,300
No way. Is that the thief?

433
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,400
What am I gonna do?

434
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,600
I gotta tell Minami.

435
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,233
That's it.

436
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,533
Who the hell are you?

437
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,100
You little shit!

438
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,633
Oh, no!

439
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,367
Minami!

440
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,267
DISCLAIMER:
