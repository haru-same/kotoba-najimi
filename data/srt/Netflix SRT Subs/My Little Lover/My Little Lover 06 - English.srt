1
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,167
I wanna go back to how it used to be...

2
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,767
back to when we were little once again...

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,433
Minami...

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,300
Chiyomi!

5
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:28,033
I'm over here, Minami!

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,867
Tokyo?

7
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,100
What is this?

8
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:39,233
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo.

9
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,600
Please. I wanna do this.

10
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,867
Let me stay with you, Minami!

11
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,533
Wait. How can that happen?

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,233
Is it true your father disappeared?

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,933
He left us for some woman.
He's not my father anymore.

14
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,000
I hate you!

15
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,233
No way. Is that the thief?

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,600
FROM CHIYOMI
The thief is here.

17
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:13,567
What's wrong?

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,100
Sorry. I gotta go.

19
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,500
-Wait. Minami?
-I'm sorry!

20
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:23,467
What do you think you're doing?

21
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,867
-Why did you come?
-This is ridiculous.

22
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,900
What happened to your divorce papers?

23
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,067
I sent them.

24
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,033
She said she signed them
the last time I called her.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,133
Watching someone you love sleeping...

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,667
is a happy moment for every girl in love.

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
Even in my tiny body...

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,767
feelings like that don't change.

29
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,133
Chiyomi?

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,633
No way.

31
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,767
Is it my turn...?

32
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,667
Don't worry, Minami.

33
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,767
I'll protect you.

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Wait!

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,233
Stop! Wait a minute!

36
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,567
It's kind of tight in here. You got big...

37
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,633
I can't move. I can't breathe.

38
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,167
Wait! Get me out of here!

39
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,400
I can't be in your pocket.

40
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,600
Sayori?

41
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,567
Hey, can I kiss you?

42
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:31,100
Now? I'm too tiny for that.

43
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,567
You're so adorable. I wanna eat you.

44
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,767
She's gonna swallow me!

45
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,033
Are you okay?

46
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,400
Yeah.

47
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,033
I guess.

48
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,200
Good morning.

49
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:25,467
Morning.

50
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,733
I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH

51
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,933
Ami. Did you call Chiyomi?

52
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,767
Well, let's see...

53
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,133
That's odd.
There's no one here by that name.

54
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,100
No... Are you sure?

55
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:37,900
Yes, there's no one here
by the name of Chiyomi or Horikiri.

56
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,533
Sorry, I forgot.

57
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,733
I'll text her later
and tell her you're worried.

58
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,667
I hope she texts me soon.

59
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,933
Can I get through?

60
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,600
Sure.

61
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:04,967
Ami...

62
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:06,700
Riku...

63
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,867
Did he see me?

64
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:18,600
I think he saw me for a second.

65
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,867
What's wrong?

66
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,567
Minami?

67
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,067
What?

68
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,233
Well... I...

69
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,167
It looks like her.

70
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Did you really make this?

71
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,100
Yeah.

72
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,333
Be nice to her.

73
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,033
Oops.

74
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,700
She drives me nuts.

75
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,400
Minami has a doll, too.

76
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,967
-That was better than mine.
-Riku?

77
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:33,800
Okay.

78
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:44,567
NOMURA HOSPITAL

79
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,533
DR. NOMURA - DIRECTOR

80
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,767
-Yes?
-Dad? It's me.

81
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,367
Perfect timing, Sayori.

82
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,933
-This is my daughter, Sayori.
-Hello.

83
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:09,833
Sayori, this is Dr. Reiko Koide
from Hokuryo University Hospital.

84
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,200
She's coming to work for us.

85
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,733
Nice to meet you, Sayori.

86
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,733
Likewise.

87
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,833
Now, if you'll excuse me, doctor.

88
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,333
Goodbye.

89
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:37,367
To what do I owe this rare visit?
Do you need something?

90
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,267
I don't need anything.

91
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,933
I'll buy you whatever you want.

92
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,900
It's about Minami.

93
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,133
Of course.

94
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:51,767
Dad?

95
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:58,000
Were you crazy about Minami's mother?

96
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,067
That's nonsense.

97
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:05,533
I'm just helping out an old friend
by hiring her.

98
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,733
Dad...

99
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,867
She turned down
my letter of recommendation.

100
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,233
She did?

101
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,900
There was nothing more I could do.

102
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,133
Sayori...

103
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,800
I have something to tell you, too.

104
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,367
What is it?

105
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,233
I'm thinking about getting married again.

106
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,233
What?

107
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,467
It's time I find happiness of my own.

108
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,167
-With whom?
-With Dr. Koide, whom you just met.

109
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:50,867
Wasn't she great?

110
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,767
Sayori, wait.

111
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,700
-Just do whatever you want.
-Sayori.

112
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,933
Do you actually think
you can have a happy marriage?

113
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:11,167
Have you ever thought
about why Mom left us?

114
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:17,233
This isn't the right place.
We'll talk about this later.

115
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,133
Why?

116
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,933
Why can't we talk here?

117
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:28,467
You value how you look
over your own daughter.

118
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:29,467
That's enough!

119
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,467
Sayori.

120
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,033
Sayori.

121
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,100
Excuse me.

122
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,900
What's this?

123
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,500
So, Shunichi did take these.

124
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,900
Hand-sewn?

125
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:01,833
Oh, no.

126
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,767
Hold on.

127
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,933
I'm gonna make you a pretty little dress.

128
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Is Shunichi a pervert?

129
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,133
No way.

130
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,333
Wait.

131
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,667
In this, too?

132
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm sorry, Shunichi.

133
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,567
He was sending an e-mail.

134
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,167
What? The address...

135
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,600
"oneinchprincess at beeble"?

136
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,433
I'm home!

137
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:05,700
Grandma?

138
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,600
-Hey, you're home.
-How do you feel?

139
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey, Shunichi.

140
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,467
Asuka!

141
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,567
Asuka?

142
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,200
What are you doing here?

143
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,400
She's such a sweetheart.

144
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,100
Asuka came to check in on me.

145
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,867
I'm glad you seem well.

146
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,667
And I thought you'd help me out
with my studies,

147
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,433
so, I was waiting for you upstairs.

148
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
What is my sister up to?

149
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,767
I'm sorry about the mess.

150
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,800
I don't mind it at all.

151
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,467
So, what was I gonna ask you...

152
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,367
Asuka?

153
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,567
You see, I'm a guy...

154
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,633
You shouldn't be here like this.

155
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:24,667
Does that mean...

156
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,700
you see me as a girl?

157
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:32,867
Huh?

158
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:38,033
Go on. You can have your way with me.

159
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,200
Asuka!

160
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,733
I got you!

161
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,700
Asuka! Let's just study.

162
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,433
My bad. Let me see.

163
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,767
I'm home!

164
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,533
Hey, Mom.

165
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,500
Come on in, Sayori.

166
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,700
This way.

167
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,100
Hello.

168
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:12,567
What?

169
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,333
A houseguest?

170
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,733
Sayori?

171
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,167
Hi, Minami.

172
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,600
Make yourself at home.

173
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,967
Now Sayori is here?

174
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,333
What's up with girls today?

175
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,700
This is nice.

176
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:43,267
It's delicious. You're a great cook.

177
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,367
Really?

178
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:49,000
-Do you like it?
-Yeah, it's great.

179
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,967
Sorry we made you cook for us.

180
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:54,800
Not at all.

181
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,800
I don't have a mother,
so, I always cook for myself.

182
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,867
I'm sorry to bother you
when you're not well.

183
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:08,367
Don't worry. I'm all better now.

184
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,700
She has an appetite, too.

185
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,700
This is a treat.

186
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,567
This is really nice.

187
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,567
I always eat alone.

188
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm sorry. What's gotten into me?

189
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:47,900
It's all right. You can let it all out.

190
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:49,633
Grandma.

191
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,233
Were you shocked
about your father's engagement?

192
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,000
You know...

193
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,767
I'm a daddy's girl.

194
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,700
So, when my so-called mother left,

195
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,300
I got over it pretty fast.

196
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,933
It was better
than seeing my mother cry all the time.

197
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,433
It's the opposite of our family.

198
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,267
Listen.

199
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,367
It's best to forget
about those who've left us behind.

200
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,300
But...

201
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:49,433
I'm starting to understand
what my mother must've felt like.

202
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,100
My father paid no attention to her.

203
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:03,167
My mother would cook for him,
but he never came home to eat it.

204
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Now I can see...

205
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,933
this is how my mom felt.

206
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,933
The ones who leave
have their reasons, too.

207
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,700
But my father...

208
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,767
he's about to make the same mistake.

209
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,633
He never loved my mother.

210
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:40,133
He just married his professor's daughter.

211
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,300
But really...

212
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,200
he loved someone else.

213
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,733
I think my mother was lonely.

214
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,633
I'm sorry to bring this up.

215
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,100
I know we all have problems.

216
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,133
It's okay.

217
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,033
It's all right.

218
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,467
You poor thing.

219
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,133
Minami?

220
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,267
I forgot my towel in my room.

221
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,767
Could you get it for me?

222
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,200
Sure.

223
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,567
It was a rough day.

224
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:23,833
Yup.

225
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,900
You and Sayori have a lot in common.

226
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,033
That's why you...

227
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,633
What?

228
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:43,433
Nothing.

229
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:48,300
Go on, tell me.

230
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,767
It's nothing.

231
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,567
Minami, are you still up?

232
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,467
Hey.

233
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,433
Hey.

234
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,167
Were you asleep?

235
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,067
No.

236
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,900
I couldn't sleep.

237
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,400
Can I come in?

238
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,200
What?

239
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,300
My dad told me.

240
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:50,000
Your mom turned down
my dad's recommendation.

241
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,833
-Yeah.
-Are you okay with that?

242
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:02,233
You're going so far away
for a school with a scholarship.

243
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:07,267
Do you know about all their restrictions?

244
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,733
I'll try other schools, too.

245
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,467
My dad can get you
into Takase Medical University.

246
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:16,867
You can get a scholarship
and you can stay here...

247
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,600
Thanks for everything.

248
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,067
But...

249
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,833
I'm not cut out for that.

250
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,000
Sorry.

251
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,233
But thanks.

252
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,800
You know how I feel, right?

253
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,333
What?

254
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,367
How much longer
are we gonna stay this way?

255
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:07,267
No! Get away from him! Please!

256
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,567
Don't you... like me?

257
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:18,833
Well...

258
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:20,900
No, Minami...

259
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,500
Is there someone else?

260
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,400
What?

261
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,200
Could it be... Chiyomi?

262
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,000
No way.

263
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:50,367
Then can we do this?

264
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,167
Don't! Minami!

265
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:07,733
You're so adorable. I wanna eat you.

266
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,033
She's gonna swallow me!

267
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm sorry.

268
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,000
I can't do this.

269
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,767
Do what?

270
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:39,233
I'm sorry, but...

271
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,167
I can't be doing this.

272
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:49,367
I have other things
that I should be doing right now.

273
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,133
So...

274
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,567
Okay, I'm done.

275
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,367
You're like a neurotic virgin.

276
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,100
Can't you see...

277
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,100
my heart can get hurt, too?

278
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,767
Sayori.

279
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,400
Good night.

280
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,200
Hey.

281
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,167
She's gone.

282
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,100
Chiyomi?

283
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,567
Why are you crying?

284
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:17,267
It's nothing.

285
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,300
-No, it's not.
-Just leave me alone!

286
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,900
The giant is sweet to me

287
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,300
only because I'm so small.

288
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:03,167
A suitable woman for him
should be his own kind.

289
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,733
Someone who can embrace him

290
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,100
and mend this heart.

291
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:15,800
All I can do is dance in his palms.

292
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,767
LITTLE MISS CHOBI IN YOUR POCKET

293
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,867
There are updates...

294
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,200
I could only be his burden.

295
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:35,767
I shouldn't dream
about receiving his embrace.

296
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:38,233
Chiyomi?

297
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:41,967
I knew from the start.

298
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:47,233
But I can't stop my tears.

299
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:56,900
Minami...

300
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Sayori?

301
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,400
It's your turn, Minami.

302
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,267
Wait.

303
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,167
Wait... stop!

304
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,600
Minami? Minami!

305
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,033
Oh?

306
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,800
So, this is where you've been hiding.

307
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:44,100
Let go of me, Sayori!

308
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,100
Can't you be quiet?

309
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:48,933
Ouch!

310
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,600
Minami!

311
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,867
Hey! Let me out!

312
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,633
Chiyomi?

313
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,100
You can't do this!

314
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:12,167
Get away from each other! No!

315
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,167
Just relax, okay?

316
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,267
We can't.

317
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,467
-But Chiyomi...
-Minami!

318
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:23,767
You can't do this!

319
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,400
Don't!

320
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:05,100
I'm going home.

321
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,633
Okay.

322
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:32,133
I'm giving this back to you.

323
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,933
How was it? Not bad, huh?

324
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,833
Never...

325
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:40,933
bring me this crap.

326
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,467
Got it.

327
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:51,167
This is not what you really need.

328
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I've got you covered.

329
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,233
Karaoke?

330
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:03,933
What are you up to? I'm not gonna sing.

331
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,200
A blind group date.

332
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:13,200
A what?

333
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,533
Listen, you gotta loosen up.

334
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,300
If you're girl crazy,
you gotta find release.

335
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:24,100
-I'm leaving.
-Wait, wait, wait.

336
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,367
Two college girls are coming. See?

337
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,233
They're both hot, right? We're lucky.

338
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,767
Will you look at her?

339
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,100
They're on their way.

340
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,533
-They're coming!
-Let go of me!

341
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,267
The party's here! I'm Nanami.

342
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm Hiroe. Enchanté.

343
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:55,400
Real high-school boys!
Are you boys virgins?

344
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:59,667
Don't know about that one,
but I bet Pretty Boy is taken.

345
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:04,333
It's actually the opposite.
I did it already.

346
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,700
But him... probably not.

347
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,800
Really?

348
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,767
Don't be afraid.

349
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:15,733
The cutest cherry boy ever!

350
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,767
If you'll excuse me.

351
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,200
Shaw, I'm sorry.

352
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,567
Chiyomi?

353
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,733
Chiyomi?

354
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,533
Hey.

355
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Minami...

356
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:13,467
your grandma found me today.

357
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:14,867
What?

358
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:18,400
She saw you?

359
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,800
I went out, and when I came back...

360
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:28,533
No! Let me out! Please!

361
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,167
Let me out!

362
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:38,167
Oh, my.

363
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,400
Please, let me explain.

364
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:47,200
So, this is where you've been hiding?

365
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,267
I've been looking for you.

366
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,800
Why aren't you surprised?

367
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:59,100
I thought you'd be in shock
seeing me like this.

368
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:03,033
You're cute as a button.

369
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,200
What? Was that all?

370
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,467
Then she gave me some treats,

371
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:13,533
we talked for a while, and she let me go.

372
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,267
But she didn't say anything.
She was just cooking dinner.

373
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,167
Do you smell that?

374
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,600
What? This chair costs 30,000 yen?

375
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:39,467
What a rip-off.

376
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:43,767
I've never heard of anything like this.

377
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,367
Grandma, the stove is on.

378
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:58,967
How silly. Who'd buy such a thing?

379
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:00,567
Only a fool would buy that.

380
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,233
-Grandma, the stove.
-What?

381
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,033
Hey, Noboru.

382
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,067
-Huh?
-I found something really rare today.

383
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,067
Guess what it was.

384
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:18,867
Grandma?

385
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:20,900
One-Inch Princess!

386
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:26,100
The One-Inch Princess came
to see me today.

387
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,633
One-Inch Princess?

388
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,900
One-Inch Princess?

389
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:38,467
I hope she comes to see me again.

390
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,533
oneinchprincess@beeble.co.jp
TO: AMI

391
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,400
I wish she'd write more often.

392
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,033
oneinchprincess@beeble.co.jp
TO: JOJI HORIKIRI

393
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:00,767
This e-mail address...

394
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,533
What?

395
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,433
"Oneinchprincess@beeble"?

396
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,000
"Oneinchprincess..."

397
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:27,000
Did my sister use that tablet
to send us the video?

398
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,667
If that's so...

399
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,733
Shunichi and Chiyomi are...

400
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,800
I hope your grandma is okay.

401
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,333
I don't know what happened.

402
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,667
I'm worried.

403
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,067
Isn't it too late for you to eat?

404
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,400
-It's not 10 yet.
-Crazy rules.

405
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,600
So sweet! Delicious!

406
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,300
I love these store-bought puddings.

407
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,567
Hey, you got caramel on your face.

408
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,400
-Where?
-There, left cheek.

409
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:32,933
Right here.

410
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,467
Feels like Minami's become sweeter
toward me.

411
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:44,733
Maybe...

412
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,367
Hey!

413
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,033
Maybe not.

414
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,400
NEXT EPISODE
EP. 07 "18-YEAR-OLD PROPOSAL"

415
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:04,933
My dad never proposed to my mom.

416
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:09,400
I don't think he ever loved me.

417
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:12,733
You made this for me?

418
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,267
Chiyomi has an impossible crush?

419
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,700
Then who is the giant?

420
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:19,767
I can't stand this.

421
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:24,533
Please. Tell me where Chiyomi is.

422
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,833
-My family is falling apart.
-Asuka...

423
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,233
