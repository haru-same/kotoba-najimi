1
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:10,200
I wanna go back to how it used to be,

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,933
back to when we were little
once again...

3
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,500
Minami.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,133
Chiyomi!

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,733
I'm over here, Minami!

6
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,500
Tokyo?!

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,900
What is this?

8
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:39,233
Didn't I tell you?
I'm auditioning in Tokyo!

9
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,167
Let me stay with you, Minami!

10
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:52,100
Chiyomi... A new novel!

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,833
I wanted to put her in my pocket.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,733
Do you like Chiyomi?

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,767
I really like Chiyomi.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Did he see me? 

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,733
Chiyomi is not at the audition.

16
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:20,100
What?

17
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:24,867
Are you really Chiyomi?

18
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm sorry about everything.

19
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,433
The worst sleeping posture as always.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,767
Minami?

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,033
Get up, we gotta leave for school.

22
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:04,500
You watched me sleep?

23
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:07,433
I was marveling at your posture.

24
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,100
I need to change.

25
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,533
Okay.

26
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,833
A lot has happened
in the four weeks since I turned...

27
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,233
Here.

28
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,633
Thanks!

29
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,000
Grandma made it.

30
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,600
Yay! We can eat delicious food again!

31
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:34,800
Hey, I did pretty good
while grandma was away.

32
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:39,533
Lately we have this great vibe
between us.

33
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,900
What a great change...

34
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:46,667
I think we have a good thing going.

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,367
You needed me to cook, remember?

36
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,733
I won't argue with that.

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,100
That's the spirit!

38
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,233
Shunichi!

39
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,767
A ROMANTIC GETAWAY FOR TWO

40
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,800
Hey Asuka, what's up?

41
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:51,000
What happened now?

42
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,800
Mom is gonna file
a missing person's report!

43
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,633
What?

44
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,567
You want to report Chiyomi missing?

45
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,500
Maybe you're overreacting?

46
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,100
I agree. That'll make things worse
for Chiyomi.

47
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,367
But it's been four weeks.
Isn't that reason enough?

48
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,800
Why can't we even reach her?!

49
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,567
How could I ever be calm?

50
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:21,533
That's pretty bad.

51
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,133
Mom...

52
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,433
Little Miss Chobi in Your Pocket

53
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,767
Chiyomi is on a roll.

54
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,233
What are you reading?

55
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:41,567
I'm reading Chiyomi's online novel...

56
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,967
Chiyomi?

57
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,467
Chiyomi, the girl who's missing?

58
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,800
Mr.Sasaki! Quiet!

59
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,333
What did you say? On-the-line novel?

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,033
Moon?

61
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,300
Who do you think it is?

62
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,967
The novel?

63
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:03,900
Minami!

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,467
We need to talk.

65
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,133
Why?

66
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,133
It's important.

67
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,000
Is this Chiyomi?

68
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,000
I haven't heard that name in a while.

69
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,733
"Little Miss Chobi in Your Pocket."

70
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,767
What is it?

71
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,467
I heard she's an online novelist.

72
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,500
Seriously?

73
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,033
She goes by Michaela Moon Rabbit.

74
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,733
Huh? Michaela Moon Rabbit?

75
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
Is that true?

76
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,933
But isn't she in Tokyo?

77
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,067
Oh, yeah, the dance thing.

78
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,267
This is bad.

79
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,233
Riku?

80
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,200
You fooled all of us.

81
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,900
I got tons of questions for you.

82
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:57,167
About your little Chobi too.

83
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,133
Come again? Chobi?

84
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,600
That doll in your pocket!

85
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,067
Are you gonna keep lying?

86
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,100
You put on a great show.
Maybe you should be an actor.

87
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:19,833
Riku?

88
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,533
Did you know about this?

89
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,367
What is it?

90
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,900
Chiyomi is the author.

91
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,067
Really?

92
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,833
Michaela Moon Rabbit?

93
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,300
I see Chiyomi is famous now.

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,867
Did you know about this
Michaela Moon Rabbit?

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,600
No.

96
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,167
Really?

97
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:53,833
Now he knows! Minami can't read it!

98
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,967
But wait. He'll never read it.

99
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,967
Yeah, he's not the type.

100
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,967
Little Miss Chobi in Your Pocket

101
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:09,100
This is definitely Chiyomi!
She would write this.

102
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,067
So does that mean...

103
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,867
Chiyomi is doing this online... whatever?

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,133
I guarantee it! But I'm glad.

105
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,933
I was worried
after her audition incident.

106
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,700
She's updating frequently too.

107
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,200
But why did she have to leave?

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,567
You're right. This is no secret.

109
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,267
I think she was embarrassed
to show this to her parents.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,733
But why wouldn't she tell us?

111
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:52,233
I actually knew that she
was Michaela Moon Rabbit.

113
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,900
Sorry, Ami.

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,833
It didn't feel right for me
to tell Chiyomi's secret.

115
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,967
That's no good!

116
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,133
You should've told us right away.

117
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,033
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:15,167
The day I confessed about knowing
her secret and my love for her,

119
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:18,867
she disappeared and I felt guilty.

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,667
It's not your fault, Riku.

121
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,700
The reason she disappeared
has nothing to do with her writing.

122
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,633
Or so I believe...

123
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:43,133
You should've told us.

124
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:46,833
I thought Chiyomi wanted
to tell you in person.

125
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,900
I had no idea how she felt...

126
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:58,700
What do you call this, self-expression?

127
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:03,600
I didn't know she had such a gift.

128
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,267
I remember when she told me
she saw a little person.

129
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,500
You saw what?

130
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,167
A One Inch Princess!

131
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,833
You know that's not true?

132
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,433
I saw her at the river with Minami--

133
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,033
Stop. Can't you see Mommy is busy?

134
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,233
Maybe Chiyomi did see it.

135
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,833
She's always been a dreamer,

136
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,133
the imaginary and reality
may seem the same to kids.

137
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,200
I should've been more understanding.

138
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:46,167
What if Chiyomi transformed
into a little person too?

139
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,300
Please, don't get dreamy on me now.

140
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:57,267
Maybe Chiyomi had a lot of emotions
she kept to herself.

141
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,033
Where is Shunichi?

142
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:13,300
Didn't he say
he was going for a quick run?

143
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,900
Leaving Chiyomi behind like this...

144
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,800
What?

145
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,700
The giant gave me this red dress.

146
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,533
Maybe he chose it randomly.

147
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:47,467
Nevertheless, he chose it just for me.

148
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:54,067
So, I wear my red dress
and dream of the giant.

149
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,633
In his pocket, I am closer to him
than anyone else.

150
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,433
I feel his warmth and heartbeat.

151
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:11,133
I could be closer to him
than any other woman of his kind.

152
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,667
So close yet so far.

153
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,633
Dreaming to be loved someday.

154
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,367
But I know the giant
will never love me back.

155
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,533
So I deny myself to dream.
I keep telling myself.

156
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,900
It's enough to be by his side,
I'm in love with the giant.

157
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,767
More than anyone could ever love...

158
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,700
What's on your mind, Minami?

159
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,033
You've been quiet all evening.

160
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,867
Yeah.

161
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,833
It's nothing.

162
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,733
Who is it?

163
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:46,867
I'm Riku, Shunichi's classmate.

164
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,733
Riku?

165
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,800
Why is he here?

166
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Oh, come on in.

167
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:57,600
Shunichi!

168
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:02,233
Riku is here to see you.
Come on downstairs.

169
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:08,700
Is his room upstairs?
I'll go and find him.

170
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,833
Oh, really?

171
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,767
You need to hide.

172
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,933
Yeah.

173
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,100
What's up?

174
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,567
What do you want?

175
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,333
I need to talk. Man to man.

176
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,367
Let me in.

177
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,900
Hey, wait!

178
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,600
I was studying.

179
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,467
Make this quick.

180
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,000
Your doll...

181
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,467
does she sleep here?

182
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,433
No this is...

183
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,800
It looks like a doll's bed!

184
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,967
Huh? What are you talking about?

185
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,833
This is for my towel!

186
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,767
Is that your best lie?

187
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,633
I'll show you!

188
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,033
Look! She fits perfectly!

189
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,633
What the heck are you talking about?

190
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:27,167
I'm not into dolls or whatever...

191
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,333
Stop lying.

192
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:31,900
I saw her.

193
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,833
I saw Chiyomi
in your pocket at school.

194
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,233
You did a great job.

195
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,933
So Riku thinks I'm a doll?

196
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:57,167
Whatever, that's not why I came.

197
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,433
Minami?

198
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,567
I know you like Chiyomi.

199
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,267
Riku...

200
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,933
I love craft so I get it.

201
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:19,500
Creating a doll needs passion.
You must really like Chiyomi!

202
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:26,233
What are you talking about?

203
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,033
She and I grew up together.

204
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,100
That's explains nothing!

205
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,433
Why are you in denial?

206
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,267
I'm not.

207
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,000
It's you! I know you're the giant!

208
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
Stop lying to me!

209
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
Because...

210
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,333
I love Chiyomi.

211
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,600
I was jealous
when I read her new novel.

212
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,833
I wish I was the giant!

213
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,300
I don't follow.

214
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,467
Then explain this to me!

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,633
Show me your doll! Where is she?

216
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,600
Stop! You need to stop!

217
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,600
Where is she?!

218
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm telling you to stop!

219
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:30,667
Sounds like teen spirit...

220
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:55,867
This...

221
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,433
I made this for Chiyomi.

222
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,767
It's so cute! Did you make this?

223
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,100
It's amazing!

224
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,967
Well...

225
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,067
I knew Chiyomi came here.

226
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
Let me see her.

227
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,400
You know where she is.
Let me see her!

228
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,867
That's...

229
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,367
impossible.

230
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,233
Impossible?

231
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Then let me ask...

232
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,533
what is Chiyomi to you?

233
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
What...

234
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,300
Mark my words...

235
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,533
you better not make her cry.

236
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,400
Can't you see from her novel?

237
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,167
She's heartbroken.

238
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,333
She believes she has
an impossible crush.

239
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,533
It's your fault!

240
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:25,667
My fault?

241
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,300
Does she...

242
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,633
Does Chiyomi know how you feel?

243
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,133
Why would you make her suffer?

244
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,800
If you love her, just tell her!

245
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,267
Let her know how you feel.

246
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,533
I'm scared...

247
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,367
to love someone.

248
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,000
In middle school...

249
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,667
my dad left us.

250
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,467
I hate you!

251
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,167
I think my dad...

252
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,633
he meant to love my mom
for the rest of his life.

253
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,067
But...

254
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,133
people change.

255
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,533
Me too...

256
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,133
So, you didn't want to hurt Chiyomi?

257
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,367
I decided never to fall in love again.

258
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,500
Because I don't wanna be like my dad.

259
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,933
But Riku...

260
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,800
When you...!

261
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:20,967
When you're around Chiyomi,
it really pisses me off...

262
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,133
You're jealous of me?

263
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,833
You?

264
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,600
I know I have no right, huh?

265
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,333
That night...

266
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,667
Chiyomi poured
her heart out to me.

267
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,267
But I...

268
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,633
I should've responded to her.

269
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:57,333
Then tell her how you feel.

270
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,333
She needs to know.

271
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:04,600
You're her giant!

272
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,067
The giant is in love with Chobi!

273
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:12,533
Chiyomi! You're the one for me!

274
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,133
Hey... don't tell me.

275
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:21,333
Your love is not one-sided!

276
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,000
Chiyomi!

277
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,133
You're already a part of me!

278
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Minami?

279
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,100
Minami!

280
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Chiyomi...

281
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,567
Did I just hear Chiyomi?

282
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,167
Minami.

283
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,333
Me too.

284
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:50,033
I really need you too.

285
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:56,767
D-- Doll?

286
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,633
Minami...

287
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,400
She speaks!

288
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,533
Thank you, Minami.

289
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:13,033
I finally know how you feel about me.

290
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,167
I felt the same way.

291
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,767
Until that night...

292
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,200
I was locking my love for you away.

293
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,167
Chiyomi?

294
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:35,167
Minami? Is this your doll?

295
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,700
Riku.

296
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,933
I'm sorry. After you told me
how you felt about me...

297
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,733
I transformed into this body...

298
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,300
Transformed?

299
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,600
Is it really you?

300
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah.

301
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,433
So you really are Chobi!

302
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,933
That's right.

303
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:12,767
Freaky, yeah?

304
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:16,967
No, no, no... Not at all.

305
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,533
You're so cute.

306
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
You're cute!

307
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,967
Minami got you that dress?

308
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:43,833
I didn't have any clothes
so Minami bought it for me.

309
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:45,933
Right.

310
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,833
She was wearing that till then.

311
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,867
Thank you.

312
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,167
If I didn't have that,

313
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,867
I probably couldn't face Minami
when he came looking for me.

314
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,367
Chiyomi!

315
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,833
Chiyomi!

316
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,700
I'm over here, Minami!

317
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,367
Minami!

318
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:24,267
Without it, I couldn't have survived.

319
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,100
Wow.

320
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,800
I guess I did something good.

321
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,633
That sweater...

322
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,467
it protected me when I had nothing.

323
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,367
You know...

324
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:45,233
I thought Chobi's small size
was a metaphorical expression.

325
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,800
Who would've thought that...

326
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:55,733
I knew I should respond to you,
but I wanted to grow back first.

327
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,233
I understand.

328
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,733
But, hey...

329
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,033
I already got your answer.

330
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:05,967
What?

331
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,633
Reading your novel made me realize
I'm not the giant.

332
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,233
If Minami felt the same way,
then I don't stand a chance.

333
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,600
Riku...

334
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,133
Hey.

335
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,267
Take care of Chiyomi, all right?

336
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah.

337
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,333
You know...

338
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,067
according to the original legend,
you need more than a mallet.

339
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,967
What?

340
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:04,100
You two already tried
the magical mallet, right?

341
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,533
Yeah.

342
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,433
That's only half the mission.

343
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:13,700
The old book said, after she
used the magical mallet,

344
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,833
the Princess went to Cape Akebono
and grew back.

345
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,033
Cape Akebono?

346
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:22,500
Give it a try.

347
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,500
Why do you want to travel alone?

348
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,567
It's only for one night, Mom.

349
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,833
It's a good diversion.
I made you lunch.

350
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,300
Thanks, grandma.

351
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:45,500
See you later.

352
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,867
Do you have everything?

353
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:49,800
I'm good.

354
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:54,567
I'm off!

355
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:01,733
Good morning.

356
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:03,400
Hey, Minami.

357
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:15,400
Hello?

358
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,300
Hello.

359
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,200
Welcome.

360
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Do you have a room for tonight?

361
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:25,633
A room for one person?

362
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:27,200
Yes.

363
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,867
Yes. Please come in.

364
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:34,800
Could you fill out the form, please?

365
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:44,267
Mom, he's probably still in high school.

366
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,767
Don't snoop on our guests.

367
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,967
Here's your tea.

368
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Thank you.

369
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,100
Enjoy your stay.

370
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,067
Here.

371
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,367
We're here.

372
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,300
A room for one?

373
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:29,367
You're a part of me, remember?

374
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm so happy! Thanks for this trip!

375
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,600
Wow, it's so beautiful!

376
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,000
Great sunset.

377
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
This feels great.

378
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,567
It's nice to relax in the tub.

379
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,500
Yeah, it's been hectic
taking turns to shower.

380
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:01,033
What if I grew back this moment?

381
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:02,400
What!

382
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Yeah... I've heard of spa therapy.

383
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,300
Oh, no!

384
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,033
We'll get busted! It's actually two of us.

385
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,633
That's wasn't my point!

386
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,900
If that happens, I'll wear your robe.

387
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,433
What will I wear?

388
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,300
You'll just wear your drawers!

389
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,733
No way!

390
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,733
You have your drawers!

391
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,600
This looks great.

392
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:52,300
Can I have an extra plate?

393
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,500
I cool my food because
of my heat sensitivity.

394
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:57,867
Certainly.

395
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,067
Let's eat.

396
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,133
This is delicious!

397
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,467
Yeah, this is great!

398
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,567
I think it's the best meal ever!

399
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:23,567
I never thought the two of us
could enjoy a meal like this.

400
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,600
Me neither.

401
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,367
Excuse me.

402
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:38,133
This one is amazing!

403
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,667
Try this one.

404
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:51,333
Be careful it's hot.

405
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:57,400
It's true, Mom! I heard a woman's voice!

406
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,300
Maybe it was the TV?

407
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:02,067
No! I bet he brought someone.

408
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:07,467
You know, it's strange
he needed that extra plate.

409
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,167
Heat sensitivity? He fooled me!

410
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,800
Stop that!

411
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,133
Welcome back!

412
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,733
Thank you so much.

413
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,767
What time is the sunrise tomorrow?

414
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,367
So, you're going to the cape?

415
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:35,500
In this time of the year, I would say,

416
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:38,200
you should leave here around 4?

417
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,700
Thank you.

418
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,367
I hear its good luck.

419
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:47,600
Especially for couples in love.

420
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,567
They often go together.

421
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:56,133
I'll make a wish
for me and my girlfriend.

422
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,267
Good night.

423
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,000
Enjoy your stay.

424
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,767
He was alone.

425
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:19,467
You need to be nice to every guest.
This is a place of relaxation.

426
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,600
So, he has a girlfriend.

427
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,200
That was short lived.

428
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,367
Didn't I tell you
not to fall in love with our guests?

429
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,967
You're one to talk.

430
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,500
I could hear your heart beating fast.

431
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,633
I know.

432
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,400
It's racing.

433
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,467
My heart is racing too.

434
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,633
Are you okay?

435
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:13,467
I guess...

436
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,467
Well... not really.

437
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,433
To be honest...

438
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,467
ever since you came...

439
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,700
I haven't been okay.

440
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,067
Really?

441
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,467
Minami?

442
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,467
We've endured so long already.

443
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,467
Our second time can wait.

444
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,700
Second time?

445
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,333
So, you remembered.

446
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,900
We're here!

447
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,533
This is it.

448
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,400
Keep looking at the sky.

449
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,033
Okay.

450
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:55,200
Minami? These are...

451
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,833
You'll need your clothes, right?

452
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,500
I...

453
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:11,967
I like you a lot.

454
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:14,967
I really do.

455
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,533
Minami?

456
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:25,867
We used to spend time together
every day.

457
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:30,067
We played in the river
and the mountains.

458
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:38,033
We looked for the Princess.
I was so happy together with you.

459
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Me too.

460
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,767
That was the best time of my life.

461
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,100
I always wished I could be
with you like that again.

462
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:52,933
We can.

463
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,567
I won't run anymore.

464
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:08,867
I love you.

465
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,333
Chiyomi.

466
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,267
Minami...

467
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,333
Chiyomi! Look!

468
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,400
Oh, God!

469
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,833
Please grow me back!

470
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,533
I beg you!

471
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,667
Please let me stay with Minami forever!

472
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,800
Please!

473
00:43:01,633 --> 00:43:03,167
FINAL EPISODE
EP.10 "GOOD-BYE CHIYOMI, GOOD-BYE MINAMI"

474
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:06,100
Why? Will I stay like this forever?

475
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:09,833
He must be dating Chiyomi.

476
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:13,033
We need to forget about each other.

477
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,767
Let's make it like this
all never happened.

478
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:19,567
Minami!

479
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,233
I love you, Chiyomi.

480
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:27,567
Together forever!

481
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,367
Pinky promise.
