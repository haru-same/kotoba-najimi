1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,633
Kotoko, look at that girl.

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:06,300
Who is that beautiful girl?

3
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:11,067
Obviously she is flirting with Irie.
Kotoko, you are in big trouble.

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,300
Kin-chan?

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:15,967
I'm working here during the day
and at your dad's restaurant at night.

6
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:19,267
I want to protect you from this devil.

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,333
Join the same club as Irie.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,100
Then you can stay with him

9
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,433
even though you belong
to different departments.

10
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,100
You live in the same house as him,
but you know nothing about him, huh?

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,067
Let's leave this house and go back
to a life with only you and me.

12
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:42,667
-Dad found a good house.
-Are you leaving our house?

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,133
If so, will you miss me?

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,600
Finally, I can go back to my old life.

15
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:01,800
No! I don't want to lose Kotoko!

16
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,733
-Calm down.
-But, honey...

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,333
Thank you for saying that,
but we've already made up our minds.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,667
Ai-chan,
we are happy to have you two here.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,167
We really want you to stay with us.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,133
You pay us your living expenses.
You're not a freeloader.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,467
We took advantage of your kindness
and stayed with you too long.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,467
If we move out,
Kotoko will be able to forget about Naoki.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,767
Is that the reason?
I will do something about him.

24
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,733
Mrs. Irie,
this is an issue between the two of them.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,700
You may think that I want any girls
to live with us, but that's not true.

26
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,133
I love Kotoko
because she is so positive...

27
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,667
so resilient...

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,333
and so adorable.

29
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:11,233
Thank you. What a lucky girl Kotoko is.

30
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,267
I'm really sorry.

31
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:32,167
Brother, did you hear that?
Kotoko is leaving. Yeah!

32
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:38,000
She has caused us so many problems.

33
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:41,900
It means that we don't need to be exposed
to "idiot virus" anymore.

34
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:46,100
I'm so happy! Dumb Kotoko will be gone!

35
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,033
<i>Ta-da! What do you think?</i>

36
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:36,567
<i>I really wanted a daughter and wanted to</i>
<i>decorate a room like this for a long time.</i>

37
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,267
<i>We've lived with the Irie family</i>
<i>for about a year.</i>

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Finally, my dad and I have decided...

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,533
to leave them.

40
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:17,600
Bye-bye.

41
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,633
See you again, Kotoko.

42
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:54,733
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Irie were so nice to me.</i>
<i>They treated me like a real daughter.</i>

43
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,367
-Honey.
<i>-And...</i>

44
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,400
<i>I have to say goodbye to Irie.</i>

45
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,467
Everything is over.

46
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,600
Kotoko, we are leaving.

47
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,567
This is it.

48
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,167
Come in.

49
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:13,567
Our new house was just vacated
by the renters and isn't ready for us

50
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,433
to move in yet.

51
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,900
For a while,
this is our temporary residence.

52
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:25,300
Why don't we stay at the Iries'
until the house is ready?

53
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:29,967
It's for you.
You need space to get over him.

54
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,100
If we stay with them,
you will be hurt more.

55
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,333
The sooner, the better.

56
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,800
A week or two. That's all.

57
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,467
<i>I don't live with Irie anymore.</i>

58
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:55,700
<i>My life without Irie starts today.</i>

59
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:59,333
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

60
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,900
You moved out of the Irie family's house?

61
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:09,533
{\an8}LOVE ACED

62
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,733
{\an8}Right now we live in a temporary place
until the new house is ready.

63
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,267
{\an8}-I thought you would never leave them.
-Me, too.

64
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,733
But her tie to Irie is gone
now that she's left their house.

65
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,467
Jinko, don't say that.

66
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
I don't care.

67
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,033
I've given up on Irie.

68
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,567
No way!

69
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,000
You never gave up on him
no matter how bad he treated you.

70
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,167
You always say too much.

71
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,633
I've changed.

72
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,733
I won't chase him anymore.
I'll stay away from his department campus.

73
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,167
What happened to you?

74
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,833
To tell you the truth,
my dad convinced me.

75
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,233
He's right.

76
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,000
<i>I have been watching you two.</i>

77
00:09:57,067 --> 00:10:01,367
Naoki, unfortunately,
will never develop feelings toward you.

78
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,767
You have no chance.

79
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,333
His words made me think it over.

80
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:15,867
-Kotoko...
-So, I forget about him from now on.

81
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:21,000
I will enjoy the college life
and find a cool boyfriend.

82
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,067
I'm proud of you.

83
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,567
-What is this?
-Only for Kotoko?

84
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,400
-It's not fair.
-It's a Kin-chan special.

85
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,800
Kotoko became a new person today.

86
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:44,067
So, today is her new birthday.

87
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
My birthday?

88
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,467
Good. Happy birthday to you! Got it?

89
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you, Kin-chan.

90
00:10:55,967 --> 00:11:00,267
Cheer up. I'll help you forget about Irie.

91
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:09,567
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KOTOKO

92
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,233
I'm home.

93
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,933
Now drop it in the egg.

94
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Then drop it in the bread crumbs.

95
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,567
What's going on? Where is Mom?

96
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,167
She's looking down.

97
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,500
<i>She has no appetite</i>
<i>and doesn't want to do anything.</i>

98
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,833
<i>She's depressed.</i>

99
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,967
So, we should do the housework
for a while.

100
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,400
-Housework.
-I've never seen her so depressed.

101
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,500
Yuki, let's make it.

102
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm home.

103
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,167
How was your day?

104
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,633
Today I'm making your favorite, lasagna.

105
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,200
Oh, no, dumb Kotoko is home.

106
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:36,100
Watch your mouth, Yuki.
How's college life going? Cheers!

107
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,933
Dinner is ready. Have a seat.

108
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,933
Hello. How was your day?

109
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Stop it!

110
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:17,167
I've promised myself
that I will forget about Irie.

111
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,300
I won't see the Irie family anymore.

112
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:29,967
Bro, what's wrong with Mom?

113
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,533
Don't tell me
that it's because dumb Kotoko left us.

114
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,967
Yuki, you have your own room now.

115
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:46,200
Why don't you stay there
instead of hanging around here?

116
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:50,700
I know,
but I'm used to being in this room.

117
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,033
Now I feel comfortable here.

118
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,000
Good night.

119
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,533
You gave up on Irie, right?

120
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,067
Then why are you still in the Tennis Club?

121
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,900
This is about my pride. I'm ready.

122
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,100
Serve! Go!

123
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,667
Ninety-five.

124
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,400
Ninety-six.

125
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,033
Ninety-seven.

126
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,467
Ninety-eight.

127
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,667
Ninety-nine.

128
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,267
One hundred.

129
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,133
You did it.

130
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,600
So many dropped out.

131
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:08,033
But you survived our hard training.

132
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm very proud of you!
So, I will give you a prize.

133
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:19,933
You can finally be on the court today.

134
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,800
No kidding? Really?

135
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,767
Yeah!

136
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,867
Fight. Fight.

137
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,633
Fight. Fight.

138
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,700
Fight. Fight.

139
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,167
Fight. Fight.

140
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,333
We can be on the court? As ball boys?

141
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:06,567
Who's aiming at me?

142
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,233
You haven't dropped out yet, huh?

143
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:17,767
I couldn't stand it if I were you.

144
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,267
Only basic training
and being a ball boy every day?

145
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:26,867
To make matters worse, Irie is not around.

146
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:30,200
-I'm not doing this to see Irie.
-Really?

147
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,500
Fight! Fight!

148
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,633
Why do I have to be a ball boy?

149
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,467
Hey, move your foot off the ball.
You shouldn't do that if you're--

150
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:58,400
You're still a ball boy, huh?

151
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:04,200
-Irie! Why are you here?
-Because I'm a member of the Tennis Club.

152
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,700
But you usually don't come
to the practice.

153
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,167
I come when I feel like it.

154
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,067
Irie, come over here.
Let's practice together.

155
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:19,000
The serve practice is over.
Next is volley shot and stroke practice.

156
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:24,533
No, no. I promised myself
that I'd forget about Irie.

157
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:34,000
<i>Why do you show up in my life?</i>
<i>I'm trying to forget about you.</i>

158
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:35,967
Irie!

159
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,667
Long time no see.
What brought you here?

160
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,133
Let me guess.

161
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:56,267
You want to challenge me. Am I right?

162
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:01,867
If you want.
But I don't want to embarrass you again.

163
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:07,067
You really want to do this?
It's your choice.

164
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:14,667
You are so confident, huh?
Why don't you allow me to set the terms?

165
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,633
Fine.

166
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,167
Then we play doubles.
My partner is Yuko Matsumoto.

167
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:26,500
-Your partner is Kotoko Aihara.
-What? Me?

168
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:32,067
-You must be kidding.
-Mr. Sudo swallows his pride.

169
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,200
He is desperate to kick Irie's butt, huh?

170
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:37,233
What's your problem?
Matsumoto is a girl in the freshman class.

171
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,733
Aihara is a girl in the freshman class.
It's very fair.

172
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,633
No way. It's totally unfair.

173
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:47,800
If someone won doubles with that one,
he could be a world champion.

174
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,133
Irie, you don't need to say that.

175
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,567
But it's true.

176
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,100
You said that you would accept any terms.

177
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,867
Matsumoto and Aihara, get on the court.

178
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,300
I'm sorry, but I won't be easy on you.

179
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,400
Please forgive me.

180
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:21,300
It's impossible, right?
I know it's impossible.

181
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:24,967
What is your answer, Irie?
Would you like to default?

182
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:31,767
Give up without trying?
What kind of man are you?

183
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,600
-Listen. You don't need to hit a ball.
-What?

184
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,900
Are you really doing it?

185
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,567
I have no choice. I can't back out now.

186
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,733
Anyway, you just stand there.

187
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,733
Never stand in my way.

188
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,667
<i>"Never stand in my way"?</i>

189
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,800
<i>I feel that Irie has told me</i>
<i>the same thing repeatedly</i>

190
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,167
<i>since high school.</i>

191
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,267
Serve. Play.

192
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:19,933
Hit it.

193
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,133
Fifteen-zero.

194
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,100
Game.

195
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,267
It hurts.

196
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,867
I'll never stand in his way.

197
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,633
Is that all you got?

198
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Take this!

199
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,633
Take this!

200
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,667
It's my ball. Get out of my way.

201
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,400
What?

202
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,500
Game set. Sudo-Matsumoto win.

203
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,933
The score is 6-2.

204
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,800
Good game. That was so close, Irie.

205
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,200
She is a perfect match for you.

206
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,133
Do you want to have a rematch?
Perhaps next week?

207
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:31,233
-Sure.
-What?

208
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,333
-Are you serious, Irie?
-You don't want to?

209
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:37,133
I may embarrass you again.

210
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:44,333
Fine. Rematch at the same time next week.

211
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Understand, Matsumoto and Aihara?

212
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,400
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,233
What should I do?

214
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:02,633
What? Play doubles as Irie's partner?

215
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:08,133
And you practice with him?

216
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,333
Kotoko, are you sure about that?
You are trying to get over him.

217
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,767
Meet him every day and forget about him?
How could you do that?

218
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,067
That's impossible.

219
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,833
To be honest with you,
I'm not sure if I can handle this.

220
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,433
That's what I thought. It's not easy
to forget about someone who kissed you.

221
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:33,667
Well, think of it this way.
This could be a great opportunity.

222
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:37,433
By accomplishing something with you,
Irie may become attracted to you.

223
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,333
No way.
I can't be any help to him in this match.

224
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:47,933
And I have done a lot of things with him.

225
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,733
He prepared me for exams
when we were in high school.

226
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,433
He even helped me do my summer homework.

227
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,900
-But Irie never became interested in me.
-You're right.

228
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:03,667
He was always cold-blooded.
He'll never change.

229
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,367
This may be a painful week for you.
Right, Kotoko?

230
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,967
I can't avoid Irie
for the rest of my life.

231
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:22,533
I will work hard at tennis
and at forgetting about Irie.

232
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,533
You're late.

233
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:50,533
I'm sorry. My class didn't end on time.

234
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,067
No excuses. Let's practice.

235
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,033
Hold it, Irie.
Aihara has not passed our tryout yet.

236
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,300
So, I can't let her practice on the court.
She is still a ball boy.

237
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,067
We have a match in a week.

238
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,433
I can't break our club rule.

239
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:16,867
Aihara, what are you doing? Pick up balls!

240
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,600
-Mr. Sudo is unreasonable.
-He won't back down.

241
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,033
He doesn't want to lose to Irie,
no matter what.

242
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm sorry, Irie.

243
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:33,267
Fight! Fight!

244
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:39,933
Six, seven, eight... and 9.

245
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:53,667
-What was that?
-Don't close your eyes.

246
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,033
Heads up even while picking up balls.

247
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,367
Keep your eyes open
and follow the ball with your eyes.

248
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,733
And move to where the ball is heading.
Understand?

249
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:11,400
Understood.

250
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,033
<i>I keep my eyes open</i>

251
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,000
<i>and follow the ball with my eyes.</i>

252
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,967
Keep my eyes open and follow the ball.

253
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,033
That's it!

254
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,367
Yeah!

255
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,367
Good job.

256
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,733
You are dismissed.

257
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,967
Your practice starts now.

258
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:53,633
What? I can't do that.

259
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,033
As I followed your instructions,
I got hit by balls a lot of times.

260
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,167
You can't practice with the club.
So, we have no choice.

261
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,633
Practice your swing 100 times.

262
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,600
It's started raining.

263
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,667
Starting tomorrow, we'll have
a morning practice, too. Get ready.

264
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,767
It's raining.

265
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,467
Faster.

266
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,300
Bring the shoulder in.

267
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,167
Get back in position quickly.

268
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,633
It's the rainy season, huh?

269
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:41,300
-It never stops raining.
-Shut up. Just do it.

270
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,367
-Yes, sir.
-Again.

271
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:45,567
I'm home.

272
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,600
Listen, Kotoko.

273
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:55,633
I got a fresh rockfish today
and cooked it exactly the way you like.

274
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,767
You want to try it now?

275
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:01,100
What?

276
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:31,100
You've gained weight,
so, you should go on a diet.

277
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,567
-Hey.
-The low-fat diet is popular.

278
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,167
-Low-fat diet, huh?
-Hey. Hey.

279
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:39,433
Kin-chan?

280
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:41,667
Where is Kotoko today?

281
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:47,567
-Kin-chan, you don't know, huh?
-Kotoko is in trouble.

282
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,633
What? She is in trouble?

283
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,900
Ta-da. Ta-da.

284
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,567
-Good morning.
-Kin-chan.

285
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:18,767
I heard.

286
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,200
You have two practices every day
and are exhausted.

287
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,800
In such a situation...

288
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:29,467
you must eat well.
Otherwise, you can't continue.

289
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,267
Thank you.

290
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,200
Here you go.

291
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:40,967
Thank you.

292
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,567
Bon appétit.

293
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,267
-It's so delicious.
-Is that so?

294
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,167
Hey.

295
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:25,133
Are you trying so hard at tennis...

296
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,233
because you want to be with Irie?

297
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:38,200
You can't forget about him, can you?

298
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:53,133
He told me, "Never stand in my way."

299
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,933
Remember you told me the other day
that it was my new birthday?

300
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,700
To become a new woman...

301
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,467
I must become somebody
who won't bother him.

302
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,400
If I just say, "I will forget about him,"
without any actions...

303
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,767
it sounds hollow.

304
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:32,767
It means that I may not be able
to get over him yet.

305
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,167
I got it.

306
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,533
Kotoko, you are on the journey
to get over Irie.

307
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,033
It may take time...

308
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,467
but I will support you.

309
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,867
-Kin-chan.
-On the other hand...

310
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,667
I'm not giving up on you.

311
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,067
I'm very tenacious.

312
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,867
Don't be surprised.

313
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,967
-Thank you, Kin-chan.
-You're welcome.

314
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,900
-Eat it.
-Okay.

315
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,933
Let's do it.

316
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,667
Again. Here you go.

317
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:31,100
Swing with your shoulder. Here you go.

318
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,400
Keep your eyes on the ball.
That's good. Again.

319
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,000
The light's out, huh?

320
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:46,200
We have no choice.

321
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,433
Let's practice a swing now.

322
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,967
Think of it as a ball and push it.
Good. Remember that.

323
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
The shoulder should be higher.

324
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,033
-One.
-One.

325
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:12,200
-Two.
-Two.

326
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:18,000
-Come on. Visualize the ball.
-Sorry.

327
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,067
Toss the ball up as high as you can.

328
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,833
Bring the racket back faster.

329
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,167
-Okay.
-Again.

330
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,567
-Run.
-Got it.

331
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,867
-Run.
-Okay.

332
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,033
-Again.
-I'm ready.

333
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,300
Faster.

334
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,533
-Back in position with side step.
-Yes, sir.

335
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:42,300
Again.

336
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,367
Back to the position.

337
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:50,833
Keep your eyes on the ball.

338
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,533
-Faster.
-Trying.

339
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,267
Back in position with side step.

340
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,367
Get back on your feet.

341
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Let's do it again.

342
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:13,767
Faster.

343
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,600
Excuse me?

344
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:45,900
Wait.

345
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,067
Excuse me.

346
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,867
-Where is the Department of Literature?
-That way.

347
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,933
-Thank you.
-Mrs. Irie?

348
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:01,067
Hi, Mrs. Irie.

349
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,133
Hi, Jinko and Satomi. Long time no see.

350
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Why are you hiding your face?

351
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,667
My son will be mad if he finds me here.

352
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:13,900
That's why I am in disguise.

353
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,633
Actually, you stand out.
And it's easy to tell that it's you.

354
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,933
You behave like Kotoko.

355
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:28,067
Kotoko?

356
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,433
I haven't seen her for a while.

357
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,200
I miss her so much.

358
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,367
We also thought that Kotoko and Irie
would be a good couple.

359
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,600
-They even kissed once.
-No.

360
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,167
Shut your mouth.

361
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,067
Kiss? You mean...?

362
00:35:56,633 --> 00:36:00,067
Yes. The kiss.

363
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,600
Ki...

364
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,600
Did they kiss?

365
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,433
-Don't you need to see Kotoko?
-She's on the court.

366
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,133
That's okay.
I don't need to see her at the college.

367
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:35,833
I will bring Kotoko back to my house.

368
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:42,567
What? Kotoko is trying to get over Irie.

369
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:48,233
She doesn't need to get over him.
They kissed, right?

370
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,533
No matter how much my son opposes it,

371
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,267
I will bring Kotoko back.

372
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,700
One, two.

373
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:09,800
-Again.
-Sure.

374
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:17,433
Bring the shoulder higher.
With count one, toss the ball. One.

375
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,333
You crossed the line. Again.

376
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,267
One, two.
Take aim before hitting the ball. Again.

377
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,500
One, two. Keep your eyes on the ball.

378
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,033
One, two.

379
00:37:55,533 --> 00:38:02,200
I did it! I did it!
I made it for the first time!

380
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,633
I'm sorry.

381
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:14,767
Even a kid could learn how to serve
within a day.

382
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,433
I guess so.

383
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,233
You have a lot of things to celebrate.

384
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,967
Sometimes I envy you.

385
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,633
-Do it again.
-Sure.

386
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,600
THE DAY OF REMATCH

387
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:44,400
-See you later.
-Have a great day.

388
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,000
-Wait, Kotoko.
-Yes?

389
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,867
We're moving into the new house today.

390
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:02,733
Right. I totally forgot about that.

391
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,700
Don't come back to this apartment tonight.
Go to the new house.

392
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,600
Don't worry. I know where it is.

393
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:11,433
-See you later.
-Have a great day.

394
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,533
I hope she won't forget.

395
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:25,200
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

396
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:31,133
-Kin-chan.
-Hi, Kotoko.

397
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,933
-Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

398
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:44,567
Kotoko, you've worked so hard.
I'm proud of you.

399
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:49,167
-You have a rematch this afternoon, right?
-Yes.

400
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,000
I brought some food for good luck.

401
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,033
Pork-cutlet sandwich.

402
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,500
Wow! Pork-cutlet sandwich!

403
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,833
Thank you, Kin-chan.

404
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:27,033
Enjoying that pork-cutlet sandwich?
You don't look nervous at all.

405
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,500
It's good-luck food.

406
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,033
If that kind of superstition worked,
nobody would lose a match.

407
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:43,333
Are you aware
how much trouble you cause Irie?

408
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,833
I'm working hard not to be a drag on him.

409
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,300
Your working hard is causing him trouble.

410
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,967
He was embarrassed
by the loss of the last match.

411
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,700
He will be embarrassed again today.

412
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,000
He also had to waste his time
to train you.

413
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,400
I don't understand how you can be okay
with the fact

414
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,767
that you're causing trouble
for someone you love.

415
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:35,033
-Which?
-Rough.

416
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:43,533
Smooth. Service!

417
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,633
Listen. Believe in what you've done
for a week.

418
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Keep your eyes open and follow the ball.

419
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,567
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

420
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:05,500
You are not alone. I'm with you.
So, don't be scared.

421
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,233
Understood.

422
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,000
Sudo-Matsumoto, serving play.

423
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:14,100
I can't believe
that that novice touched my serve!

424
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:19,467
But her ball didn't come to our side.
We're winning with a large margin.

425
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:24,933
It's a matter of my pride.
I don't care about Irie anymore.

426
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,767
-Let's try to humiliate Aihara.
-Sure.

427
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:38,067
Keep your eyes open and follow the ball.
Move where it is heading.

428
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,567
<i>Wow. I'm not afraid of the ball anymore.</i>

429
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,733
<i>On top of it, both Sudo's shot</i>
<i>and Matsumoto's shot</i>

430
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:52,533
<i>are much slower than Irie's. That's why...</i>

431
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,167
Take this, Aihara.

432
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:16,933
-Kotoko!
-Yes, sir.

433
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,733
<i>I see it.</i>

434
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:42,233
Wow, she returned Mr. Sudo's serve.

435
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,900
No girl in our club could do that
except Matsumoto.

436
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,333
I'm impressed, Aihara.

437
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:52,700
You did it.

438
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,367
When did I grab a racket
for the first time?

439
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:10,467
It was when I was born...

440
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,467
Did you twist your ankle?

441
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:20,567
What a pity.

442
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:24,267
-Right here?
-It hurts!

443
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,067
It's impossible to continue.

444
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:29,567
Mr. Sudo, we withdraw from the match.

445
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:33,767
Wha...? What? Are you sure about that?

446
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:36,033
Take my racket.

447
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:54,567
I'm sorry. We lost again. It's my fault.

448
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,900
Actually, I didn't believe we could win.

449
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:14,800
<i>Lord, will you get mad...</i>

450
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,800
<i>if I'm even more in love with Irie?</i>

451
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:30,867
Where is your house?

452
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:36,300
It's strange.
It wasn't that far from the station

453
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,800
when I came to check it out the other day.

454
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,633
I don't think that it's far from here.

455
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,733
You said that before.

456
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,533
That's why I suggested taking a cab.

457
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,333
-It's waste of money.
-Put yourself in my shoes.

458
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:54,967
Okay.

459
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:09,033
When I returned Mr. Sudo's serve
in that match...

460
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:12,900
you called me by my first name.

461
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,467
I don't remember.

462
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,500
That's the first time
you've called me by first name.

463
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:22,567
As I said, I don't remember.
I was so absorbed in the match.

464
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:33,633
Look. That's the one.
That's our new house.

465
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,633
This is my house.

466
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:44,000
-Say hi to your father for me.
-Wait.

467
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,667
I think he's home.
Would you like a cup of tea?

468
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:56,467
Dad wants to see you.
I'm sure that he wants to thank you.

469
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:59,133
Fine. Okay. So, let go of my arm.

470
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:02,600
Sorry.

471
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,667
-Yes?
-Dad?

472
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,633
Is he your grandpa?

473
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,067
I don't know him.

474
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,267
-Who are you?
-That's so rude.

475
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:36,533
-Who the hell are you?
-I live here.

476
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:42,133
-This is my house.
-No way. I think this is mine.

477
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,867
-But I came here once.
-Whatever.

478
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:48,400
This is my house.

479
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,533
I'm confused.

480
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,533
What are you talking about?

481
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,400
-I know you two kissed.
-Kiss?

482
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:37,567
Go out with my son.

483
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,133
That is your mission.

484
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,167
Are you going to follow Irie's date?

485
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:45,767
Let's make a pact to help each other.

486
00:50:46,633 --> 00:50:49,267
-So cool.
-He took Kotoko to see this movie?

487
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,833
You are so dirty.

488
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,000
We make a good couple, don't we?

489
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:56,900
{\an8}-Maybe.
-It doesn't mean that you dislike me?

490
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,000
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

491
00:50:58,067 --> 00:51:00,500
{\an8}You are hard to deal with,
but I don't dislike you.
