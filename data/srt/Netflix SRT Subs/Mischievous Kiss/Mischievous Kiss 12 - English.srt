1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,833
I'm going to the party, too.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,833
I heard that you couldn't come.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,467
Your girlfriends will be with you
for Christmas, right?

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:12,900
Let's make it a fun night together.

5
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,433
Listen, I want
to introduce someone to you.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,100
Boyfriends? When did you both...?

7
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,633
I was betrayed after all.

8
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,200
If I knew this would happen,

9
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:27,867
I would've gone to Mr. Irie's party.

10
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,700
Around this area,

11
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,433
I heard burglars were prowling.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,667
Burglar!

13
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:46,367
You bastard, bastard, bastard!

14
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,200
What are you doing?

15
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:50,767
Weren't you going to have a party
with your friends?

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,333
There is one.

17
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,567
The cake.

18
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,800
<i>Even though it was a coincidence,</i>

19
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:01,333
<i>my first Christmas-like Christmas</i>

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,733
<i>was spent with just Irie and me.</i>

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,100
<i>It's like a dream come true.</i>

22
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,900
Wait for me, Kotoko.

23
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,033
I'll bring you dinner.

24
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,033
It's really like Christmas.

25
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,367
What's going on? It's dark in there.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,800
<i>The Christmas Eve</i>
<i>that I spent with Irie was</i>

27
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,367
<i>so much fun for me, but...</i>

28
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:33,600
<i>it was just a special treat.</i>

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,267
<i>My relationship with him</i>
<i>hasn't changed at all.</i>

30
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,167
<i>The seasons have passed</i>
<i>and the year has changed.</i>

31
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:47,167
<i>Another spring has come.</i>

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,367
<i>We've become sophomores in college.</i>

33
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,767
<i>Tonan University is</i>

34
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,167
<i>welcoming new freshmen.</i>

35
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,167
I'm the tennis club's 54th captain,

36
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,000
Sudo.

37
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:27,467
Now,

38
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,733
from a freshmen representative
with a bright future,

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
I'd like to receive

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,533
an address.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,333
Go ahead.

42
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:44,033
I started law school
at Tonan University this year.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,833
I'm Ayako Matsumoto.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,967
I was the winner of last year's

45
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,933
national high school competition
in the girls' division.

46
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:54,400
My goal in college is to win
a national championship.

47
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,667
And also...

48
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,233
to steal Naoki's heart.

49
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,900
Please guide me.

50
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,733
What do you teach your sister?

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,300
That's what I want to know.

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,267
<i>Well, this newcomer is with us, too.</i>

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,133
We're sophomores now.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,233
It feels awkward to be called <i>senpai.</i>

55
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,267
Right. I still can't get out
of the mindset of a freshman.

56
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,700
What are you reading so earnestly,
Satomi?

57
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:42,267
Ah, well, I'll start...

58
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:46,200
working as an editorial staff member
for this magazine tomorrow.

59
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,533
What?!

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,100
We have to start thinking
about finding employment, right?

61
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,733
I've been wanting to work

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,267
in an editorial department
for a women's magazine.

63
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,433
I've been visiting them often
to sell myself,

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,200
and I finally got accepted.

65
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,300
Great! That's awesome, Satomi.

66
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,400
They told me that I would run errands
and serve tea first.

67
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,733
But I feel like I've finally toed
the line.

68
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:11,833
I'll work hard.

69
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,833
What are you going to do
in the future, Kotoko? Maybe...

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,267
marrying into Irie family
as soon as you graduate?!

71
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,367
No way!

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,733
I've never thought
about my job specifically.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,500
It's about time to get started
and get things going for you.

74
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,567
Right. You're being too passive.
We'll be job-hunting next year.

75
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,800
You have to research it
and get things going.

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,867
I'm aiming for record labels
and music production companies.

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,933
Are you influenced by Narasaki?

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,733
In the beginning,
I just wanted to support him,

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,600
but I got interested
in indie music more and more.

80
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,467
The band that'll be known worldwide...

81
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,733
I want a job discovering that band.

82
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:58,667
I see.

83
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,833
My dream for the future will be...

84
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,433
It's not that.

85
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,767
Your mind is easy to read.

86
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,433
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

87
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,667
<i>everyone started chasing their dreams.</i>

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,200
<i>I...</i>

89
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,767
<i>What's my future dream?</i>

90
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:55,333
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

91
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,433
{\an8}BEYOND EACH DREAM...

92
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,633
{\an8}We're gonna throw a promotion party
for you and Naoki.

93
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,233
Is Irie coming home that day?

94
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,933
Of course.

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There's no party
without the main guest.

96
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,833
It's been a while

97
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,767
since Irie came home.

98
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,500
Right? I can't wait.

99
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,900
Kotoko, you've got to take action.

100
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,767
It's a new semester.

101
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:29,600
At college,
you've got a newly arrived rival.

102
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
You can't let your guard down.

103
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,733
Mrs. Irie, when did you...?

104
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,433
She's kind of cute,

105
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,400
and her tennis skill might be better
than her sister, but...

106
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,633
My goal in college is to win
a national championship.

107
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
And also...

108
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:53,400
to steal Naoki's heart.

109
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,900
She's totally unacceptable.

110
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,100
She's the type
that doesn't take challenges well.

111
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:09,067
If anything happens,
she'll take up with another man.

112
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,000
No matter what happens,
you're devoted to Naoki.

113
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:17,033
She doesn't possess
that same stubborn will power.

114
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:20,267
Should I take that as a compliment?

115
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,167
Work hard, Kotoko.
You're a sophomore.

116
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,867
You'll be 20 this year.

117
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,600
You're not a child anymore.

118
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,800
To become a family in the future,

119
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,167
we'll make a big step this year. Okay?

120
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,633
-Yes.
-Okay!

121
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,567
Mr. Irie, thank you for waiting.

122
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,067
I'll explain the result
of the examination.

123
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,933
Please do.

124
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,367
AIHARA

125
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:33,967
Enjoy.

126
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:43,000
It's rare for you
to come here by yourself.

127
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,100
Sometimes...

128
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,033
I feel like drinking by myself.

129
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,467
-There.
-Thank you.

130
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,967
That's good.

131
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,700
Your food and sake are
the best combination.

132
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,200
It's such a nice restaurant.

133
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:12,767
Thanks.

134
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,467
Hey, Ai-chan.

135
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,800
Ai-chan,

136
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,067
what are you going to do
with this restaurant in the future?

137
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,467
Is your apprentice taking it over?

138
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:32,067
Or are you going
to have Kotoko marry someone?

139
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,133
Kinnosuke.

140
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,833
You always say you'll marry Kotoko
and take over this restaurant.

141
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,033
Aren't you going
to interrupt them like that?

142
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,267
Eventually, I want Odawara
and Kinnosuke to be independent.

143
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,000
I want them
to have their own restaurants.

144
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,533
For cooks,

145
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,333
it's their dream to have
their own restaurant.

146
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,267
But what's going to happen
to Aihara then?

147
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,900
Even if I want a successor,

148
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,667
Kotoko is a bad cook,
as you know.

149
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:15,567
This restaurant ends with me.
There's nothing I can do about it.

150
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,333
Even though you've made this
into such a great place?

151
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:25,233
It's my fate to have a daughter
who's not so smart.

152
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
I just have to accept it.

153
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,700
However,

154
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,533
finding a husband for her
can still be an option.

155
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,100
In fact, that Kinnosuke has been

156
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:40,000
in love with Kotoko
since high school, right?

157
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,267
Just between you and me,

158
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,233
Kinnosuke is talented for sure.

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
He can become the chef
and successor of this place.

160
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,267
He has the potential.

161
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,700
Then why don't you?

162
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,133
It all depends on how Kotoko feels.

163
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,900
I think you're the same,

164
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:07,667
but I've been doing whatever
I wanted to do. That's why...

165
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,967
I can't tell my daughter
that in order to keep the restaurant,

166
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,300
she'd have to marry the cook
of my choosing.

167
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,733
Even though my daughter would do that,

168
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
if there's someone
who wants to marry her,

169
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,233
it's best to marry the man

170
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,833
who really loves Kotoko.

171
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,067
That's what I think.

172
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,233
-Really?
-Yeah.

173
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,533
Hey, watch out here.

174
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,033
Uh, sorry.

175
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,267
Kinnosuke?

176
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,667
What's wrong?

177
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,233
Are you sick?

178
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,933
I'll take the trash out.

179
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,900
What's up with you?

180
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,333
It's unlike you, Kinnosuke.

181
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,533
What's up?!

182
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,033
What's this pent-up feeling?

183
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,633
-Chef.
-Yes.

184
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,567
Here they are.

185
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:17,833
Is it my ego wanting my son

186
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,567
to take over the business?

187
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,967
-About Naoki?
-Yeah.

188
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,433
He's not interested in it.

189
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,500
Well...

190
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,967
even if Naoki doesn't want it,
you still have Yuki.

191
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,067
You have two great sons.

192
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,367
You're a lot different from me,
who only has Kotoko.

193
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,900
Things will work out.

194
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,467
If it's Yuki,

195
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,433
it'll be too late.

196
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,400
What?

197
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,433
Satomi is late.
The class is starting soon.

198
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
It's already time.

199
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,567
You're here. Good morning.

200
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,100
Just in time. You're late today.

201
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,533
I worked late last night.
I didn't sleep.

202
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Did you pull an all-nighter?
Are you okay?

203
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,867
I'm totally fine.

204
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,600
The editorial department gets crazy
before printing.

205
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,100
Everybody is in full swing.

206
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,267
The more they work,

207
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,133
the better the articles get.

208
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,700
Even an amateur like me can't tell.

209
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,767
You know,
magazines are like living creatures.

210
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,500
Just being there makes me excited.

211
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,667
It's a very fulfilling job.

212
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,067
I can relate. It's so exciting.

213
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,033
-I love you, Jinko.
-That's what society is.

214
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Right. I don't get tired
even if I don't sleep.

215
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,633
Not at all. I was fine, too.

216
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,967
-Can you feel my excitement?
-Yes. I'm feeling it.

217
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,300
-I'm tired.
-Me too.

218
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,133
-I'm hungry.
-What do you want to do for lunch?

219
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,667
Shall we go to the cafeteria?

220
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,167
Sorry, I have to work this afternoon,
so I'm leaving.

221
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm having lunch with an alum
who works at a music label.

222
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,100
-Sorry.
-Okay.

223
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,933
See you later, then.

224
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,467
-See you tomorrow.
-See you later.

225
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,233
Bye, see you later.

226
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Bye-bye.

227
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,933
Bye-bye.

228
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,533
Kin-chan.

229
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,200
Could you try this one?

230
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,100
Sure, but what is it?

231
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,967
Soon...

232
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:55,200
my cuisine might be offered at Aihara.

233
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,400
-So....
-Your cuisine will be served there?

234
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,833
Great.

235
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,700
It's only one dish.

236
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,500
Besides it's served
before the appetizer,

237
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,567
like an hours d'oeuvre.

238
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,367
First, Chef has to taste-test it

239
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,800
and approve it.

240
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,767
For someone like me

241
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,467
to make the full course

242
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,200
will take many years.

243
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,000
But it's great.

244
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,100
I'll take your praise after you try it.

245
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,533
Okay, I'll taste it now.

246
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,233
Let's see.

247
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,600
What?

248
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,467
Was it bad?

249
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,167
Did I fail on flavoring?

250
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,733
It's very delicious.

251
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,433
You've been good at cooking
since high school,

252
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,567
but it's totally different now.

253
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,133
It tastes like a pro.

254
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,300
Really?

255
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,267
But you don't look very happy.

256
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,200
I thought...

257
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,800
everyone was amazing.

258
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,733
I've been wanting to work

259
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,600
at an editorial department
for a women's magazine.

260
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,867
You know,
magazines are like living creatures.

261
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,700
I get excited just being there.

262
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:38,033
It's a very fulfilling job.

263
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:43,767
I'm aiming for record labels
and music production companies.

264
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,600
I got interested
in indie music more and more.

265
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,433
The band that'll be known worldwide...

266
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,867
I want a job discovering that band.

267
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,833
You, Jinko and Satomi have found
what you want to do.

268
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,867
You've started chasing your dreams,
but...

269
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:03,533
I haven't found anything yet.

270
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:11,633
Everyone has... their own pace.

271
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,300
You can find your own pace.

272
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,633
Hey, how did you feel
when you decided to be a cook?

273
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,200
How did you know that it was
what you wanted to do?

274
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,600
Well...

275
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,233
I wonder what it was like.

276
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
No.

277
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,633
It's not something
that you think about.

278
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,100
It's the same as falling in love.

279
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,967
Same as falling in love?

280
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:44,933
Right.

281
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,300
When you fall in love,

282
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,633
you know it without thinking, right?

283
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,133
"I love this person like that."

284
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,933
It's the same thing.

285
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,233
Without thinking complicating things,
you get excited and feel happy.

286
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:06,233
You want to be
with that person forever, right?

287
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:09,233
It's the same as that.
Before I knew it,

288
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,500
I was doing what I wanted to do.

289
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,600
I see.

290
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,100
But...

291
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,333
wanting to do a job
just to be close to your love

292
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,067
and things that you want to do
are different, aren't they?

293
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:28,767
For example,

294
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:33,167
if my love is the president
of a company,

295
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,833
I want to be his secretary.

296
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,967
If my love is a pilot,

297
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,267
I want to be...

298
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,600
a flight attendant.

299
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,500
If he's a tennis player,

300
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:24,133
<i>I'll be his manager</i>
<i>to coordinate his schedule.</i>

301
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,700
If he's a college professor...

302
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,467
Give me a call.

303
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,800
<i>...I'll be his assistant</i>

304
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,633
to aid his research.

305
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:16,033
Just like that,
I imagine my future jobs

306
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,433
and dream about it
every now and then.

307
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,567
But there's a problem
in this dream.

308
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,467
Depending on my love's job,

309
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,733
the thing that I want to do
changes all the time.

310
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,633
It's different from what
I really want to do, isn't it?

311
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,733
I can't say that this is
my future dream.

312
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,433
Kin-chan?

313
00:23:56,467 --> 00:24:00,267
So, if your love is a chef,

314
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,500
you'll be a hostess
at his restaurant.

315
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,300
Living your life to support
someone's dream is a good thing.

316
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,400
Men think...

317
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:14,233
they want to make
a woman like that happy.

318
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,200
I'd bet you'd be a great hostess.

319
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,700
Kin-chan, stop joking around.

320
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,067
That was a good one.
May I have this?

321
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,533
I'll try some more.

322
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,133
It's jiggling. Delicious.

323
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,233
JOB SEARCH MATERIALS

324
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,733
<i>Oh, this is it.</i>

325
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,467
<i>Job search materials.</i>

326
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,667
The same as falling in love.

327
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,367
I'll know it naturally, huh?

328
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,267
Even so,
I can't help getting frustrated.

329
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,700
<i>What kind of a book was Irie reading?</i>

330
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:06,233
To find what I want to do,

331
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,800
I wanted to live on my own.

332
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,000
I stay home forever,

333
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:18,667
graduate college,

334
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,167
then take over my dad's business.

335
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,500
Is it really okay just like that?

336
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:29,933
That's just living out the plan
my parents laid out for me.

337
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,100
I feel like...

338
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,333
I was left behind.

339
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,000
Irie.

340
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,167
It's rare to see you studying.

341
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,867
Are you preparing
for the second foreign-language class?

342
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,100
It's a medical book, isn't it?

343
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,033
What's going on?

344
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,767
What changed your mind?

345
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,967
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR PROMOTION

346
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,900
Naoki and Kotoko,

347
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,767
congratulations on being promoted
to sophomores.

348
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,000
Cheers!

349
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:47,700
Cheers!

350
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:49,367
Thank you.

351
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:53,133
Thank you so much.

352
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,567
You're throwing
such a wonderful party for us.

353
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,967
Not at all.

354
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,800
Yuki, you're in 5th grade now.

355
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:02,467
Studying to entering junior high
will become more serious.

356
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,533
Work hard on it!

357
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:06,733
I'll go to Tonan
just like my brother did.

358
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,100
Of course I'll be in class A,

359
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,700
and I'll become number one
like my brother.

360
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,433
Oh, that's very promising.
Right, Iri-chan?

361
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,367
Let's have dinner.

362
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:19,700
-Please eat.
-Let's eat.

363
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,500
-Let's eat.
-Go ahead.

364
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:25,733
-This is great.
-This is your mom's specialty.

365
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,733
-Temari-sushi.
-Eat up.

366
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,533
These are cut so beautifully.

367
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,633
I'm honored
to get praise from a pro.

368
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,267
Naoki, Yuki, eat a lot.

369
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,867
This, this and this.
Here they are.

370
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,600
-This one is really good.
-Right?

371
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,933
Eat this, too.

372
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,767
This one, too.

373
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,800
I can't eat all of them at once.

374
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,567
It's because

375
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:51,633
I worry if you're taking
enough vitamins and calcium.

376
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,533
Eat it all up.

377
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,300
Naoki is not a child anymore.

378
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,633
Honey, have some champagne.

379
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,633
Wow, darling, thank you.

380
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,400
-I'll drink tonight.
-Go ahead.

381
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,600
Your mom looks so happy

382
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,433
since you are here.

383
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,267
-I'll take some, too.
-Then I'll serve you.

384
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,567
Yuki, are you eating?

385
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,467
I'm stuffed.

386
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:21,133
Kotoko, you'll get fat
if you eat that much.

387
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,333
You were eating a lot, too.

388
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm okay.

389
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:27,300
I'm going to grow tall soon.

390
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,933
For you, it's not like you're going
to grow out your boobs.

391
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,000
What?!

392
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,733
You dodged me.

393
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,467
It's nice to have
the whole family together.

394
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,900
There's no place like home.

395
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:49,100
Thank you for including us,
even though we're not your family.

396
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:51,100
What are you talking about?

397
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,367
You're the same as family.

398
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,300
She's right.

399
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,700
About Kotoko and Naoki,

400
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:00,333
I haven't given up yet.

401
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:09,033
Naoki, are you still going
to keep living by yourself?

402
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,233
You must have had your fill.

403
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,467
Why don't you come home soon?

404
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,467
That's right, bro.

405
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:20,133
Right? Then Kotoko and Naoki
can get married

406
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,667
and we'll become a real family.

407
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,433
Are you drunk, Mom?

408
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,767
You're drinking too much.

409
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,933
I'm not drunk.

410
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,800
Right, Kotoko?

411
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:34,900
It's too soon for me to get married.

412
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,667
Why?

413
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,667
When we got married,

414
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,367
I was the same age
as you are now,

415
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:41,933
I9 years old.

416
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,467
It's not too early.

417
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,567
-Right?
-Yeah.

418
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,100
Thank you for dinner.

419
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,500
I have to get going now.

420
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,167
Why?

421
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:00,400
<i>He's right.</i>

422
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:06,567
<i>My presence, for Irie,</i>
<i>is only a nuisance.</i>

423
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,767
Naoki, wait.

424
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,033
I have something
that I want to tell you.

425
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,767
Can you come to the study with me?

426
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:18,600
Please.

427
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,867
Honey, you too.

428
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:28,333
I want you to hear it, too.

429
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
I'm sorry.

430
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,933
I'll leave for now,
but have some tea

431
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,467
and enjoy each other.

432
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:39,100
I'll be back. Sorry. I'm coming!

433
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,033
What is it?

434
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,100
Naoki, what are you thinking
about your future?

435
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:56,967
I want you to tell me
what you really think.

436
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,200
You may have known it already,

437
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:02,633
but I want you

438
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:06,233
to be the official successor
of my company.

439
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,467
After you graduate from college,

440
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:12,267
I want you to join my company.

441
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,433
I agree with him.

442
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,933
You're still a sophomore,

443
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
but it's better to learn
about the job now.

444
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,467
So...

445
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:27,100
like during summer vacation,

446
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:30,200
during the long break,

447
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,933
I want you to learn
about the jobs at my company.

448
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,800
I want your opinion

449
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,667
on managing the company, too.

450
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,800
They're taking too long.

451
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,667
What are they talking about?

452
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,400
Kotoko,
why don't you take them some tea?

453
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Okay.

454
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,600
What do you think, Naoki?

455
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:17,133
Whether I take over
your company or not,

456
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,900
it's not something
that I can decide right now.

457
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:21,800
I need time to think about.

458
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,700
You must've had enough time
to think about.

459
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:43,733
About your dad's company
and also about Kotoko.

460
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,033
Honey, let's set Kotoko aside for now.

461
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,967
No, this is also an important decision
for his future.

462
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:56,133
I'm not recommending Kotoko
to you randomly.

463
00:34:57,267 --> 00:35:00,733
If you are taking over
your dad's company,

464
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,533
Kotoko would be the ideal wife for you.

465
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,100
Right, honey?

466
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:07,900
Certainly...

467
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:11,433
managing a company
is not that easy.

468
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,667
You definitely need a support system.

469
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:17,567
So, you want a girl
who cares about you

470
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:19,600
and supports you.

471
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,867
And, also,

472
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:23,800
a girl who's loved
by people around her is the best.

473
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,100
Marriage is not just falling in love.

474
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,167
In that sense, Kotoko surely is

475
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:36,067
the ideal wife, I think.

476
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:43,500
But the most important thing is...

477
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:44,967
your feelings.

478
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,533
Let me hear your opinion.

479
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,200
What do you think, Naoki?

480
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
Before I tell you what I think,

481
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,200
you both are...

482
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:59,600
...forcing me to act the way you want.

483
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,467
You're pretending to let me choose,

484
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,033
but in reality,

485
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,067
the way I live has already been decided.

486
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,333
From the very beginning.

487
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,500
That's a dirty trick.

488
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:22,167
Dirty trick?

489
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:25,433
Naoki, what are you saying to your dad?

490
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,367
He's thinking about you first.

491
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,367
It's not that he's thinking about me,

492
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,367
he's worried about himself.

493
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,700
How could you...?

494
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,233
You're the same.

495
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,967
Since you like Kotoko,

496
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,367
you're ignoring my feelings.

497
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:40,400
You're blindly trying to get us marry.

498
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:43,267
So, I just told you.

499
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,467
I like Kotoko for many reasons.

500
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:51,967
Besides, you and Kotoko
are meant for each other.

501
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,667
Enough already!

502
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,567
Not only is choosing a job restricted,

503
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,167
but loving someone is as well.

504
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,600
That's why I don't want to be here.

505
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,333
The family that constrains me.

506
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,300
Honey!

507
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:08,467
Calm down.

508
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,167
Sorry, I...

509
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,633
Irie!

510
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:26,267
Irie!

511
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:32,333
-Kotoko, what's wrong with him?
-What happened?

512
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,367
No, nothing.

513
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,867
Irie's coat.

514
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,800
I'll take it to him.

515
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,067
Irie, Irie, your coat!

516
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,133
Irie, that's not the way
to the station.

517
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,200
I'm taking a walk.

518
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,867
Sorry about that.

519
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,767
We showed you our ugly argument.

520
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:16,233
I'm sorry that I ended up
eavesdropping on you.

521
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,900
But I think...

522
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:27,867
Mrs. Irie just lost her temper.

523
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:32,433
You know, you don't...

524
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,800
usually...

525
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:35,667
say much, right?

526
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,467
You don't tell people
what you think.

527
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:45,000
That's why everyone got so frustrated.

528
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:50,500
They didn't know
what you really think...

529
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,000
and became impatient...

530
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,600
and nervous.

531
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,533
That was how it happened,

532
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,033
but both of your parents are...

533
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,367
definitely...

534
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:11,900
treating you as their first priority.

535
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,800
There's no doubt about it.

536
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,233
But I understand how you feel.

537
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,300
You only live once.

538
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:31,067
You want to decide
what to do yourself, don't you?

539
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,900
Right.

540
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,900
I think so.

541
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,133
You've said this before.

542
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:47,800
College is the place
where you find what you want to do.

543
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,767
Have you found one?

544
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,400
Unfortunately,

545
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,100
I haven't yet.

546
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,067
Not only Kin-chan,
but also Jinko and Satomi are

547
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,633
chasing their dreams, but...

548
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm not.

549
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:22,533
<i>My mind is preoccupied with you.</i>

550
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,267
I'm ashamed of myself.

551
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,300
Kin-chan told me...

552
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,633
if I find what I really want to do,

553
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,833
I'll know it without thinking.

554
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:09,067
He said it was the same thing
as falling in love.

555
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:13,733
But...

556
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,833
until you find it,

557
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,867
you feel nothing but anxious.

558
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
Right.

559
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,600
So, I think you're brave.

560
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:32,200
If I was told by my dad

561
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:35,000
to take his restaurant over like that,

562
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:37,033
I would probably give in.

563
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:41,967
But you didn't.

564
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,000
So...

565
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,133
So...

566
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:59,433
not only your job...

567
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,733
but also your love...

568
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,733
Not only is choosing a job restricted,

569
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,900
but loving someone is as well.

570
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:12,133
Without being pressured,

571
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:15,733
you should be able to do what you want.

572
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,833
So, do what's best for you.

573
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:28,667
Falling in love with someone
is not written in a book.

574
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,567
Even if people tell you that,

575
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,400
it's better to do it this way.

576
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,200
If it's someone you can't love,

577
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:38,933
then there's nothing
you can do about it.

578
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,100
Irie, you should...

579
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,167
choose someone you really love
and be happy.

580
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,367
I...

581
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,700
want to be a doctor.

582
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,933
I'm planning on taking a test
to transfer to medical school.

583
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:04,167
I don't know if it's for me...

584
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:09,333
but I want to study it properly.

585
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,533
Human life is...

586
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,167
dependent upon a momentary decision.

587
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,833
<i>A little thing can lead...</i>

588
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,467
<i>to easily curable from incurable.</i>

589
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,467
<i>I was scared, too.</i>

590
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:28,333
<i>Until now, I thought that life was...</i>

591
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,700
<i>decided by God...</i>

592
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:34,833
<i>and humans could do nothing about it.</i>

593
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:38,867
Being a doctor is...

594
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,700
the job that interests me
for the first time in my life.

595
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:51,200
Why didn't you say that to your dad?

596
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,133
Until just now...

597
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,000
I still wasn't sure about it.

598
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,000
Just now?

599
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,500
When did you decide it, then?

600
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,733
While I was taking a walk now.

601
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,933
I guess.

602
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:16,967
But I don't want
to tell my parents just yet.

603
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:18,367
Why is that?

604
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:21,500
I want to get ready.

605
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:25,533
I want to tell them
when I can take action.

606
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,467
So, you too,

607
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,033
don't tell anyone else about it.

608
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,000
Got it.

609
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,200
But...

610
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,333
why did you tell me
such an important thing?

611
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,200
Well...

612
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:49,700
I don't know why.

613
00:44:58,633 --> 00:44:59,800
Is this the station?

614
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:04,200
Why, we went a different way.

615
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:07,933
To get to your destination,

616
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,933
there are different paths you can take.

617
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,833
Even if it looks like a detour,

618
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,400
you may find something important
along the way.

619
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,633
See you later, Kotoko.

620
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:40,667
Irie.

621
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,667
<i>An important thing like that...</i>

622
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:50,300
<i>why did he just tell me about it?</i>

623
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:57,833
<i>You can make things happen.</i>

624
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,233
Developing new medicines or...

625
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:03,900
becoming a doctor...

626
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:05,900
and curing diseases like magic.

627
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,800
I'm...

628
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,933
the worst mother in the world!

629
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,700
We're a family.

630
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:19,700
There are times when we'll fight.

631
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,567
Even so...

632
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,800
Honey.

633
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:34,433
Honey, I have something important
to tell you.

634
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,867
What?

635
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:40,200
Actually,

636
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:43,600
I wanted to tell Naoki, too.

637
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:46,500
To be honest...

638
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:50,367
Darling.

639
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:53,467
Darling?

640
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:59,000
Darling, are you okay?!

641
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,333
Naoki, Naoki!

642
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:05,600
Darling, darling, are you okay?
Hang in there.

643
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:16,900
-Darling.
-Iri-chan.

644
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,733
-What's wrong?
-Dad!

645
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,200
Don't give in.

646
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:22,433
Darling.

647
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:24,267
Darling!

648
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:26,867
-Iri-chan.
-Don't leave us.

649
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:28,433
Darling.

650
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:23,033
I'm the deputy president now.

651
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,267
What's going to happen
to Dad's company?

652
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:27,100
I'll protect Dad's company.

653
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:31,167
I'd like to discuss the investment
in your company.

654
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:33,367
We might be merged into them.

655
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:36,500
We're like newlyweds.

656
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:40,633
In that kind of situation,
Kotoko and Irie may get close.

657
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,333
Is Matsumoto confessing
her love to Irie?!

658
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,533
-No!
-Have you...

659
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,833
-given up on Kotoko?
-Stop kidding.

660
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,767
Naoki, do you want to have
a marriage meeting?

661
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:53,433
It's a good deal
for the company, right?

662
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,567
{\an8}If I take over the company,
everything will be solved.

663
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:58,267
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

664
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,000
{\an8}Are you giving up
on becoming a doctor?
