1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,667
Don't be so arrogant.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,633
-Irie.
-Sorry, I got to go.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,433
I'm running with Irie.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,800
It's like a dream.

5
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,033
I'm saying that

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,133
being in the same house
with you

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,033
doesn't bother me.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,933
Does that mean you...

9
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,233
don't hate me?

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,667
You're hard to deal with,

11
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,500
but I don't hate you.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,467
No, I'm against it.

13
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:42,567
Kotoko's finally back, but now
you're moving out?

14
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,733
Why don't you try it.

15
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,433
Thank you.

16
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,767
I'm going now.

17
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,633
Naoki, take good care
of your health.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,633
Eat enough vegetables. Also...

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,567
I know, I know.

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,233
See you later.

21
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,667
Augh!

22
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,467
He really left.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,333
Irie has moved out?

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,033
He's renting a place

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,800
and he'll work for his living expenses.

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,200
Where is Irie now?

27
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,533
I don't know.

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,767
How about his part-time job?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,600
What kind of job does he have?

30
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:26,733
I don't know that either.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,533
That sounds like you guys
are complete strangers.

32
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,567
Hey Kin-chan, what's this?

33
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a celebration gift.

34
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,433
Irie moved out, right?

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,367
What's better to celebrate?

36
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,333
I won this battle.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,533
Irie must have given up
on the Kotoko finally.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,567
Wait, Kin-chan.

39
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,333
You don't know anything about
how Kotoko feels.

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,867
What are you doing here?
Just go away.

41
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,200
Kotoko, I'm on your side.

42
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,367
I'll eat this.

43
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,167
Kin-chan doesn't know anything.

44
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:14,200
I think what Kin-chan's saying
is right.

45
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,433
Satomi.

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,533
Because Irie is a man, too.

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,800
If he had any feelings towards
Kotoko,

48
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,367
he wouldn't have moved out
of the house.

49
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,067
See, look at Kin-chan.

50
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:29,400
People want to be close
to who they love.

51
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:35,333
<i>Right after he said</i>
<i>he didn't hate me,</i>

52
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,133
<i>he moved out of the house.</i>

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,533
<i>Is he trying to avoid me?</i>

54
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,467
<i>What's Irie's true feelings?</i>

55
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:50,133
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

56
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,333
{\an8}TONAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL
OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

57
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,667
{\an8}WHEN YOU GIVE UP ON YOUR LOVE

58
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,700
{\an8}You still can't stop coming here
to spy on him.

59
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,000
Because I can see him only
at college.

60
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:08,033
Kotoko, you're so stupid.

61
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,333
Yeah, she really is.

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,567
Why am I stupid?

63
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,533
-S.T.U.P.I.D, stupid.
-Right.

64
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,233
S.T.U.P.I.D?

65
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,500
Stupid!

66
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,567
-Stupid, stupid.
-No, I'm.

67
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,633
Hey, you're Irie's.

68
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,233
Hello.

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Too bad. Irie already left.

70
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,533
He went to work.

71
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:32,167
Oh, what kind of a job did he say?

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,967
We asked him too,

73
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,400
but he didn't tell us.

74
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,100
Irie is somewhat secretive.

75
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,067
Sorry that we can't help.

76
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,700
I see.

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,133
Are they twins?

78
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,933
They must be brothers.

79
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,000
No, twins.

80
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,133
No way. Are they twins?

81
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,633
Go for it.

82
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,133
Go for it.

83
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,067
Kotoko Aihara.

84
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:10,233
Kotoko Aihara.

85
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,500
The feelings of the balls.

86
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,367
One who's lazy at picking balls

87
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,433
get her regular position
taken away.

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Remember that.

89
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,033
-You!
-Yes.

90
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,767
Be clear if you're hot or cold.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,967
You're in the tennis club, right?

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,300
Gather the balls.

93
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,867
You guys are members, right?

94
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,633
He's not going to come.

95
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
You try it!

96
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm sorry to serve you
things like these.

97
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,233
My wife has errands
and she's not here.

98
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,167
No, it's delicious.

99
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,467
Really? Eat them.

100
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,933
Thank you for the dinner.

101
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:10,033
What's up, Yuki? You haven't
eaten much.

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,700
I have no appetite.

103
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,300
Oh...

104
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,833
you don't?

105
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:19,133
If that's the case,
this will happen.

106
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,433
I wonder if Yuki misses Naoki.

107
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,600
<i>Even though he gave me</i>
<i>a cold shoulder</i>

108
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,100
<i>and being sarcastic,</i>

109
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,467
<i>I was with him all the time.</i>

110
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,400
<i>The distance between Irie and I</i>

111
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,900
<i>will get farther and farther.</i>

112
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,600
Kotoko-chan.

113
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:17,867
Yes.

114
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,633
Kotoko-chan, Kotoko-chan.

115
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,167
I found out.

116
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,400
What?

117
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,333
"What?" did you say?

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,967
Of course where Naoki works.

119
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,567
How did you?

120
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:36,167
It's impossible for him to have
a secret against me.

121
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,567
I wonder who you are.

122
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,367
Anyway...

123
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:46,000
you and I
should go to his work

124
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,900
and spy on him.

125
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,667
I will.

126
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,933
I'll come too.

127
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,567
Yuki, were you listening?

128
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,167
More than Kotoko,

129
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,467
I'm worrying about my brother.
I want to see him too.

130
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,333
Okay. Then,

131
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,433
let's spy on him
with three of us.

132
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,300
-Yes.
-Yeah.

133
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,467
-Yes.
-Yes.

134
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,567
Let's do it!

135
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:13,767
We'll make it happen.

136
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,100
All right.

137
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,767
Ricotta cheese pancake
with bananas and...

138
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,933
the drink is...

139
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,133
Original blend tea.

140
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,800
Okay.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,067
-Low-- Low fat milk.
-What?

142
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,900
-What?
-Yes.

143
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,867
What? What?

144
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,233
-I'll take over.
-Thanks.

145
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,133
{\an8}He's so cool.

146
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,233
That's my brother all over.

147
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,467
Excuse me.

148
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,767
Waiter, over here, please.

149
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,567
Yes. Ready to order?

150
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,233
Not you,

151
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,467
but the other guy over there.

152
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:32,833
Excuse me.

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,067
Hey, waiter, over here.

154
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,867
What would you like?

155
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,900
-What will be good?
-I'll take this one.

156
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,233
Do something with your obvious
disguise, mom.

157
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,000
How did you know?

158
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,500
I don't understand your nerve
to think that it's a disguise.

159
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:56,500
Because, not only where you work,

160
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,267
but also your address is
kept secret from us.

161
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:03,833
I'm working now so stop having
a private conversation.

162
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,167
Is your order two coffee
and one orange juice?

163
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,400
I'll be back.

164
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:30,967
Why?

165
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,033
-I don't see my brother.
-What?

166
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,667
He might have gone
to the bathroom.

167
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,233
Excuse me.

168
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
Where's Naoki Irie?

169
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,467
Irie is done with his shift today.

170
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,700
He left without saying
anything to us?

171
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:54,500
He didn't give us
his new address.

172
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,100
Mrs. Irie, let's go home.

173
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:01,233
I'm happy with seeing Irie
doing well.

174
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,733
You're right.

175
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,867
Kotoko.

176
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,133
Look at that.

177
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,000
NOW HIRING
PART TIME WAITRESSES

178
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:18,567
Mrs. Irie, I'll work here.
That way I'll be close to Irie.

179
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,733
Great idea, Kotoko.

180
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Yes.

181
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,000
Excuse me, I'm applying for
that job.

182
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,200
NOW HIRING
PART TIME WAITRESSES

183
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,433
-This way, please.
-Yes.

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,333
Manager.

185
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,933
Another applicant
for the part time job.

186
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,433
Oh, I'm sorry.

187
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,667
I just hired this lady.

188
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,700
Ms. Matsumoto.

189
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,867
Wow, what a coincidence, Kotoko.

190
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:10,233
How did you know that
Irie worked here?

191
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,533
I was told

192
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,967
by him.

193
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,833
He did?

194
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,367
Mrs. Irie.

195
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:37,533
Kotoko, how was your job interview?

196
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,933
I didn't make it.

197
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:44,000
A girl who was in Engineering
with Irie applied for it earlier.

198
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,267
So she was hired.

199
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,133
It's probably...

200
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,200
that girl.

201
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
Yuko Matsumoto.

202
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
Mrs. Irie, when did you...

203
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,767
I told you. The one who controls
information

204
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,033
controls the world.

205
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,467
She's fairly good looking

206
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:19,467
and has a nice figure
and must be kind of smart,

207
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:22,567
but she is out of question.

208
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,433
She's not for Naoki.

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,033
Do you think so?

210
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,833
Of course. She must know that.

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,967
That's why she got into
his work

212
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,433
and is trying hard to sell herself.

213
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,567
I was going to go into
where he worked too.

214
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:43,200
Anyway, you're the best fit
for Naoki.

215
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:46,500
I, who raised Naoki,
am saying that so it's true.

216
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,500
A girl like her.
You can just kick her out.

217
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,900
Mrs. Irie.

218
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,133
The knife.

219
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,800
This one?

220
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,267
I was filleting a mackerel.

221
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,033
A mackerel.

222
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,233
Yuko Matsumoto works
at where Irie works?

223
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:12,367
Not only that, she heard that Irie
was working there from Irie himself.

224
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,333
But why? The Engineering guys
were saying that.

225
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,633
We asked him,

226
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,067
but he wouldn't tell us.

227
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,767
Irie is somewhat secretive.

228
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,133
Right.

229
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:31,533
He was hiding about his work
to his mom.

230
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,167
However, he told Yuko Matsumoto
about his job.

231
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,500
I understand that.

232
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,267
When someone changes his way
of living,

233
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,733
there's some kind
of motivation.

234
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,300
See, when Kotoko started tennis,

235
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,900
you were influenced by Irie, right?

236
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,433
That means

237
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,333
the reason for Irie to start
living by himself

238
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,700
is Yuko Matsumoto?

239
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,267
No way! Because Irie told me that

240
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,933
he doesn't hate me.

241
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,767
I may sound cruel,

242
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:06,167
but not hating you

243
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,167
and loving you are totally
different. Do you understand?

244
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:13,533
Irie has been hating women.

245
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,300
If that kind of a guy

246
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,933
falls in love with someone.

247
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,933
If something big like that
didn't happen,

248
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,333
he wouldn't have decided
to leave his comfortable home.

249
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,800
I agree.

250
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,267
AIHARA
WE'RE GETTING READY

251
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,733
What's wrong?

252
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,133
It's rare for you to come here
on your own.

253
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,500
I wanted to eat the food you cook.

254
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,033
You used to come and eat here often
when you were little. There.

255
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,167
Wow, looks delicious!

256
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,767
Kotoko, since you're here
let's eat together.

257
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,233
Kinnosuke, you are eating
with me in the back.

258
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,300
-Why not?
-Just come.

259
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,000
Thank you for this meal.

260
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,200
It's delicious.

261
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,200
I know.

262
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
About Naoki, right?

263
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,000
Iri-chan said there was nothing
to do with us,

264
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:35,600
but he moved out right after
we came back.

265
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,967
I was wondering too.

266
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,833
I wonder Irie hates me
more than I think.

267
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,867
What are you talking about?

268
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,267
You are the one who decided
to keep on going no matter what.

269
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,933
If you've decided once,
do it without complaining.

270
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,433
That's what you've decided.

271
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,433
I got it.

272
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,400
I came here because I really
wanted to eat your food.

273
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:16,400
It's the best.

274
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,500
Thank you for the meal.

275
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,767
See you, Kotoko.

276
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,567
I'll come back soon again.

277
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,100
-Chef.
-Yeah.

278
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,700
Aren't you little harsh?

279
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:37,933
What?

280
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,767
Kotoko is suffering now.

281
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,633
She's not a little girl anymore.

282
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
It's not something that parents
have a say on it.

283
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:56,433
I will help her
when she's really in trouble.

284
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,133
So that I can protect her,

285
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,833
I can sit here and wait until then.

286
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,600
That's what parents are all about.

287
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,600
Don't worry about us,

288
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:14,567
but you should establish yourself
soon to make your parents proud.

289
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,633
Yes.

290
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,833
DAIKANYAMA STATION

291
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:34,700
Okay... go.

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,833
-I'll help you.
-Thank you.

293
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:27,667
I'm going to wait outside
until he's done working.

294
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,133
<i>Pokey poke, turn around</i>

295
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,567
<i>pokey poke, turn.</i>

296
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,933
There he is.

297
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,800
Okay.

298
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,000
Is he waiting for somebody?

299
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,833
It can't be.

300
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,733
Sorry for having you wait.

301
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
No.

302
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,300
It's on the corner over there.
Have you been there?

303
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:52,467
No.

304
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,400
Their pasta is really good.

305
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,267
Salads are good as well.

306
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:00,333
I see. Irie is riding a train
to go home.

307
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,433
I got it. He's okay.

308
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,933
He's going home.

309
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,700
How long is she going to be
with him?

310
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,267
Irie, do you like amusement parks?

311
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,033
Yeah, but I don't go there often.

312
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,233
I see.

313
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:33,233
Is Irie's apartment
close to Matsumoto's?

314
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:38,667
Did he start living by himself
so that he can live close to her?

315
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:46,333
No, It's close
to Tonan University here.

316
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,367
It's normal for him to rent a room
close to school.

317
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,667
What would you like for dinner
tonight?

318
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,233
I haven't thought about it.

319
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Well, then...

320
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,167
how about beef stroganoff?

321
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,233
-Sounds good.
-Let's go.

322
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,333
Beef...?

323
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:26,067
Beef... teck apple... geoise.

324
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,200
She's going to cook that one?

325
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,200
No, no, no.

326
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,100
{\an8}MATSUMOTO

327
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,700
{\an8}Matsumoto?

328
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,433
What? They live together?

329
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,367
Eat it up.

330
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,700
Good morning.

331
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:17,200
Good morning.

332
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:20,100
What happened, Kotoko?

333
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,667
Nothing.

334
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,167
But your face.

335
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,133
I couldn't sleep very well
last night.

336
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:36,500
You're stupid and look
like a monster now.

337
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,267
My brother is not going to
like you being like that.

338
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,767
Stop it.

339
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,600
Thank you for warning me.

340
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,867
I got to be careful.

341
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
What?

342
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,300
Well,

343
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,767
I'm going now.

344
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,800
Wait, Kotoko.

345
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,200
What about breakfast?

346
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:16,433
Is she going to be okay?

347
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,667
They live together?

348
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:25,233
I didn't know that they were
that serious.

349
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, but...

350
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,367
it can be false information.

351
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:31,700
You may have misunderstood
something.

352
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,033
I waited in front of the house
for three hours.

353
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:36,933
Three hours?

354
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,033
I'm impressed with your
determination.

355
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,533
Irie never came out of Matsumoto's
place the whole time.

356
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,700
It would've been little too long
if he just took her home.

357
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,833
They're living together for sure.

358
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,500
If he lives in her home, her parents
must be accepting him.

359
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:59,933
It makes sense that Irie didn't tell
his new address to his mom.

360
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:03,767
A college student moves out of his
house and live with a girl's family.

361
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,500
He can't say that.

362
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Kotoko?

363
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,833
Are you okay?

364
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,433
I'm okay.

365
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,567
I'm okay.

366
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,533
I have to go to class.

367
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,733
What?

368
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,633
Kotoko.

369
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,900
Hey Irie.

370
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,600
Long time no see.

371
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,033
I felt like sweating a little.

372
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,900
Oh, today...

373
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:12,233
Aihara is not here.
She's not feeling well.

374
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,467
So she's absent.

375
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,200
Really.

376
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:19,233
Her tennis skill hasn't improved,
but her body is sturdy.

377
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,867
She has never missed practices.

378
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:28,733
Irie.

379
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,967
Let's practice together
over here.

380
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,367
Sure.

381
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:35,767
Later.

382
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,667
Brother.

383
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:47,267
-Hey. Are you doing well?
-Yeah.

384
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,400
What's going on?

385
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:51,667
Nothing.

386
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,867
I wanted to see you
after a long time.

387
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,667
Besides I'm wondering about
how it's like at home.

388
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,233
Speaking of which, there's something
wrong with Kotoko.

389
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,233
Her? What's wrong?

390
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,033
I don't know.

391
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,567
She looks pale and dazed.

392
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,767
She doesn't eat much either.

393
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:18,333
When I tease her,
she has no response.

394
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:21,033
It's not fun at all.

395
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
It's just like

396
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,267
pushing a curtain,
an Iron clamp on Tofu.

397
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,100
Nails into rice bran.

398
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:01,133
There, there...

399
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Chinese and Western. I got
desserts too.

400
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,200
If there are this many choices,
you'll be able to eat something.

401
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:09,767
Kotoko. Don't hesitate.
Eat them up.

402
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,733
These are from Kin-chan and us.

403
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,900
How long are you frowning
like that?

404
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:19,000
You have to take nutrition
or new love won't come.

405
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,333
I understand that you're
broken hearted.

406
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,600
He's not the only guy.

407
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:26,633
Right. Look around.

408
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,367
A nice guy is
right in front of you.

409
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:31,000
Kin-chan, stop selling yourself
for now.

410
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:34,367
Right. Mr. Kin-chan acted
too quickly.

411
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,300
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

412
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:37,900
Kotoko.

413
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:40,133
Start from something
you can eat.

414
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,767
There, there.

415
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:43,533
Thank you.

416
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:45,967
But...

417
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:48,933
I really don't have an appetite.

418
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:52,000
So please...

419
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,567
you guys eat these.

420
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,233
Kotoko, are you okay?

421
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,933
Are you okay? Kotoko?

422
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,133
There.

423
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,667
I won't forgive Irie.

424
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,033
-Where are you going, Kin-chan?
-Of course, to see Irie.

425
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,233
I'll show him.

426
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,767
Listen. You're a part-timer,
but a faculty of this college.

427
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:34,233
If you hurt a student,
you'll be fired from the cafeteria.

428
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,967
You can't be close to Kotoko.

429
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,300
Just hold your emotion now.

430
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,933
We'll take care of Kotoko somehow.

431
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,600
Right. You're right.

432
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,700
-Let's eat. We'll eat now.
-Let's eat.

433
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,633
-You need some sugar.
-Sugar? I need more mustard.

434
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,433
-I think it's sugar.
-Give me some dessert, then.

435
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:57,933
Kotoko.

436
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,733
Kin-chan went to get his car.

437
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,267
Doctor, how's Kotoko doing?

438
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,600
She's got fatigue
and lack of nutrition.

439
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,467
She'll be better once she eats
something easy to digest and rest.

440
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,633
I called her family.

441
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,900
You both should go home.

442
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,633
Thank you, doctor.

443
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,267
Thank you.

444
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:42,933
But considering her fainting in
this degree,

445
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,567
she must have had something
that shocked her mentally.

446
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:51,633
Shocked her mentally.

447
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,300
That guy. I won't forgive him.

448
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,167
Naoki Irie.

449
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,367
Is Naoki Irie here?

450
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,900
Move over. Get out of my way.

451
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,900
Hey, come with us.

452
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,633
I have something to tell you.

453
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,867
Who are you?

454
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,500
We were in the same high school.

455
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,533
Even though you got 200 IQ,

456
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,100
you don't remember us?

457
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:52,733
I don't remember something
that's a waste.

458
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,867
He's so annoying.

459
00:33:57,867 --> 00:33:59,133
I remember.

460
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:02,100
You have same level brains
with Kotoko.

461
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,000
Jinko and Satomi?

462
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:06,433
The other way.

463
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,933
-I'm Jinko.
-Satomi.

464
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:10,700
What do you want?

465
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,867
About Kotoko.

466
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,400
Right.

467
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,167
Aren't you too cruel?

468
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,500
Lately,

469
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,367
Kotoko's been hurt

470
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,500
because of you.

471
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,100
-Because of me?
-Do you think we don't know?

472
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,300
About you living...

473
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,267
with her.

474
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,700
Poor thing.

475
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:35,033
Kotoko followed you
and Matsumoto.

476
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,967
She saw it with her own eyes.

477
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,633
In front of her house,

478
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,167
she waited for three hours.

479
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,933
Although you know Kotoko's feelings
towards you,

480
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,900
you moved out of the house

481
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,167
and are living with someone secretly.

482
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,433
It's so cowardly.

483
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,767
Don't leave her in limbo.
If you are a man,

484
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:57,433
tell her straightforward.

485
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,267
Should I tell her straightforward?

486
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,600
Consider the way to deliver it.

487
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:10,467
Right.

488
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,600
If you learned how to love,

489
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,067
then now you understand
feelings of a human

490
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:18,500
a little bit, right?

491
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:23,267
Anyway, don't make Kotoko
suffer anymore.

492
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:26,933
I won't

493
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,333
tell you to stop loving Matsumoto.

494
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,367
But at least

495
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,067
if there's no chance,

496
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,567
I want you to lead her to
give up on you.

497
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:39,967
Please.

498
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,467
Please.

499
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:49,533
Anyway,

500
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,067
that's what we wanted
to tell you. Bye.

501
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,233
Bye.

502
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,200
I see.

503
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:06,400
AIHARA

504
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:07,800
Here we are.

505
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,567
Are you okay, Kotoko?

506
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:24,700
I'm okay.

507
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:29,733
Sorry, you have to go to work.

508
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,767
See you later.

509
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,033
Kotoko.

510
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:50,267
I'm right here for you.

511
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,700
Kin-chan.

512
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:56,067
Always, anytime,

513
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,633
I'll be close to you.

514
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,533
I'll be right here.

515
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
So...

516
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,333
That's all.

517
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,233
Get well soon.

518
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,100
Kin-chan.

519
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,000
Sorry.

520
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,233
It's not the situation
for you to apologize.

521
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,733
Then...

522
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:34,367
Eat well and go to bed early.

523
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:14,800
<i>Does that mean that</i>
<i>you don't hate me?</i>

524
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,033
You're hard to deal with, but...

525
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,300
I don't hate you.

526
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:52,500
<i>How long are you frowning?</i>

527
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,267
You have to take nutrition
to find a new love.

528
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,600
I understand that you're
broken hearted,

529
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,867
but he's not the only guy.

530
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,367
Kotoko.

531
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,533
I'm right here for you.

532
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:16,267
<i>What am I doing?</i>

533
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:33,000
Kotoko, are you okay?

534
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,633
Shall I drive you to school?

535
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm really okay.

536
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,133
I'm going now.

537
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,933
Enjoy your day.

538
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:15,233
I have to pull myself together.

539
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,733
I have to become okay for real.

540
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:24,267
Any more...

541
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,267
I can't cause trouble for everyone.

542
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:32,800
All right. I'll cheer myself up.
Yeah.

543
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
Good morning.

544
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,267
Wait.

545
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,500
Come with me.

546
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,567
How do you like your new place?

547
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,167
It's nice. It's big, so...

548
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,567
Of course, it's such a mansion.

549
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,967
It must be big.

550
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,967
How are you doing with meals?

551
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,967
I eat at a cafe or have something
made for me.

552
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,000
As I thought.

553
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:52,200
Listen.

554
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,167
I think it's wonderful
to fall in love.

555
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,900
What are you saying all of a sudden?

556
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,167
I've been

557
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,367
in unrequited love with you.

558
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:18,067
It may have been a nuisance
to you, but...

559
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:20,867
I could accomplish things
because of that.

560
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,533
If I stayed as I was,

561
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,167
I may have not been able
to get into Tonan University.

562
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,467
I know that

563
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,733
it might be nothing for you,

564
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:38,467
but it was a big deal for me.

565
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,567
Summarize what you want to say.

566
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,767
I mean...

567
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,933
If you have somebody you love,
I want to be happy about it.

568
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,767
Of course I'm disappointed,

569
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:03,000
but if you like Matsumoto
and she likes you,

570
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:07,200
then if you live happily together then
I'm good with it.

571
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,000
I'll back you up.

572
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,300
Naoki.

573
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:18,500
Who is she?

574
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:21,300
Is this...

575
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:22,833
Kotoko Aihara?

576
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,167
How do you know my name?

577
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,900
That's what I thought.

578
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:30,067
I recognized you because you're
just like what I've heard.

579
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:34,033
You look unintelligent and clumsy.

580
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,167
How rude!

581
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,933
Who's saying stuff like that?

582
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,867
Naoki and my sister.

583
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:45,133
Your sister?

584
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:51,700
Is your sister possibly...

585
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,167
Right. It's me.

586
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,800
Yuko Matsumoto?

587
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:07,433
I'm Ayako Matsumoto.
Senior in high school.

588
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:12,700
Didn't you hear about us
from Naoki?

589
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:17,167
Then maybe I can tell you.

590
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:23,000
Naoki comes to our house and...

591
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,433
I know.

592
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,433
He lives together, right?

593
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,367
I wish you every happiness,
Matsumoto.

594
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:31,367
What are you talking about?

595
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:34,867
Naoki is tutoring me at
our house.

596
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,533
He's tutoring?

597
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,300
I'm applying for Tonan University
next year.

598
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:44,967
So my sister introduced him to me
and three times a week,

599
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:47,800
Naoki is tutoring me.

600
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,500
It's a good part-time job
at the Matsumotos.

601
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,133
Meals are included.

602
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:58,167
Beef strongano... beef sto--

603
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,333
What?

604
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,767
How do you know?

605
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,300
Beef stroganoff.

606
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
What's wrong with her?
Is she crying?

607
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:13,633
Are you okay?

608
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,667
She's little different, you know.

609
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:21,000
Anyway, Naoki and sis, why don't you
tour me around the college?

610
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,633
I came here for that today.

611
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:34,000
So, what did you say?

612
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,067
You approve that Matsumoto and I
live together.

613
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,867
You are going to back us up, right?

614
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:44,300
No, no, no.
I'm taking back what I just said.

615
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,400
I'm strongly against it.

616
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:48,067
You're so loud.

617
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,433
I moved out to be
all by myself.

618
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,733
Why do I even bother living
with someone?

619
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:57,767
See you, Kotoko.

620
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:10,167
Alrighty!

621
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,400
Matsumoto.

622
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:12,767
Matsumoto, Matsumoto.

623
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,567
Matsumoto.

624
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:18,500
Hey, you guys. Here's a racket.

625
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:22,133
Matsumoto.

626
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,633
Hey where's Yuko Matsumoto?
Where did she go?

627
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,167
Irie.

628
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,800
He wasn't living with Matsumoto.

629
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:30,000
What?

630
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,467
Do they live together?

631
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:32,667
That Irie guy...

632
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,867
-I won't forgive him.
-Mr. Sudo, wait!

633
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:39,500
No. Irie is still free.

634
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,633
He has been and he will be.

635
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,300
He's been free the whole time.

636
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:45,633
So you too

637
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,333
should be happy.

638
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,167
I don't know what you're
talking about,

639
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,900
but good for you.
Congrats.

640
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:54,100
But...

641
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:58,600
why did Matsumoto tell me that
she heard about his job from him?

642
00:46:58,767 --> 00:46:59,767
What?

643
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,233
I'm the one who told her about
Irie's job.

644
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:06,367
I'm the one who introduced
that restaurant to Irie.

645
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,633
What? Does that mean that

646
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,467
Matsumoto lied to me?

647
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,433
How did you know that
Irie works here?

648
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,233
I was told...

649
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,133
by him.

650
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:28,933
Okay.

651
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,167
I see.

652
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:33,267
You're a man, too.

653
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,700
You're "him" also.

654
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:37,800
Are you sure you're okay?

655
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:39,900
I don't know what you're
talking about.

656
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,367
I'm okay.

657
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:44,200
Mr. Sudo. I'm hungry.
Can you buy me some food?

658
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,567
Why is that?
Why do I have to buy you food?

659
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:48,167
Why don't you buy me every
once in a while.

660
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,467
No way. I have no money.

661
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:52,900
I entered there.

662
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:56,933
To the store that had a lot of hats.

663
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,267
<i>In the end, I misunderstood</i>
<i>that they lived together.</i>

664
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,700
<i>I'm so glad that it was</i>
<i>a misunderstanding.</i>

665
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,467
<i>But if so,</i>

666
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,733
<i>why did Irie start living</i>
<i>by himself?</i>

667
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:15,933
It's okay.

668
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,800
-I see. It's okay, huh?
-Yes.

669
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,100
Are you sure?

670
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,800
Of course.

671
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,667
I think it's good.

672
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,167
I'm going now.

673
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,100
Are you sure you'll be okay
just the two of you?

674
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,233
We'll be okay. It's only one night.

675
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,767
-What's wrong?
-Yuki, hang in there.

676
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:05,333
He needs an operation.

677
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,967
I'll find Irie and take him here.

678
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,367
Matsumoto may know something.

679
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:11,500
We'll get there no matter what.

680
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,833
You should have told your contact
number to your family.

681
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,967
I was a nuisance to you today.

682
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:17,967
-Where's Kotoko?
-She's maybe at...

683
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,067
-Naoki's place.
-Do you want to take a shower?

684
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:24,000
{\an8}What am I thinking in this crisis?

685
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:25,467
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
