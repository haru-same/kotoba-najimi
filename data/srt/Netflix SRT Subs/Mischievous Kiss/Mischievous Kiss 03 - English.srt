1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,333
I am Kotoko Aihara of Class F.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,267
Could you please read this letter?

3
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:09,967
-No thank you.
-Rejecting Kotoko? I will punish him.

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,767
This means a war.

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:15,167
When you move, luck may turn
in your favor.

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
A shooting star?

7
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:22,400
It got hit by a shooting star?

8
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:26,733
<i>I ended up living with a family of my</i>
<i>dad's best friend.</i>

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,967
<i>-But it turned out...</i>
-What's wrong with you, Kotoko?

10
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,333
Hi, I am--

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,767
<i>It turned out to be a family of Naoki</i>
<i>Irie, whom I really liked.</i>

12
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,467
Tell no one that we live together. Do not
talk to me at school at all.

13
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,067
You don't need to humiliate me that much.

14
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:47,133
I don't like a stupid girl.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,433
I will beat Naoki Irie with term-end
exams.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,033
-Give it to me.
-We have a week until the exams.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
-Help me study.
-Kotoko may be

18
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,900
much more awesome than I think.

19
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,467
I can't believe it. 100th?

20
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:07,200
I suspect that her new house holds some
secrets.

21
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,967
What is this?

22
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,833
Do you live at Naoki Irie's house?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,100
-Aihara.
-What?

24
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,500
Just come.

25
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,400
<i>Our secret of living together was out.</i>

26
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,933
<i>Everybody in our school is gossiping</i>
<i>about us.</i>

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,867
What are your friends thinking?

28
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:32,433
Since you like me, it would be okay for
you, but this bothers me a lot.

29
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,033
Do not disturb my life anymore.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,333
I...

31
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,167
am crying? Why?

32
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:59,533
<i>Since Irie had rejected me flatly,</i>

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,133
<i>I didn't think that I would care how</i>
<i>he treated me anymore.</i>

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,233
<i>Then why am I crying?</i>

35
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,067
After all...

36
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,767
I think I still love him.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,033
Kotoko, you are so late.

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,367
-I was worried about you.
-Sorry.

39
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:59,967
I should have called you earlier.
I'm really sorry.

40
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,300
<i>This is the first love letter</i>
<i>I wrote in my life.</i>

41
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,933
<i>But this love letter has no reader.</i>

42
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,767
No thank you.

43
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:53,333
<i>I know he is a jerk, but...</i>

44
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,767
<i>I still love him. Why?</i>

45
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:08,733
Hey, take a bath.

46
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:17,233
I'm coming in.
My mom wants you to take a bath.

47
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:35,200
<i>Dear Mr. Irie.</i>
<i>I am Kotoko Aihara of Class F.</i>

48
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,733
<i>You may not know me.</i>

49
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>But I know you well.</i>

50
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:48,000
<i>I've been in love with you for two years</i>
<i>since the entrance ceremony.</i>

51
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:51,933
<i>I felt like I was struck</i>
<i>by a shooting star</i>

52
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,500
<i>when I saw you for the first time.</i>

53
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:58,733
<i>This special feeling</i>
<i>has stayed in my heart.</i>

54
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,567
<i>I love</i>

55
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,467
<i>you.</i>

56
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,500
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

57
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:17,100
{\an8}MORNING COFFEE
IS THE AROMA OF LOVE!?

58
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,300
Good morning.

59
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,133
Good morning, Kotoko.

60
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,367
You overslept as usual. Why don't you
wake up early to help her?

61
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,567
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

62
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,367
Neither of my sons will help me at all.

63
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,600
-Have breakfast.
-Okay.

64
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,000
Bon appetite.

65
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,033
Hey, Kotoko.

66
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,667
Can you leave school early today?

67
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,233
Sure, but why?

68
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,400
I want to pay them back
for their kindness.

69
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,200
I would like to cook dinner
for them tonight.

70
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,833
-So I want you to help me.
-I see.

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,100
That's right.
Your restaurant is closed today.

72
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,700
Mr. Aihara, don't be bothered.

73
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,067
I just want to show you my appreciation.

74
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:39,367
Ai-chan is a great chef, so I can't wait.

75
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,400
Right, Naoki and Yuki?

76
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,433
You are right.

77
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm done. See you, everyone.

78
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,067
-Have a great day.
-Have a great day.

79
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,200
Kotoko, you have to leave, too.

80
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,900
What?

81
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,833
You have bread crumb on the face.

82
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,567
What was that?

83
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
HIGH SCHOOL AFFILIATED
TO TONAN UNIVERSITY

84
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,267
-Stairs.
-Watch your step.

85
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:54,467
You are in my way.
To be honest, this is very annoying.

86
00:09:55,467 --> 00:10:00,200
This is for you.
I am protecting you from Irie.

87
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,267
What?! Irie?

88
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:08,633
I will be fine.
He doesn't like me at all.

89
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,233
He told me unequivocally
not to talk to him at school.

90
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
Clear.

91
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,267
-Roger.
-Look.

92
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:25,133
Is that the girl who lives at your place?
What are they doing?

93
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,967
I don't care.

94
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,600
Spy on Irie's house?

95
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,567
You are nuts, Kin-chan.

96
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:46,567
But you two are also curious about them,
aren't you?

97
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,500
Well, I guess.

98
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,567
That's the house.

99
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,533
Huge!

100
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,167
Walk stealthily. Walk stealthily.

101
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,833
If Irie finds us, he will be mad.

102
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,233
Here she is.

103
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,767
-Kotoko!
-Yes.

104
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:32,900
-Can't see anything.
-The cap is on.

105
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,100
Wow. Everything looks so delicious.

106
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:46,400
Very impressive, Ai-chan.

107
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,600
Wait. What is this?

108
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:56,800
It is deep-fried tofu I made.

109
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,767
It may not look good, but it is delicious.

110
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,600
-I don't want it.
-Me, either.

111
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:06,633
Naoki and Yuki, watch your mouth.

112
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,667
You two are rude.
Let's have a seat.

113
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,767
Damn you! You refused Kotoko's
homemade dish?

114
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,833
Calm down, Kin-chan.
They may see you.

115
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:30,200
Then I will eat Kotoko's dish.

116
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:34,433
If I eat it, you two can eat it, right?

117
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,667
This is terrible.

118
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,833
I knew it.

119
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,100
No, no. This is delicious.

120
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,967
Iri-chan, be honest. That's okay.

121
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:12,533
She has never been good at cooking.
I can't believe that she is my daughter.

122
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,600
I must wonder whether someone
will take her as his wife.

123
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:20,467
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

124
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,267
We like her. We will take her.

125
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,567
What did she just say?

126
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:39,533
I'm saying that you should marry Naoki.

127
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,333
No! I'm against it.

128
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,633
It's not your decision.

129
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
It's my life. Don't play with it.

130
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:54,867
Really? I really think that Kotoko
is your type.

131
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,067
Am I?

132
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,300
No way.

133
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,733
You are not my type at all.

134
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,533
I don't want to marry you, either.

135
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,233
Good. I'm glad that Kotoko said that.

136
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:17,500
Is that so? Then why did you give me such
a passionate message?

137
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
"How do you do, Irie?

138
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,900
I am Kotoko Aihara of Class F.

139
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:29,967
You may not know me, but I know you
well.

140
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:34,567
I have been in love with you, since--"

141
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,567
How dare you?

142
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,533
-What a jerk! Did you see my letter?
-You wrote it to me, didn't you?

143
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,567
-You don't need to memorize it.
-That's not my fault.

144
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,900
How dare you say it in front of everyone?

145
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,200
Wait. What's going on?

146
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:56,333
Kotoko, you mean you have been in love
with Naoki?

147
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,100
Did you hear that?

148
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,700
Tell it to everyone.

149
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,867
I wrote a love letter.

150
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,833
Is that true?

151
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,567
Then my fantasy

152
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,367
can be a reality.

153
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,633
But that was before
we started living together.

154
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,900
-Right now I'm not--
-Don't say that.

155
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,900
You may fall in love with him again.
What do you think, honey?

156
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,900
Well, if you two like each other,
I'm fine.

157
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,367
Hold it!

158
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,167
Open it!

159
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,900
Who are those kids?

160
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,300
Kin-chan?

161
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,467
Kotoko, open the door.

162
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:04,000
They are my classmates.

163
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,100
What the hell are you doing here?

164
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:15,467
Sorry, but Kin-chan really wants to know
how you are doing here.

165
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,533
Coming in?

166
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,000
Irie is a man, whether he is
a genius or not.

167
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:24,933
Who knows if he may get interested in
you in the future. See. I was right.

168
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,800
I will punish him for what he said.

169
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,667
-Who the hell are you?
-What?

170
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,333
Hello, everyone of Irie Family.
How do you do?

171
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,700
I am Kinnosuke Ikezawa aka Kin-chan.
I'm Kotoko's classmate.

172
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:44,500
It means that you are dumb, too.

173
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,667
-What did you say?
-Watch your mouth, Yuki.

174
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:53,133
Kotoko and I are in an intimate
relationship.

175
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,600
Kin-chan, stop your nonsense.

176
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:59,100
Kotoko, you are very popular
among boys, huh?

177
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,067
-That's right.
-I'm really sorry.

178
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:06,700
That's why I don't want you
to flirt with her.

179
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:11,967
Marriage? It's not funny at all.
Understand, Mr. Irie?

180
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,333
You never know.

181
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,233
What do you mean by that?

182
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,800
Our feelings are complicated.

183
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:25,600
I don't like her today,
but I may like her tomorrow.

184
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,833
What? After all, you like Kotoko,
don't you?

185
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,700
Who knows. But remember
that she likes me, not you.

186
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:41,933
I'm going to my room, so have fun.

187
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:47,100
<i>What was that?</i>
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

188
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,067
<i>Could it mean...</i>
<i>Do I have a hope?</i>

189
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,167
<i>Is that what he meant?</i>

190
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:06,133
<i>In the meantime, our last summer break</i>

191
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,467
<i>is about to begin.</i>

192
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,100
I wish I can make some wonderful
memories during the last summer break.

193
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,533
But we have to prepare
for the college entrance exam.

194
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,567
-I know that, but...
-I know what you mean.

195
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,600
All we do during the break
is our homework? It's sad.

196
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,400
Kotoko, you are a lucky one.
You can be with him all summer long.

197
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,033
Nothing will happen.

198
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,667
Who knows.
He was so passionate the other day.

199
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,933
He was just carried away by the argument.

200
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,967
You may be right. He didn't even
touch the dish you cooked.

201
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:52,400
That's because I'm not good at cooking.

202
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,300
You are missing the point.

203
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:00,967
Men can't resist a dish
cooked by women they love.

204
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,200
It doesn't matter how terrible it is.

205
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,367
That's right. You live with him.

206
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,067
You can find a way to make him
appreciate your cooking.

207
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,033
That could be

208
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,133
the best memory of your summer.

209
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,533
My homemade dish, huh?

210
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,100
I'm so worried.

211
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:29,467
But I can't spy on their house every day.
On the other hand, Irie

212
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,200
can be with Kotoko during the break.

213
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,900
It's true that women tend to fall in love
with someone close.

214
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:40,000
Shut up! You are not helping.

215
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,333
Bro, don't give up.

216
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,567
You should stay close to Kotoko
as much as possible.

217
00:19:55,767 --> 00:20:01,467
FIRST DAY OF SUMMER BREAK

218
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,433
Good morning, everyone.

219
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,700
Good morning.

220
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,067
Kotoko, you don't have school anymore,
do you?

221
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,567
Well, for some reason,

222
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:29,967
I have to go to school.

223
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:33,133
Why? This is summer break.

224
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,433
Well, because... What can I say...

225
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,267
-Yuki, answer the door, please.
-Okay.

226
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,667
Yes?

227
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,533
<i>Hi, Irie Family!</i>
<i>Good morning.</i>

228
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,900
<i>I'm here to pick up Kotoko</i>
<i>for mandatory summer school.</i>

229
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,400
Mandatory summer school?

230
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,667
But you ranked 100th
in the last exam.

231
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:10,633
That was the term-end exam.

232
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,233
I didn't do well with the mid-term.

233
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:22,333
I wonder how bad your grade was
before the term-end exam. You are dumb.

234
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Shut up.

235
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,233
See you later.

236
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,467
All the students from Class F are here.

237
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:40,333
This looks like a regular class.

238
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,967
Listen up. Let me be clear.
You all are on the borderline

239
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:49,967
between going on to
Tonan University or not.

240
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:55,233
Including Aihara, who ranked 100th in the
term-end exam.

241
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,600
That's why I want you to work hard
in summer school.

242
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,567
So-called "summer school of hell"
starts now.

243
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,300
Keep in mind that this summer
is a crucial time.

244
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:16,200
Now we have to forget about making
good memories of summer.

245
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:20,733
Our memory of the last summer in the
high school will be homework only.

246
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,667
This is exactly what Kotoko predicted.

247
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,300
C'mon. This is not that bad.

248
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:29,933
You can spend the entire summer
with Kin-chan.

249
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,867
That will be a great memory of summer.
Eat it.

250
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,900
Kin-chan, sense the mood.

251
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,367
You are not the one whom Kotoko
wants to spend the summer with.

252
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:44,333
But she can't spend time with Irie,
because of summer school.

253
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,867
Wait. But I saw Irie today.

254
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,033
Don't say that, idiot.

255
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,600
What? Irie? Why? No way.

256
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,300
Is Irie taking summer class?

257
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:58,400
No. Look outside.

258
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Right. Irie is a de facto member
of the tennis team.

259
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,467
De facto? What do you mean?

260
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:17,267
He is asked to play for the team
only in an important tournament.

261
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,067
I see.

262
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:25,033
Right. The national high school tennis
tournament is coming up soon.

263
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,567
What?!

264
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,500
I thought he was super smart,
but not athletic.

265
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,067
It's not fair.

266
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:35,900
He is a perfect guy
except his personality.

267
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,733
He makes me sick.

268
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:44,267
He didn't tell me
that he was coming to school today.

269
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,567
He still has no interest in you.

270
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,067
That's good.

271
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:08,300
Our feelings are complicated. I don't like
her today, but I may like her tomorrow.

272
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,700
Lost in your thought,
while staring at him?

273
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,567
What? Not at all.

274
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:21,133
No weight training, no running.
But can he still win a game?

275
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,000
That's not what a good team player
should be.

276
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:29,500
Let's get back to work.
Let's study hard.

277
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:34,000
Mars, the red planet,
has fascinated people

278
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:37,167
from the earliest time.

279
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:43,467
Ancient people identified
it with the god of war...

280
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:47,300
Understand? First of all...

281
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:51,500
<i>He is so cool,</i>
<i>whether he is a jerk or not.</i>

282
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,733
<i>He will get tired after the practice.</i>

283
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,667
<i>If I cook something special for him,</i>

284
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,633
<i>it may make him feel better.</i>

285
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,300
<i>That could be a good idea.</i>

286
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,667
Aihara.

287
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,033
-Kotoko Aihara!
-Kotoko.

288
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,067
-Yes.
-Read the next paragraph.

289
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:22,467
What?

290
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:28,600
-Run 10 laps for punishment.
-10 laps?

291
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,833
Run faster.

292
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,333
One more lap, Aihara.

293
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:28,467
Sorry about that. Not on purpose.

294
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:32,167
Isn't summer class over yet?

295
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,933
None of your business.
I just wanted to run.

296
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,267
Aihara! No time for a lover's quarrel.

297
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,933
Here you go. Did you get sunburn?

298
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,833
You have a PE class, too?

299
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,567
-Well, this is...
-Kotoko didn't listen to the lecture.

300
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:05,100
So she was forced
to run round the schoolyard.

301
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:07,700
How do you know that?

302
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,133
Set a thief to catch a thief.

303
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,200
Thief? What do you mean?

304
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,333
You don't even know the phrase?
What a shame!

305
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,833
Yuki, stop teasing her.

306
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,033
It's summer. It's not bad to get sunburn.

307
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,667
You are right.

308
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:30,167
We usually go vacationing in the mountains
or beaches during the summer.

309
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,567
-But not this summer. Too bad.
-What?

310
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,867
Didn't Ai-chan tell you that?

311
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,200
What happens is,

312
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:44,800
we are going to Kyushu to attend
our middle-school reunion.

313
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:49,333
-Is that so?
-So no family vacation, right?

314
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,900
Why don't you go to Kyushu
with your husband?

315
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:56,900
I can't leave you guys here.

316
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:59,267
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you for the meal.

317
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,267
Thank you for the meal.

318
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,467
I will help you.

319
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,567
Thank you, Kotoko. Can you wash dishes?

320
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,267
-Sure.
-In the meantime,

321
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:28,433
I will prepare your box-lunch
for tomorrow.

322
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,367
I really appreciate your kindness.

323
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:33,800
Since you leave early,
I must prepare it at night.

324
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,000
Mrs. Irie.

325
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,433
Can you teach me how to cook someday?

326
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,900
I can, but you have a father
who is a professional chef.

327
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:59,600
That's true, but I want to master

328
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,700
a taste of mom's home cooking.

329
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:06,000
You want to learn recipes
of the Irie Family, don't you?

330
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:14,700
Tell me. You are still in love
with my son, aren't you?

331
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:22,033
-How do you know?
-I can tell it.

332
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,833
I really want you to marry him.
So you can be my daughter.

333
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,567
I won't make a good match for him.

334
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,467
When I got married,

335
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:41,167
I was 19 years old.

336
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:46,033
I'm not bragging,
but I had a plenty of suitors.

337
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,500
All of them were rich and handsome.

338
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,367
Among them, he is not handsome as you
can see. And he is much older.

339
00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:00,100
Back then, he just started his business
and was poor.

340
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,600
My parents were against

341
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,833
my going out with him.

342
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:11,867
But you chose him. Tell me why.

343
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,633
He is the most sincere person I ever met.

344
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:20,367
And a more serious person
than anybody else.

345
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,567
On top of that, he really cares about me.

346
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,500
He didn't care about the social standing
of my family or my look.

347
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:34,033
He really loves who I am.

348
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:42,733
Kotoko, you remind me of him.

349
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,000
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

350
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,667
Congratulations!

351
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:03,500
Let's make a toast to Naoki winning
the national high school tournament.

352
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:07,133
Cheers!

353
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,733
Have a seat and eat.

354
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,000
Naoki, you are very impressive.

355
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,800
You are not only smart,
but also good at tennis.

356
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:26,133
Besides, you have won the title
three straight years, right?

357
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,300
You are juggling so many things.
Very impressive.

358
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:36,033
It's easy. If you study the opponent
and calculate his move,

359
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
you can tell where the ball is heading.

360
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:42,600
See. He is not a lovable type.

361
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,867
He is very smart. That's all.

362
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:48,967
He takes after Iri-chan in that, even
though they don't look like each other.

363
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:56,167
I wasn't that smart when
we were in the middle school.

364
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,633
-Really?
-I wasn't that smart.

365
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:02,633
-It was the good old days.
-Yes.

366
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,167
I'm looking forward
to the reunion tomorrow.

367
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,433
This is the first time I go back to Kyushu
for a long time.

368
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,533
I imagine that everyone has changed.

369
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,200
I wonder if Hiromasa
will come to the reunion.

370
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,033
THE LAST DAY OF SUMMER BREAK

371
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,933
See you soon.

372
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,400
-Have a great trip.
-Bye.

373
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,567
-The red shirt suits you well.
-Don't make me self-conscious.

374
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,400
Have a safe trip.

375
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,867
They are like kids who go on a picnic.

376
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:34,433
Since my dad has been busy,
he can't go back to Kyushu often.

377
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,467
I'm sure that he is very excited.

378
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:45,700
Hello, this is Irie residence.
What? Really?

379
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:50,567
I will be right there.

380
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:53,667
-Oh, my goodness. What should I do?
-What happened?

381
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,700
Your grandma got hurt.

382
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,733
It's not serious, but she must stay
in the hospital tonight.

383
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,867
So I must stay with her
at the hospital tonight.

384
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,800
-Do whatever you need.
-Thank you.

385
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,467
You two take charge
of the house today. Okay?

386
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,833
Sure. What? Two of us?

387
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,733
I will take Yuki. You two
have school tomorrow. That's why.

388
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,067
Understood. I'm fine with that.

389
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,367
Get ready quickly.

390
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,600
<i>It means that Irie and I</i>

391
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,300
<i>are alone in this house.</i>

392
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:40,700
<i>It makes me very nervous,</i>
<i>but this could be a great opportunity.</i>

393
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,900
-Let's go, Yuki.
-Okay.

394
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:59,900
<i>This is it! Finally I can cook for Irie.</i>

395
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,867
This will be the best memory of this
summer.

396
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,833
"Bifteck en...

397
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,300
Bour...geoise."

398
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,667
This is it.

399
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,533
What the hell is this?

400
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Hi, Irie...

401
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:07,667
What is that?

402
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,333
Bifteck en Bourgeoise.

403
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,467
Oh, no...

404
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,400
Don't you need to check the recipe?

405
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:43,300
I already did. I've memorized it.

406
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,600
It smells nice.

407
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:24,467
And how is grandma doing?
Aren't we going to see her?

408
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:28,967
It's a long story, Yuki.

409
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,033
They don't know
how to deal with each other.

410
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,267
I want to make them get closer.
Since their fathers are out,

411
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,567
I want them to have an intimate moment.

412
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:45,167
But you said that grandma got hurt.

413
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,567
Of course, I made it up.
It was a sales call.

414
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,933
My acting was very convincing, wasn't it?

415
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,833
What? I'm going home.

416
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,767
I see. Then you don't want this?

417
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:28,167
Wow. This is exactly like the photo
of the cooking book.

418
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,133
Bon appetite.

419
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:33,367
Bon appetite.

420
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,933
<i>Contrary to my plan,</i>

421
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,700
<i>we ended up</i>
<i>eating Irie's homemade dish.</i>

422
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:04,333
<i>But I'm having a wonderful dinner</i>
<i>with Irie.</i>

423
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,633
<i>We are like a newly-wed couple.</i>

424
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,133
I'm sorry that you had to cook.

425
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:23,233
Then I want extremely sweet dessert
from you.

426
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,400
Hey.

427
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,933
You should wash the dishes at least.

428
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,467
And clean up the kitchen.

429
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:05,667
Okay. You do your homework now?
Can we do that together?

430
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:10,533
Homework? I finished it all
on the first day of summer break.

431
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,367
On the first day? Wow.

432
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,900
Don't tell me that you
haven't touched it yet.

433
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,567
Well, you are right about that.

434
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:25,833
It would take you a week to finish it
even if you work day and night.

435
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Good luck.

436
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,033
Oh, no, what should I do?
It's already 10 o'clock.

437
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,233
It took so long to clean up the kitchen.

438
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,233
Let's do it.

439
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,267
I don't understand it at all.

440
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,933
Let's take a look at English.
It should be easy.

441
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,200
I have to study until the end.
What a terrible summer break it is!

442
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:44,133
I managed to fill something in questions
of Classics, World history and English.

443
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:50,467
But I still have Mathematics and
Physics. I can't take it anymore.

444
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,567
<i>I'm sorry, God and Buddha.</i>

445
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,833
<i>I feel like a criminal</i>

446
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,033
<i>who is cornered by the police.</i>

447
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,933
<i>Let me see...</i>

448
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:27,067
<i>your answers.</i>

449
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:42,000
Safe.

450
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:55,067
Where is Irie's notebook?

451
00:42:55,233 --> 00:43:00,533
Where is it?
Here you go.

452
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,700
Mathematics and Physics.
I will borrow these.

453
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,133
What the hell are you doing? Sneaking
into someone's room during the night?

454
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,033
Nothing. I have to go. Good night.

455
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,300
Don't you wish!

456
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:36,967
These are...

457
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:38,733
I know what you are doing.

458
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:46,167
-You want to come into my bed, don't you?
-Stop. What are you doing?

459
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:52,667
You sneak into a boy's room. What
else do you expect?

460
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,200
Relax. I won't let you down.

461
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:02,233
Won't let me down? You mean...

462
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,900
We are the only ones at home tonight.

463
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:09,400
-But...
-Your friends were right.

464
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:13,300
Even a genius may turn into a beast.

465
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,667
No, stop it.

466
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:20,900
I like you.

467
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:24,667
But we are not ready for this.

468
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,600
We should have
a platonic relationship first.

469
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,033
Platonic relationship? Really?

470
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,000
I see. It means that you still love me.

471
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,333
You weren't serious?

472
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:54,633
Relax. I am not interested in you at all.

473
00:44:57,033 --> 00:45:02,533
I will tell everyone that Irie
tried to assault me.

474
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,400
Go ahead.

475
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:12,267
Everyone has already been gossiping
about us. It won't change anything.

476
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,200
-You win.
-Hey.

477
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:20,867
You forgot something.

478
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,100
I don't need...

479
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,900
The same formula applies
to number three. Try it.

480
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,700
Can I just copy your answers?

481
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:56,333
It wouldn't help you at all. Just do it.

482
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,300
<i>After all, my memory of the summer</i>
<i>is doing my homework.</i>

483
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:13,533
<i>I didn't get what I hoped for.</i>

484
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:20,867
<i>But I am so happy now.</i>

485
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:23,200
<i>I wonder why.</i>

486
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:30,100
-Focus. Do it now.
-Okay.

487
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:46,700
Well, this one is...

488
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,333
We ended up staying up all night.

489
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:05,633
To show you my gratitude,
I will make breakfast for you.

490
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,567
No, thanks. I don't want to have a
stomachache on the first day of school.

491
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,300
-Coffee.
-What did you say?

492
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:24,000
Make coffee for me.

493
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:31,767
Okay.

494
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,633
Here you go.

495
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,967
Good morning, Irie.

496
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:19,300
We were up all night together.

497
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:39,267
<i>I couldn't make special memories</i>

498
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:42,633
<i>during the last summer break</i>
<i>of high school.</i>

499
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:47,667
<i>But I will never forget the aroma</i>
<i>of this morning coffee</i>

500
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,733
<i>which I shared with Irie.</i>

501
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,100
The written oracle said that I would have
the best of luck.

502
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,300
NEXT EPISODE

503
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:29,233
Of course, Naoki Irie's dream school is
Tokyo University, right?

504
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,467
Why do you want to go to a college?

505
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:33,033
You are taking the standardized college
admission test, right?

506
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,767
I will accompany Irie to the gate of Tokyo
University.

507
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,800
-Oh, no, I slipped.
-Don't tell me this medicine is...

508
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:41,133
Naoki, throw it up.

509
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,400
Don't tell it to Kotoko, no matter what.

510
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:44,633
What happened, son?

511
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,600
I didn't get the name.

512
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,967
I think you will stick to her forever.

513
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:51,700
{\an8}It was the most nerve-racking moment
in my life.

514
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:52,933
{\an8}Good-bye, Irie.

515
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,467
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
