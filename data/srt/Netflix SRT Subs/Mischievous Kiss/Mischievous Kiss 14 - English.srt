1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,300
-How's my father's condition?
-If he keeps on overworking,

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,100
-he might have a heart attack.
-I'll do it.

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,700
I'll protect Dad's company.

4
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:14,067
If Irie feels helpless

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,400
and needs assistance,
I'll do whatever I can,

6
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:21,167
-if there's anything I can do.
-If it stays this way, Pandai might

7
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:24,533
be merged into them. Right now,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,433
we need huge
financial assistance.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,067
This is Chairman Oizumi and his
secretary, Yokoyama from Hokueisha.

10
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,867
About finance, I'll be discussing
with you,

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,400
instead of my father.

12
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:38,100
Dad's condition is not that great.

13
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,167
If I take over the company...

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,100
everything will work out.

15
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,800
What an honor for us to receive
a visit

16
00:00:56,867 --> 00:01:00,567
-from you. Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

17
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,100
I had some business to take care of
in this area also.

18
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,633
Are you alone today?

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,800
I wanted talk to you
in person today.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,867
To me?

21
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,700
Naoki, would you like to have an
arranged marriage meeting?

22
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:29,700
I'm hesitant to ask you while
Mr. Irie is hospitalized,

23
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,900
but I have a granddaughter.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,533
She's the same age as you and goes
to University of the Sacred heart.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,833
That's the most prestigious school.

26
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:45,800
What do you think, Naoki?
How about seeing her once?

27
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,533
You're young. I know you can't
give me an answer right away.

28
00:01:55,467 --> 00:02:00,133
Discuss with your parents and
give me an answer in a few days.

29
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,567
We'll discuss about the investment
after that.

30
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,867
-Sorry for the surprise visit.
-No problem at all.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,767
Then Naoki, think about it
really well.

32
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,667
Yes. Thank you.

33
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,033
Naoki.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,500
This will be a good deal...

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,867
for the company also, right?

36
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:48,900
-What do you mean, Naoki?
-Honey, calm down.

37
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,067
However...

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,900
having a marriage meeting with

39
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:57,633
the granddaughter of Chairman Oizumi?
What's going on?

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,633
Nothing.

41
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:06,367
Could it be that it's for
the financial assistance?

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,267
Since we came here without
telling them,

43
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,333
-will Dad be surprised?
-What do we do?

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,667
-Will it be bad for his heart?
-What are you talking about?

45
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,500
He'll get so much better to get rid
of the disease when he sees you.

46
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,833
Don't underestimate
your parents.

47
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,533
I...

48
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:35,200
never wanted to sacrifice you...

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,100
to save the company.

50
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,767
He's right. Marrying her is
out of the question.

51
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,533
Marrying? My brother is?

52
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm proud of myself to make Pandai
big in one generation.

53
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,567
So, don't be so considerate
for me.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,467
Marry a person you really love.

55
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:05,933
I like her.

56
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:14,133
When I saw her picture,
she was my type.

57
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,300
Brother.

58
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,933
-Are you serious?
-Yuki.

59
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,367
Are you really marrying her?
Because....

60
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,633
Kotoko! Mr. Aihara too.

61
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,233
Irie.

62
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,500
Is it true that you're having
a marriage meeting?

63
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,700
Yeah.

64
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,000
This Sunday.

65
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,533
Since my dad is like this,

66
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:57,467
it's not a formal one,
but we're having lunch together.

67
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,133
I want you to come, Mom.

68
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,100
Be ready for it.

69
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:25,767
<i>It can't be.</i>

70
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,833
<i>Irie is having an arranged</i>
<i>marriage meeting.</i>

71
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,133
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,067
<i>What can I do?</i>

73
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:40,067
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

74
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,700
Is Irie having a marriage meeting?

75
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,000
{\an8}With the granddaughter of his
business connection.

76
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,367
{\an8}CROSSROADS OF LOVE

77
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:55,000
{\an8}-It's a political marriage, isn't it?
-Does that still happen these days?

78
00:07:55,067 --> 00:08:00,400
I don't know.
Irie said he liked the girl.

79
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,200
Sorry, I gotta go.

80
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,400
Is Kotoko okay?

81
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,533
She's not okay. How many years

82
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,333
do you think she's been
in one-sided love with Irie?

83
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Right. But I can't
believe that Irie is

84
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,667
-having a marriage meeting.
-I won't forgive Irie.

85
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:28,433
You're right. How much does Irie
have to trifle with Kotoko?

86
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,867
It's more like Kotoko is being
trifled by herself.

87
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,700
But how about Kotoko's feelings?
She's been...

88
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,367
devoting herself to Irie, but...

89
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,467
he's having a marriage
meeting with someone else?

90
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:43,767
Kin-chan?

91
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:49,900
It sounds like you want Kotoko
and Irie to be together.

92
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,400
I didn't say that.

93
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,100
I just want Kotoko to...

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,233
be smiling. That's all.

95
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,867
<i>If I take over the company...</i>

96
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,167
everything will work out.

97
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,300
But you have a dream to become
a doctor, don't you?

98
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,667
I had that dream only a short
time ago.

99
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,900
Are you giving up?

100
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,333
Irie.

101
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,367
<i>That time...</i>

102
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:10,867
<i>I thought we were together</i>
<i>at heart.</i>

103
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:21,800
I broke it.

104
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,000
Are you okay, Kotoko?

105
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,900
Oh, no! You're bleeding.

106
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,800
It looks painful.

107
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,867
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

108
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,500
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

109
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,233
It must've been because of
Naoki's marriage meeting.

110
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,867
That Naoki.

111
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,467
His bride should be...

112
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,300
you. I'm not changing my mind.

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,367
This is what Irie has decided.

114
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,833
About that, I can't believe that

115
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,833
what he said was
his real intention.

116
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,167
It's the same thing
with the company deal.

117
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,467
Of course I've been

118
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,200
thinking that It would be great
for Naoki

119
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,500
to take over Pandai.

120
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:15,767
But looking at Naoki work there

121
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,900
makes me think that
something is not right.

122
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:24,033
I don't feel like it's what Naoki
really wants to do.

123
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,700
I think Naoki feels responsible

124
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,967
for his dad becoming sick.

125
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:37,033
That's why he's sacrificing himself
to save the company.

126
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,267
But would he marry for that reason?
It's once in a lifetime thing.

127
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,667
He's the kind of a boy who's determined
once he makes up his mind.

128
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:51,700
Therefore, I...

129
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:59,000
-thought of a good idea.
-Good idea?

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,967
Irie is having a marriage meeting,
isn't he?

131
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,067
She's the granddaughter of
the chairman of Hokueisha.

132
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,467
-Chairman Oizumi's?
-Do you know him?

133
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:34,300
Of course. Don't you read
newspapers?

134
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:38,367
He's a bigwig in the business world.

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
He influences politicians.

136
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,967
He's the big boss of
Japanese business.

137
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,300
I never knew that she was the
granddaughter of such great person.

138
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:52,233
I heard that she's been going to
Sacred Heart since kindergarten.

139
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,000
She's real high-class.

140
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,733
Irie said that he liked her right
away when he saw her picture.

141
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,933
She must be beautiful.

142
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,733
I don't like it.

143
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:16,000
Think about it. Why is Irie being
taken away by this new perfect girl?

144
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,067
-I don't get it.
-Well...

145
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,133
I think Mrs. Irie will do
something about it.

146
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,500
What? Mrs. Irie?
What do you mean?

147
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,533
Oh, who? Me?

148
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:35,500
-No, nothing.
-There must be something. Tell me.

149
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:41,500
So, it's a secret. The operation for
Mrs. Irie to ruin the meeting.

150
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,933
Ruining the meeting, huh?

151
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:55,133
-You guys haven't improved at all.
-So what?

152
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,533
However...

153
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,967
I'll join you this time.

154
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:17,000
THE DAY OF THE MARRIAGE MEETING

155
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,700
This way, please.

156
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,567
Oh, Naoki and Mrs. Irie.

157
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:35,433
-I've been waiting for you.
-Thank you for waiting.

158
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,967
Sorry that we're having this while
Mr. Irie is at hospital.

159
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:46,500
It's just me and my granddaughter,
Sahoko today.

160
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
The formal meeting with Sahoko's
parents will be

161
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:55,400
after Mr. Irie gets better.
We'll set it up another day.

162
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,600
I wonder if that day would come.

163
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:02,867
Mom.

164
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:07,900
One, two.
One. two.

165
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,533
Why do I have to dress like this?

166
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,600
Don't complain. In order to sneak
into the garden

167
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,000
...without being suspicious,
this was the only way.

168
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,533
That way.

169
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,733
What kind of a girl is Chairman
Oizumi's granddaughter?

170
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,633
-She doesn't seem to be there, yet.
-Really?

171
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:45,533
Sahoko is getting ready now.
She'll be here soon.

172
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,500
-I'm sorry, I'm late.
-Sahoko. We've been waiting for you.

173
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:05,167
You're the person...

174
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:13,600
Are you okay?

175
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,667
Do you remember me?

176
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,600
I don't forget a beautiful
lady like you.

177
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:26,167
Wow, it wasn't the first time
for you to see each other.

178
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:30,067
That makes it easy. Here, Sahoko,
Have a seat.

179
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:49,600
Hey, What are you doing?
Stay alert. Give me that.

180
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:05,067
So what? Even if she's kind of
pretty, she may not be smart.

181
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,967
Right. Let's go closer and
listen to their conversation.

182
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:20,467
-Crawl forward! Let's go.
-Are we really doing that?

183
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,767
I can't do it.

184
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:49,667
-What's your hobby?
-I'm not good at anything.

185
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,867
Cooking, sewing, and crafting.

186
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,833
-I'm boring.
-Oh, you're right.

187
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,967
Boring.

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,767
-Mrs. Irie, good job.
-Hush! They'll hear us.

189
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,000
It might sound strange for me
to say it as her grandfather...

190
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,800
but she's very graceful.
She's like...

191
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,933
an ideal Japanese woman
in this modern days.

192
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,667
That's great. I like a lady
who's graceful.

193
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:28,233
Oh, my! Ideal Japanese woman?

194
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,133
So old-fashioned.

195
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,200
No wonder you don't have much
youthfulness.

196
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:52,100
Well, what are your interests,
Naoki?

197
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,633
Well, I read often.

198
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,700
-Also I play tennis a little.
-What do you mean by little?

199
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,300
I heard that you won
many competitions.

200
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,967
-Wow, wonderful.
-I'll teach you next time.

201
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:12,367
-What?
-I'm happy to hear.

202
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:16,500
But I'm bad at it so you might
get tired of me.

203
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,767
-I think he will.
-Mom.

204
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:25,400
Actually, Naoki is very mean.

205
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,433
He looks down on the person who
can't do it after he teaches once.

206
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,600
He shows it outright too.

207
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:41,267
Oh, good job, Mrs. Irie.

208
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,000
I think she's the one who's
being outright.

209
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,333
You're good at academics and sports.

210
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,267
You're good-looking too.
Naoki, you must be popular.

211
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,200
-Not so much.
-Yes, he's very popular.

212
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Don't worry.
He's never dated a girl.

213
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:09,033
-You're conservative.
-Yes. He's very conservative.

214
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,933
He refuses to accept the love letter
right in front of the girl.

215
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,033
Even if a girl confesses her love to
him he refuses in front of everyone.

216
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,133
He's really conservative.

217
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,700
Is that story all about you?

218
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,733
You're really being hated,
aren't you?

219
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:38,800
But compared to a man who makes
himself available to everybody...

220
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:43,567
it's much better to be cold.

221
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,833
Exactly. You don't have to worry
about him cheating on you.

222
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:57,267
It wasn't like he didn't know
any women.

223
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,267
To be honest, Naoki has lived...

224
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,700
with this girl...

225
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,900
...who's his age for nearly
three years.

226
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:08,100
Give me a break. She's not staying
with me, but with our family.

227
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,067
-It's the same thing.
-Mr. Oizumi, there's a reason.

228
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:15,767
Right. We might accept your

229
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:20,600
precious granddaughter.
She has to know our situation.

230
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:25,833
We have a girl who lives under
the same roof.

231
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,733
It's an unmistakable fact.

232
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,467
Even if he's conservative,
he's a young man.

233
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:36,067
I can't guarantee that

234
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:41,233
-...nothing has happened.
-Sahoko.

235
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,767
Shall we go to the garden?

236
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:47,133
-Oh, good idea.
-Just Sahoko and I.

237
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,933
Sorry that we didn't notice.
You both go together.

238
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,567
-Let's go.
-Yes.

239
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,333
Oh, my back.

240
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:05,733
I'm sorry. My mom was being
rude to you.

241
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,833
No. Your mom must like...

242
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,633
that person.

243
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,700
The girl who lives
with your family.

244
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:23,933
She's the daughter of my dad's
best friend. We're family friends.

245
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,000
That's why my mom said
things like that.

246
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,467
But the person who likes her is...

247
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,400
not me, but my mom.

248
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,167
I want your mom to like me.

249
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:49,400
Before all that I have to be liked
by you.

250
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:55,600
Does that mean that you
like me?

251
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:04,433
Ever since I first met you
in front of the elevator.

252
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,233
What a coincidence.
It's the same with me.

253
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
Wow.

254
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,467
How irritating! What's that mood?

255
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,700
-You, how about the first operation?
-All right.

256
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,767
We'll move from here.

257
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:41,333
The secret weapon of our first
operation is this sprinkler.

258
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,900
We'll turn it on when they
pass by here.

259
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:49,733
Her kimono will be soaking wet.
She just has to go home.

260
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,033
-Isn't it too easy?
-It's better to be simple. Let's go.

261
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:59,833
There are Bonsais that are more
than 500 years old.

262
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,333
-That old?
-Ready?

263
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:07,400
-Right now.
-Yes.

264
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,000
It's nice weather, isn't it?
I feel like playing in water.

265
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,033
Why?

266
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,233
I'm glad to know that you have
that kind of personality.

267
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,800
Hey, what are you doing?
You're so slow.

268
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:29,100
They've passed it already.
Give me that.

269
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,167
Why? That's odd.

270
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:34,400
-It can't be.
-What's going on?

271
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:37,400
This switch doesn't work at all.

272
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,567
What?

273
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,767
A sprinkler must be malfunctioning.
Let's go.

274
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:52,900
Yes.

275
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,933
Stop it.

276
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,467
No!

277
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,267
Why do I have to go through this?

278
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,433
Stupid.

279
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:16,333
We pull ourselves together and go
with the second operation. Let's go.

280
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,900
My eyes. Ouch.

281
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:27,633
Your tricks are really like
elementary school.

282
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,233
-But they're gross, aren't they?
-They are.

283
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,533
Let me show you.

284
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,233
When that Sahoko girl passes through
there, I throw this at her.

285
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,633
She'll scream and fall into
the pond.

286
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,000
It serves her right.

287
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:51,533
-Am I doing too much?
-Give me a break.

288
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,833
You're too soft as always. That's
why Irie doesn't care about you.

289
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,767
-I can't argue with that.
-I'm the same way, though.

290
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:08,033
Look, there they are. Hurry.

291
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,167
Hurry, they'll pass by again.

292
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,300
-I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
-Hurry!

293
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
We did it!

294
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,433
You're okay since I'm with you.

295
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:43,633
Oh, did someone fall into the pond?

296
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,200
It looks like they're custodians.

297
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,967
They must be cleaning the pond.

298
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,033
Let's go.

299
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,833
What a water disaster you had,
Kotoko.

300
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,667
I got a punishment

301
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:12,533
since I tried to be mean to such
a beautiful girl.

302
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Sahoko, huh?

303
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,567
She surely was kind of beautiful.

304
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,367
Mrs. Irie, when did you...?

305
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:26,667
But she's not his type at all.

306
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,433
Naoki needs excitements
in his life.

307
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,533
With a perfect and
quiet girl like her,

308
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,100
he'll soon feel like something is missing.

309
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,500
I can see that clearly.

310
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,867
But they seemed to be...

311
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,867
interested in each other
very much.

312
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:52,433
Besides, my evil-mother-in-law
tactics worked well too.

313
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:58,133
Chairman Oizumi must be
furious by now.

314
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,400
To the family that has this kind of
mother-in-law, he won't send

315
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:06,000
his precious granddaughter.
They'll decline it for sure.

316
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,767
Here it comes. It's the sound of
the phone

317
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:17,167
to tell us their refusal.
I'm coming.

318
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,200
Hello, this is Irie.

319
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,000
Chairman Oizumi.

320
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,333
I'm sorry for my mom's behavior
today.

321
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:41,067
Is that right? It's okay with me.

322
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,800
Please take care of it.

323
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,767
How was it? Did he decline?

324
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,500
Sahoko likes me...

325
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,033
-he wants to go forward with it.
-What?

326
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,067
So, I asked him to go forward
with it.

327
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,733
-Naoki.
-She's the person who I like.

328
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,500
So, don't get in a way of us
like that anymore, Mom.

329
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,900
-You too.
-What?

330
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,133
-What?
-It was so obvious.

331
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,333
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:29,600
Naoki is serious about it?
I can't believe it.

333
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:54,867
Sahoko calls him often...

334
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:57,333
...and they go on dates many times
a week.

335
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:01,633
Mrs. Irie is irritated that Irie
comes home late.

336
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:08,900
-We can't do anything about it.
-Are you giving him up?

337
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Because I can't win against
Sahoko Oizumi.

338
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,333
But if Irie is taken away
from me...

339
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,533
it would've been better if
it was done by you.

340
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:32,400
Because if it's you, Irie will
regret it in the future.

341
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,800
He'd think that he should've
chosen Matsumoto.

342
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,300
I'm being made fun of, aren't I?

343
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:50,467
I feel like I lost without a battle
against Sahoko.

344
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,033
In that sense, I have to
acknowledge your effort.

345
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,600
Even though it's waste of your time,
you keep on going.

346
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,833
You makes me laugh.

347
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,500
Leave me alone.

348
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:15,133
I know. He kissed you, right?

349
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,067
That was just...

350
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,667
Good luck.

351
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:40,900
What was that?
Could that have been a cheer?

352
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,233
I'm back.

353
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:03,867
Yes.

354
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,567
I can do that.

355
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,167
See you tomorrow.
Yes.

356
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,300
I'm looking forward to it.

357
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,433
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

358
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,267
Do you have a date with Sahoko?
I'm just wondering.

359
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,867
Sorry. It's none of my business.

360
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,367
It's at Omotesando.

361
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,000
It's the party of this artist's
exhibition who he's a patron of.

362
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,700
Are you following me again?

363
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,900
Pretending to clean
the bathroom at the party venue.

364
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,767
Kin-chan.

365
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,367
How about that.
Looks good, huh?

366
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:10,333
-Eat this and cheer up.
-We told him

367
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
that Irie started dating the girl
he had a marriage meeting with.

368
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,733
You're right.

369
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,300
It means...

370
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,700
he's dating her.

371
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:30,367
Okay. Eat it.

372
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:34,233
-Here it is.
-I'm borrowing this.

373
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,567
Let me try some.

374
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:51,400
If you eat it with a frown,
my cuisine will taste bad.

375
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:55,433
Kotoko, cheer up.

376
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,467
You should feel better about a cold
guy like Irie to marry soon.

377
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:01,633
He's right.

378
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,167
I tell you.

379
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,400
I know that it's all in
my mind, but...

380
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,000
lately...

381
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:26,333
I was feeling like
I was closer to Irie.

382
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,367
So, I still...

383
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,167
can't accept the reality.

384
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,467
I know. I thought you two were

385
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,867
inseparable and would be
together.

386
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:01,000
Jinko, that's a cruel comment
for her now.

387
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:04,800
Irie is doing well with his marriage
meeting girl.

388
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,067
You are right.

389
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,300
It's a different circumstance
this time.

390
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,467
Because an arranged marriage is
between

391
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:19,400
families.
It's not like he can quit

392
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:21,767
when he gets tired of it.

393
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Irie knows it and is going forward
with it, I guess.

394
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:29,367
You're right.

395
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,367
-Let's eat.
-There. Eat it.

396
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:42,933
-Living is about eating, right?
-Cheer up. Eat a lot.

397
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,033
Sweets are especially good.

398
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:52,667
-All that artwork was amazing.
-Did you think so too?

399
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:56,433
The party was very nice and I felt
the artist's personality.

400
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,933
You must be hungry since it was
a standing party.

401
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:03,633
-Would you like dinner somewhere?
-I'd love to.

402
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,100
I know. There's an Italian
restaurant that my grandpa likes.

403
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:13,300
If it's Mr. Oizumi's favorite,
I can trust it. Let's go.

404
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,133
Naoki is late, isn't he?

405
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,133
I'll go take a look.

406
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,700
It's okay. It's dangerous for a girl
to go out this late at night.

407
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,767
But I don't feel like I can
go to sleep.

408
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:43,200
I'll go for a walk and get a juice
from a convenience store.

409
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,100
Kotoko-chan.

410
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:55,367
No matter what she says,
she still cares about Naoki.

411
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,067
Hey, good-looking.

412
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,533
Did you just have a date with that
high-class girl?

413
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,300
Wait, dude.

414
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,667
What are you thinking about Kotoko?

415
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,400
-It's none of your business.
-It is my business.

416
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:43,767
You've been suggestive to Kotoko,
haven't you?

417
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:48,033
Kotoko is a precious person
for me.

418
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,200
The feelings of my precious
person...

419
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,133
were being trifled with.
How can I keep myself quiet?

420
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,633
What are you going to do, then?

421
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:26,533
I'll take Kotoko away from you.

422
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,700
No, I'll protect her.

423
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:40,200
So, don't get in the way.

424
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,833
If you have a girl who wants to
marry you, you should know that.

425
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,200
If that girl is important to you...

426
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:53,767
Kotoko is important to me.

427
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:05,267
I can't watch Kotoko suffering
like that anymore.

428
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,733
What do you say?

429
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:32,367
<i>Irie, say, "Kotoko likes me."</i>

430
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:35,200
<i>You've said that before.</i>

431
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,400
<i>Please.</i>

432
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,733
Do as you like.

433
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:58,567
Yeah. I'll do as I like
just as you told me.

434
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:01,467
So, don't interrupt me
anymore.

435
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,733
It's a promise between men.

436
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,933
<i>Are we done for sure this time?</i>

437
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,833
<i>Giving up on Irie is...</i>

438
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,000
<i>impossible for me.</i>

439
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,767
Brother.

440
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:32,567
Are you really marrying that
girl from the marriage meeting?

441
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,533
-What do you want to know?
-Answer me.

442
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:43,233
I think that's what's
going to happen.

443
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,267
Do you really like that girl?

444
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,167
-What's the matter, Yuki?
-Give me your honest answer.

445
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,933
Because...
Because the girl you like is...

446
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,967
Kotoko, isn't it?

447
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:22,000
Because in that hospital room,
you...

448
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,533
-kissed Kotoko.
-I'll let you meet Sahoko soon.

449
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:31,000
She's beautiful and I heard that
she was a good cook.

450
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,033
I'm sure you'll like her.

451
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,300
She's suitable for me.

452
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:47,233
Everything will work out.

453
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:20,733
-Hey, good morning, Kotoko.
-Good morning, Kin-chan.

454
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:24,433
-Are you going to the cafeteria?
-Yeah.

455
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:29,167
Today's special is chicken katsu.
You like it, don't you?

456
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:33,133
I'll give you a big portion
secretly, so come.

457
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,833
Yeah. Thank you.

458
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:41,367
Hey, Kotoko.

459
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,033
This Sunday...

460
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:49,933
can we go out if you have time?

461
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,767
I got movie tickets from a customer
at Aihara.

462
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:59,467
So, I thought it might be
good for refreshment.

463
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:02,567
It's an action movie, so you
might feel refreshed.

464
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,833
-You can't go with me, I guess.
-I will.

465
00:46:13,067 --> 00:46:15,367
I will. Let's go together.

466
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:22,267
I mean... It's going to be a date.

467
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:25,000
-Are you sure?
-With Mr. Irie's issues,

468
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:27,867
you've been helping me.

469
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,200
Let's go on a date to
thank you for it also.

470
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:38,700
See you later, then.

471
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:06,633
I heard the president would be
discharged next week.

472
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:09,700
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

473
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:14,400
Also about the arranged marriage
meeting...

474
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:16,900
as soon as president becomes
stable,

475
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:20,100
you'll have dinner with both
sets of parents.

476
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:23,433
Then you go from there.
That's what they want to do.

477
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,133
That's okay with me.

478
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:29,867
Please take care of it.

479
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,867
Thank you, Naoki.

480
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,200
Chairman Oizumi will promise us
huge financial assistance.

481
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:42,200
Our company will be secure then.

482
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:12,233
<i>Irie and I are...</i>

483
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:20,800
<i>starting to go on a different</i>
<i>route from each other.</i>

484
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:30,267
<i>Beyond that...</i>

485
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:35,233
<i>what kind of future is waiting</i>
<i>for us?</i>

486
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,600
-Let's get married.
-What?

487
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,900
We're dating with marriage
in our minds.

488
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,133
I'm different from someone that I
don't mix up work and love.

489
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:30,200
-It depends on the person.
-It was fun. Time flew by.

490
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:34,633
-I'll decide my life by myself.
-I wanted to talk to you, Kotoko.

491
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,067
-We have to move out of Irie-chan's.
-You too, find a nice guy soon.

492
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:42,633
{\an8}<i>I decided that I would keep loving</i>
<i>Irie no matter how hard, but...</i>

493
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,500
