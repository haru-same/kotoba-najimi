1
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,033
The love letter that I wrote for
the first time in my life.

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:13,000
The love letter that would never
been read.

3
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,833
Terrible! Did you read my letter?

4
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,933
Kotoko, why don't you be Naoki's bride?

5
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,167
Marriage is out of question.

6
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,233
You don't know about people's minds.
Even if I don't like her today,

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,567
I might like her tomorrow.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,700
Wait, what are you doing? Wait!

9
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,400
Don't worry. I have no intention of
going out with you.

10
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,833
Did you make fun of me?

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,700
My memory of last summer vacation
in high school is nothing special.

12
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:51,333
But I'll never forget the aroma of
the coffee that I had with Irie.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,867
<i>Time flies by and the season</i>
<i>changed from summer to fall,</i>

14
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,967
<i>then fall to winter.</i>

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,467
<i>I made it to get promoted to college.</i>

16
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:16,600
<i>But the relationship between Irie and</i>
<i>I stays the same.</i>

17
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,733
<i>And nothing has progressed.</i>

18
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,300
So cute. You look good in kimono.

19
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:46,567
I choose navy blue this year.
It was yellow last year.

20
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,667
Jinko, Satomi!

21
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,767
-Wow!
-Happy new year.

22
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:54,200
Happy new year, Kotoko.

23
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,600
Wow, you're wearing a kimono this year.

24
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,367
Mrs. Irie helped me to get dressed.

25
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,200
Cute. You look good in it.

26
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,933
-Thank you.
-Jinko, did you put on some weight?

27
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,667
Stop it. I'm conscious of it.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,200
When I think about being free
from studying to enter college,

29
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,467
I get a big appetite for
Christmas cakes and

30
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,800
-the new year meal.
-I can relate to you.

31
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:20,967
Isn't it nice that all of us are
promoted to Tonan University?

32
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:24,033
Right.
We'll be college students in spring.

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,167
-Let's make this year a great one.
-Yes.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,533
-Shall we go now?
-Yes.

35
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,267
-There's a line there.
-It's amazing.

36
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,667
I wish I have a wonderful college life.

37
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:54,100
I wish I have a boyfriend this year.

38
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,467
Kotoko is serious, isn't she?

39
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,833
It's obvious that
what she's wishing, isn't it?

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,633
Hey, let's draw a fortune.

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,233
-This one.
-I'll take this one.

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,167
Which one should I pick? This one.

43
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,700
Great! I got the excellent luck.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,967
-Me too.
-Me three.

45
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,000
Three of us got the best one.

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
-Wait.
-What?

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,733
"The person who you've been waiting
for is coming. Look forward to it."

48
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:52,567
-Oh!
-You did it!

49
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,733
-What am I going to do?
-Let's see mine.

50
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,933
"The person is not coming, but you'll
hear from him." What does that mean?

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,433
-He's not coming again.
-"If you desire, he won't come."

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
Bro.

53
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:19,533
About this.

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,767
Don't you ever tell Kotoko.

55
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,700
-But--
-I'm telling you.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,733
I'm telling you not to.

57
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:32,867
Bro.

58
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,867
Congratulations!

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,367
To celebrate Kotoko's promotion
to university, cheers.

60
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,133
Cheers!

61
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,400
Congratulations.

62
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,967
Congratulations, Kotoko.

63
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,867
Let's eat, everyone.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,667
Thank you, everyone,
for doing this for me.

65
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:17,267
I thought Kotoko was still little, but now

66
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,667
she's going to be a college student
this spring.

67
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:23,933
Your mom in heaven must be
very happy for you.

68
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,667
-Dad.
-Sorry.

69
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:30,467
Naoki, you have to do well on the
entrance exam like Kotoko.

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,267
He's different from a fool like Kotoko.
He'll pass Tokyo University no problem.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,367
Yuki.

72
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,433
Oh, right.

73
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,533
Here, Irie, this is for you.

74
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:57,300
I was able to be promoted to college
because you helped me study.

75
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,400
It's just a small token of appreciation.

76
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,333
How wonderful. Why don't you open
it up and show us?

77
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,967
What's this?

78
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,600
It's a head massager.

79
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:30,167
Irie is taking an entrance exam for
Tokyo University.

80
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:34,267
So, I thought you had more to study.

81
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,667
It looks like a whisk. It's old man stuff.

82
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:42,400
-Hey, Yuki.
-Why don't you try it out, Naoki.

83
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,233
-Right.
-I'm okay.

84
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:49,167
Besides, let alone Tokyo University,
I haven't decided to go to college.

85
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:59,833
Yuki, why don't you show that to me?
How do you use it?

86
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,500
-On your head.
-On my head.

87
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:06,767
<i>No. Irie who's genius to get into</i>
<i>Tokyo University for sure may</i>

88
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,267
<i>not go to college?</i>

89
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:12,800
<i>What does he mean?</i>

90
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:18,000
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

91
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,233
{\an8}CHOCOLATE IS LOVE AMULET?!

92
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,767
{\an8}-Your mouth.
-What a big mouth!

93
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,700
{\an8}Aren't we in heaven for not having
to study in the third trimester?

94
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,967
-We sure are.
-Hey, look, look!

95
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,767
What a view!

96
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:39,700
We're having fun,
but class A is studying so hard.

97
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:44,267
-Isn't it strange?
-The Center Exam is getting close.

98
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,867
However, only Naoki Irie is relaxed.

99
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,067
I can't believe it. He's reading a
book that has nothing to do with

100
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,633
-the entrance exam leisurely.
-Hey.

101
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,700
Is Naoki Irie's first choice school
Tokyo University?

102
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,267
Let alone Tokyo University, I don't
know if I would go to college.

103
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,567
Kotoko. Kotoko?

104
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:16,367
I'm not sure.
I think he'll go if he passes.

105
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,967
What are you saying?
Irie will get in for sure.

106
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,067
Kotoko, you'll miss him when you
two go to different colleges.

107
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,767
But it's for Irie's future.

108
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,100
-I'll support him.
-I'll support him.

109
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,367
-Not quite, Jinko.
-Was I? Really?

110
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,967
-Mrs. Irie.
-Yes.

111
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,667
Can I possibly borrow your
sewing supplies?

112
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,967
Of course. Hold on a second.

113
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,600
Yes.

114
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,833
It got crooked.

115
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,233
You're okay. Do it slowly.

116
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,100
Is that lucky charm for Naoki?

117
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,533
Thank you, Kotoko.

118
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:27,700
The person who thinks about his
college exam the most is you, I think.

119
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:34,200
It's not true that
Irie's not going to college, is it?

120
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:41,267
I don't think he doesn't
want to go to college, but maybe

121
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,133
his dad's expectation is too high.

122
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:50,933
He graduated from Tokyo University,
so he wants Naoki to

123
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:57,400
go to the same college and
have him take over his business.

124
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,400
But being expected to do well might be

125
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,033
a burden on Naoki.

126
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,900
THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE CENTER EXAM

127
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,700
Yes.

128
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,933
Do you have time?

129
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,433
Here.

130
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:50,867
Tomorrow is the Center Exam.
So, you're taking the exam, right?

131
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,367
I sent an application.

132
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,333
I'm glad to hear.

133
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:08,000
I understand if you have some
other college in mind.

134
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,833
But if you go to Tokyo University,
your parents will be happy.

135
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,333
I'm always causing trouble for my dad.

136
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I envy you for having many chances
to make your parents happy.

137
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,533
That's all.

138
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,367
You--

139
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,567
What will you do at college?

140
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,467
What will I do?

141
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,833
I will study, and make friends
and things like that.

142
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,600
Are you taking the trouble to go there
to study that you don't even like?

143
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:56,400
I don't get it. Why does everyone
want to go to college so bad?

144
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:04,667
Colleges must exist
for people like you to study.

145
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,067
But I never thought that
I wanted to go to college.

146
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,133
I don't have to be taught in college.

147
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,600
If I want to study, I can do it myself.

148
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:17,833
That's not all, right? You can get a
certificate for what you want to do.

149
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,233
Then what do you want to do?

150
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:27,567
I don't know what it is yet.

151
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:33,667
The time you spend in college is
the time to search for it.

152
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,800
To search what you want to do
in the future.

153
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,033
You shouldn't keep your brain to yourself.

154
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,433
You have to contribute to
Japan's development.

155
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,233
You're amazing.

156
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,967
I've been thinking about it.

157
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,867
But why can you be determined
so much?

158
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:05,400
Even though you're working so hard,
why can't you do it?

159
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:08,933
I'm so impressed.

160
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,867
What's that? Are you being sarcastic?

161
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:19,300
I feel like you're the one to be envied.

162
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,867
I'll leave early tomorrow
so I'm going to bed now.

163
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,567
Good night.

164
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,367
I'll put this on then.

165
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,933
Perfect. Good luck.

166
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,233
Naoki is late.

167
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:15,333
Is he trying not to take Center Exam?

168
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,167
He'll be all right. He knows how you feel.

169
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,100
But he's stubborn once
he makes up his mind.

170
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,900
-What?
-Good morning, Naoki.

171
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,967
Nice morning, isn't it? Here it is.

172
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,467
-Your lunch.
-Thank you.

173
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,533
-What's wrong, Naoki?
-I feel a little hot.

174
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,200
-It seems like I caught cold.
-On an important day like this?

175
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,567
Oh, my! Got to make
the egg and sake drink.

176
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,633
No, green onions are better
for his throat.

177
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,133
-Medicine, medicine!
-Did we have Nukamiso?

178
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,733
It's okay. I'm going now.

179
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,600
-How about breakfast?
-I have no appetite. This is good.

180
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,867
-What?
-Irie, Irie.

181
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,133
Take this medicine. This works well.

182
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,367
That should work.

183
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:16,667
Just in case, does this medicine
make you drowsy?

184
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:28,500
"After you take this, avoid driving."

185
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,200
Throw it up. Get it out, Naoki.

186
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:36,100
I'll hold him so you put your fingers in.

187
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,767
That's enough.

188
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,867
I'm going now.

189
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,333
Irie.

190
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,033
Is he going to be okay?

191
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,467
-Good morning.
-Good morning. Hey--

192
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,600
Is that lucky charm handmade?

193
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:01,833
Did the girl who live with you
make it for you?

194
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,100
I'll throw it away once
I get to the venue.

195
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,267
No way. Poor her.

196
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,667
I kind of like her.

197
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,000
Excuse me, I'm getting off.

198
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,133
Thank you so much.

199
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,200
What's wrong, Irie?

200
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,667
That girl.

201
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,633
The lucky charm got stuck between
the doors. Pull it off.

202
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,300
Hey, it's not moving at all.

203
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,633
Irie, hurry.

204
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,433
Watanabe, you go ahead.

205
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,033
How about you?

206
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,567
I'll take care of this quickly.

207
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,167
Sorry, I'll go ahead.

208
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,400
-See you at the venue.
-Yeah.

209
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,667
I'm sorry.

210
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,600
Excuse me, the elevator has stopped.

211
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,733
I'm sorry.

212
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,467
Hey!

213
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,167
Good. It took you a while.

214
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,333
I was scolded by a station staff
for a long time.

215
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,400
It sounded like there were lots of
pranks to stop elevators.

216
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
I was blamed to be the suspect
on all the incidents.

217
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,200
I'll listen to you later. Let's go inside.

218
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,133
By the way,
what happened to that lucky charm?

219
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,100
It's so strong.

220
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,933
Isn't it bad luck?

221
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:42,833
Right.

222
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,900
I'll take it off.

223
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,567
It came off easily.

224
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,133
Irie!

225
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,867
-Someone fell off from the stairs.
-Someone.

226
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,233
Is anyone there?

227
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,467
Take both of them to
the nurse's office. Right now.

228
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,500
What a scary lucky charm!

229
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:33,000
Sorry, I'm late.

230
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,367
You're the student who fell from
the stairs. Hurry. 30 minutes left.

231
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:37,567
Yes.

232
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,800
It happened then.

233
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,067
Thank you.

234
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:37,100
Hey, Irie. I'm hesitant to ask you,
but how did you do?

235
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:42,133
I didn't see most of the problems
and answered with imagination.

236
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,733
You must have made it happen.

237
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,267
<i>Good luck!</i>

238
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,867
That girl.

239
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:10,300
What's up?
Is your lunch made by that girl?

240
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,100
You better not eat it.
You don't want to get diarrhea.

241
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,267
If these work for you.

242
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:20,133
Thanks. I appreciate it.

243
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,767
Hey, this is an unsolicited advice.

244
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,100
But you should throw that
lucky charm away.

245
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,700
It was gone when
I noticed at nurse's office.

246
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:34,233
That's good.
The misfortune has gone away then.

247
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,633
Ten more minutes left.

248
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,600
It was a disaster, wasn't it, Irie?

249
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:51,467
It makes you just about average
after these kinds of accidents.

250
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,867
I guess I'm not comforting you.

251
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,300
Hey, you.

252
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,233
It was a disaster, wasn't it?

253
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:04,167
Thank you for helping me.

254
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,100
No broken bones,
but you have to rest for a while.

255
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,267
Yes. Thank you.

256
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:16,000
So, I think it was yours.
But a lucky charm was left on a stair.

257
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,733
I put it in your chest pocket.

258
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:23,433
It was handmade so I thought
it must've been important.

259
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,633
I hope it would bring you luck.

260
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,167
I'm envious.

261
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,200
I feel like you and that girl will
stay together forever.

262
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,800
Stop it.

263
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,067
It's about time for Naoki to come home.

264
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,667
But he's late, isn't he?

265
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,167
That's him.

266
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,600
Naoki, what's wrong? What happened?

267
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,367
-I fell.
-What?

268
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:19,333
It's still a bad injury.

269
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,533
The lucky charm didn't work.

270
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:27,100
No, it worked really well.

271
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,767
What do you mean?

272
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,233
Never mind. I'm going to bed.

273
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,900
Brother.

274
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,800
-I failed Center Exam.
-Me too.

275
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:59,200
I have to go for private schools now.

276
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:04,133
Irie will be fine. He's a genius
who's the top of the nation.

277
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:08,467
I don't think that applies at this time.

278
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,033
Kotoko, Jinko.

279
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:16,367
Did you hear that?
Irie is applying to Tokyo University.

280
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,600
You're kidding. Where did you hear that?

281
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,300
There was a rumor in the teachers' office.

282
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:25,533
Among other applicants,
his grades are superior.

283
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,700
What a genius!

284
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,667
Wait, Kotoko. How come you're crying?

285
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,267
Well.

286
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,467
I'm so happy.

287
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:46,933
I'll go and tell Irie congratulations.

288
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,067
-She's got a passion of youth.
-Yeah.

289
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:05,100
<i>He was injured badly.</i>

290
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,400
<i>But he made it happen.</i>

291
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,567
<i>The person who I adore is really cool.</i>

292
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:18,667
<i>I wonder if that lucky charm</i>
<i>had helped him a little bit.</i>

293
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:38,533
I can apply to Tokyo University
thanks to your lucky charm.

294
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:41,933
Thank you.

295
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,200
Watch out!

296
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,267
Are you in class A?

297
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:10,333
Wait, what's wrong?
Do you know the Center Exam results?

298
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:15,333
Did Irie fail Center Exam as I thought?

299
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,333
What are you talking about?
Irie is all right.

300
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,933
He'll be able to
apply to Tokyo University.

301
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:28,000
What? Amazing. With that condition?

302
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,633
That condition?

303
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,600
It was terrible.
I've never seen Irie being like that.

304
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,067
Even if it was because of
that lucky charm.

305
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:42,233
-That lucky charm?
-Shoot!

306
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,733
-Wait, what do you mean?
-Nothing.

307
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,967
-Never mind.
-Tell me.

308
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,233
Stop it. I'll tell you.
I'll tell you, so--

309
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,467
Oh, I'm sorry.

310
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,033
I have to take an exam
for my first choice, Waseda University.

311
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,367
Your destroying power is so amazing.

312
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,167
-Destroying power?
-We can laugh about it now.

313
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:12,167
But horrible things happened that day
with your lucky charm power.

314
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:25,100
<i>His injury and all was because</i>
<i>of my lucky charm.</i>

315
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:28,767
<i>I...</i>

316
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,700
<i>put Irie through a great deal of</i>
<i>trouble.</i>

317
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,233
<i>I pray for Irie to get accepted to</i>
<i>Tokyo University.</i>

318
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,167
<i>I pray for Irie family's dream</i>

319
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,833
<i>to come true.</i>

320
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,867
Congratulations on your acceptance
to Tokyo University

321
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,733
<i>This is going to happen for sure.</i>

322
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,200
<i>It's a little early.</i>

323
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,733
<i>But the day after the exam</i>

324
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:46,900
<i>on St. Valentine's day,</i>
<i>I'll give it to him.</i>

325
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:27,267
<i>And the day of the destiny has come.</i>

326
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm leaving now.

327
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,433
You all don't have to see me off.

328
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,300
I'm worried about you.

329
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:39,600
I can drive you there.

330
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,167
I'm okay. My leg is healed up.

331
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,367
-I'm going now.
-Stay safe.

332
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:46,667
Have a nice day.

333
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,067
Have a nice day.

334
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,633
<i>It was terrible.</i>

335
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,433
I've never seen him like that.
Even if the lucky charm caused it all.

336
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:14,833
Kotoko?

337
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,900
I'll go see Irie off until he passes
the Tokyo University gate.

338
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,467
I don't want anything to happen.
See you later.

339
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:21,600
See you.

340
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,000
See you later.

341
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,400
It's so obvious that you're following me.

342
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:04,567
I thought I would see you off
by the Tokyo University gate.

343
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,800
Whoa, I slipped.

344
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,333
I'm sorry to say that
in front of a test taker.

345
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,133
Why is a banana peel here?

346
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:40,500
Ouch.

347
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:53,900
Everyone looks smart.

348
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,800
Aren't you walking a little weird?

349
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,867
Do you think so? It's normal.

350
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,400
You look pale too.

351
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,500
I'm just nervous.

352
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:11,633
Why are you being nervous?
I'm the one who's taking the exam.

353
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:18,567
<i>What should I do?</i>

354
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,067
<i>I've never had this kind of pain</i>
<i>in my stomach.</i>

355
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:29,667
<i>No, I have to see Irie go through</i>
<i>Tokyo University gate.</i>

356
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:36,967
<i>I can't make him worry</i>
<i>about me until then.</i>

357
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:43,033
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

358
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,000
Of course. Good luck on your exam.
See you later.

359
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,100
Bathroom.

360
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:55,833
Bathroom.

361
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,900
What's wrong? Anybody?

362
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,100
Are you okay? What's wrong?

363
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,333
-She just collapsed.
-Are you okay?

364
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,333
-Hang in there.
-Excuse me.

365
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,033
Hey, are you okay?

366
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,633
Excuse me, hospital.

367
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,367
Where's a hospital?

368
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:22,567
There's one over there.

369
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,200
<i>Irie.</i>

370
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,967
<i>Go take the exam.</i>

371
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:51,433
<i>Irie, you'll be late.</i>

372
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,767
<i>Take the exam.</i>

373
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:01,867
<i>Mr. Irie, Mrs. Irie, and</i>

374
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:06,467
<i>Yuki, all of them are</i>

375
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,500
<i>cheering for you.</i>

376
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:17,133
-Kotoko.
-Kotoko-chan.

377
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,233
Kotoko-chan.

378
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,267
Dad.

379
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,433
Mrs. Irie, Mr. Irie.

380
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,733
I--

381
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:46,033
Why am I here?

382
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:49,233
Kotoko, are you okay?

383
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,633
You had appendicitis,
but the antibiotics are working now.

384
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:58,967
-You can go home today.
-You'll be okay, Kotoko.

385
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:10,933
How about Irie?

386
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,300
He wasn't here when we got here.

387
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:18,233
I think he went to Tokyo University
right after he called us.

388
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:21,800
He must be taking the exam by now.

389
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,033
I'm relieved.

390
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:30,733
It's my fault if he can't take the exam.

391
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,067
I worried that if his life
would be ruined.

392
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,467
Kotoko-chan.

393
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,900
When you're suffering like this,

394
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,433
you're worrying about Naoki the most.

395
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,800
What about me?

396
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:59,633
Naoki, didn't you go take the exam?

397
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,667
Since I was hungry, I went out to eat.

398
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:05,167
How about the exam? Tokyo University?

399
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,000
Tokyo University? I didn't take the exam.

400
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,233
How can it be? No way.

401
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:22,133
Iri-chan, Mrs. Irie, and Naoki,
I'm terribly sorry.

402
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,133
Ai-chan.

403
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:28,000
Because of my daughter,
your son went through such a trouble.

404
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,467
Hey, get up. Not taking the exam is

405
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,567
what Naoki did with his own will.

406
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:38,467
Right. Besides even if he got into
Tokyo university,

407
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:42,300
I would have been disappointed
if he didn't help Kotoko.

408
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,033
-However--
-She's right.

409
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,000
It was the destiny.

410
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,167
-It's okay, Ai-chan.
-Please get up.

411
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,867
<i>Because of me,</i>

412
00:39:55,067 --> 00:40:00,000
<i>Irie's family is facing the worst time.</i>

413
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,567
Everyone in the Irie family

414
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:04,033
<i>Everyone in the Irie family,</i>

415
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:08,767
<i>thank you for taking care of me</i>
<i>until now.</i>

416
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,567
Good bye, Irie.

417
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:36,133
<i>I can't put you through trouble anymore.</i>

418
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,233
<i>I'll...</i>

419
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:45,100
<i>live my life somewhere where</i>
<i>you can't find me.</i>

420
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:54,500
Where should I go?

421
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,567
It's cold.

422
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,100
Do you want to hold
a hot can of coffee, then?

423
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:13,300
Irie.

424
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,467
Why?

425
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,133
No reason.

426
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,567
I couldn't fall asleep,
so I'm taking a walk.

427
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,767
It's warm.

428
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,433
Don't stop me. I can no longer--

429
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,067
I'm not stopping you.

430
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:48,933
Goodbye, then.

431
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,533
Are you leaving because
I didn't go to Tokyo University?

432
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:05,667
I think I'm a bad luck for you.

433
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,100
Not only Tokyo University,
but also the Center Exam--

434
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:14,867
I heard it.

435
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,133
From Watanabe in class A.

436
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:26,400
Maybe...

437
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:32,167
I'm someone who's awful for you.

438
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:34,800
Probably.

439
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:41,833
Nothing good happens when I'm with you.

440
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:46,400
My pace of life gets
messed up all the time.

441
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,500
A rumor was spread at school.

442
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,167
I was forced to teach you to study.

443
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,667
It affected
my college application in the end.

444
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,967
I'm the worst.

445
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,933
But...

446
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,200
it was kind of fun.

447
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,700
It was the first time in my life
to feel so anxious.

448
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,100
It was the first time for me
to feel anxious about my test result.

449
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:26,267
It was a crazy experience.

450
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,233
How about Tokyo University, though.

451
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,000
I tell you, but it's not your fault
that I didn't take the exam.

452
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,800
If I went there after
I dropped you off at the hospital,

453
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,200
I would have made it in time.

454
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,900
Then why?

455
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:53,300
You said that the college was the
place to decide what you do.

456
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,400
It has been fun to be around you
to feel anxious about things

457
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,567
that it may not be a bad idea to
get promoted to stay at Tonan.

458
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:14,533
I've been wondering what I would do
after I go to Tokyo University.

459
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:21,800
You mean you chose the
same college because I'm going?

460
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:26,533
I don't mean that.

461
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,867
But--

462
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:34,267
You can go now. Take care.

463
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,900
Wait.

464
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:46,367
Well, may I stay at the Irie residence
for little longer?

465
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:52,000
-I won't cause you trouble anymore.
-Stop lying.

466
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:54,467
There's no way you won't cause me trouble.

467
00:45:55,867 --> 00:46:01,667
You're right. Then I'll promise you
to have an exciting life.

468
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,100
You get carried away easily.

469
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:30,200
Hey, it's St. Valentine's Day, today,
isn't it?

470
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,200
So, what? Are you giving me
a chocolate or something?

471
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:37,300
I'm sorry.

472
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,200
Were you counting on me?

473
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,967
I wasn't.

474
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:12,100
There it is.

475
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:38,900
It tastes bad.

476
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:44,367
Congratulations on your acceptance
to Tokyo University

477
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,700
{\an8}<i>White Valentine's day.</i>

478
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,267
<i>My feelings towards him was</i>
<i>fruitless this year.</i>

479
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:04,933
<i>But someday I hope...</i>

480
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,333
<i>my feelings towards him...</i>

481
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,500
<i>get accepted.</i>

482
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,433
First kiss.

483
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,967
NEXT EPISODE

484
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,000
The couple that kiss on the graduation day

485
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,000
will stay together forever.

486
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,367
Let's make it the best graduation
and the party.

487
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:09,800
Kotoko, am I not good enough?

488
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:12,533
It's not like I don't like Kin-chan.

489
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,133
I'm going to kiss Kotoko tonight.

490
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:17,200
If it's a dream,
why don't you go to sleep?

491
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:18,933
Are you going to like me?

492
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,167
{\an8}She's noticed
who treats her the best.

493
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,400
{\an8}What a cold blooded guy!

494
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,467
