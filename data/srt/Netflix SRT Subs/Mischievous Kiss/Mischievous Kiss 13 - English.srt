1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,167
What is your future plan? We'll be looking
for a job this time next year.

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,667
I must get started.

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:10,333
<i>Everyone has a future plan.</i>

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,500
<i>But I don't know what I want to do.</i>

5
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:18,300
I want my son to take over my company.
Is that too much to ask?

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:22,000
If Naoki doesn't want it,
you still have Yuki.

7
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:25,633
Yuki? It will be too late.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,133
We need to talk.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,767
I want you to take over my company.

10
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,567
Give me a break.
I can't choose my profession?

11
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,000
I can't even choose my girlfriend.

12
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,433
That's why I want to leave this home.
I want freedom.

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,667
Mr. Irie!

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,367
I want to be a doctor.
That's the first profession...

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,167
I got interested in.

16
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,200
Don't tell it to anyone yet.

17
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,533
<i>I wonder why</i>
<i>he confided his secret to me.</i>

18
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,667
I didn't have a chance to tell it
to Naoki, but...

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,533
to tell you the truth--

20
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:11,600
Honey.

21
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:18,367
Honey, are you okay? Naoki! Naoki!

22
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,100
It is unstable angina.

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,533
I informed him of it
after the annual medical exam.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,167
-He didn't tell us anything.
-Really?

25
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:46,967
I guess he didn't want to upset you
by sharing the news.

26
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,200
How is his condition?

27
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,400
This attack was a light one.
But he may suffer cardiac infarct

28
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,367
if he doesn't rest.

29
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,000
-That serious?
-I don't want it to happen.

30
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,467
Let's see how the medication will affect
his condition.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,333
No more work for him.

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,833
-Mrs. Irie, how is he doing?
-My husband

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,567
has had a heart issue for a long time.

34
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,533
But he didn't tell me anything.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,167
I guess he pushed himself
too much for us.

36
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm sorry to hear that.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,000
He will have absolute rest for a while and
let's see how his condition improves.

38
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,267
So, he is all right as long as he has
absolute rest. Right?

39
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,433
He is all right for now.

40
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:52,033
I didn't realize that he had been
suffering it.

41
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:56,233
I'm a bad wife.

42
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,800
It's not your fault.

43
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,733
Irie-chan has a strong sense
of responsibility.

44
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:05,700
He may have shouldered too much
burden and gotten stressed by that.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,567
At least, it's not life-threatening.
You should feel lucky for that.

46
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:16,433
But what will happen to his company
if he cannot work?

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I will take it over.

48
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:22,967
But you said that

49
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,233
you didn't want to take it over.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,733
Dad knew his heart condition.

51
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,067
That's why he asked me to take it over.

52
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:41,800
So, don't worry. I will take care of
his company.

53
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,100
Thank you, son.

54
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,833
<i>I'm the only one who knows</i>

55
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,667
<i>what Irie's real dream is.</i>

56
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,533
<i>Irie wants to become a doctor.</i>

57
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>He finally figured out what he wanted to</i>
<i>do in his life.</i>

58
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:05,000
<i>But does he have to give it up?</i>
<i>No other choice?</i>

59
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:04,733
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

60
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,333
{\an8}QUIRK OF FATE

61
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,767
{\an8}Will Irie take over his dad's company?

62
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:18,300
{\an8}Irie applied to take leave of absence from
the university.

63
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,967
Until Mr. Irie gets better,

64
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,167
Naoki will devote his time to the company.

65
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,233
I see. He is having a hard time, huh?

66
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
But I'm sure Irie can handle it.

67
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,200
-He is a genius.
-That's right.

68
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,033
And I'm sure that he has been aware of
his dad's expectation

69
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,067
for him to take over the company some
day.

70
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,800
And how is Mr. Irie doing?

71
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,500
Kotoko? Kotoko?

72
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,967
Mr. Irie? He will stay in the hospital
to have absolute rest for a while.

73
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:58,133
And Naoki will come back home
to live with us.

74
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,433
-I guess Mr. Irie will be relieved.
-I see.

75
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Wait. This might be a good opportunity

76
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,700
for Irie and Kotoko to get closer.

77
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,933
If you are sick or hospitalized,

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,900
you tend to let your guard down, so, you
have a higher chance to fall in love.

79
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,333
But Irie is not the one who is in
the hospital. It's his dad.

80
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,067
I know that, but I'm sure Irie
is also uneasy.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,467
If Irie feels helpless,

82
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:30,200
I will do anything to help him.

83
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,200
-Anything.
-Good, Kotoko.

84
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:38,833
But I don't mean to do that in order to
attract his attention.

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,100
Think about it. His dad is sick

86
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,000
and the company is in trouble.

87
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm happy that Irie is coming back to live
with us again.

88
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:54,267
But I would be happier
if his dad gets better

89
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,833
and Irie comes back to the university...

90
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,500
to study again...

91
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,267
even if we must live apart.

92
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,100
Come on. You can be honest with us.

93
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,067
Kotoko, I admire what you said.

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,867
-That's why I like you.
-Kin-chan.

95
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,133
"Admire what you said"?

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,233
You just don't want to see Kotoko and Irie
become a couple.

97
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,467
You idiot.

98
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,833
It's not time for such a thing.

99
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:36,200
Irie Family is in turmoil.

100
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,500
Irie won't show it, but I'm sure

101
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,067
that he is helpless and uneasy.

102
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,167
Kotoko, do anything to help him.

103
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,033
You are right.

104
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,800
Let us know if we can help him
in any way.

105
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,000
Do not hesitate. Just ask us.

106
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,800
Thank you, Kin-chan.

107
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,533
It's time. I have to go.

108
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,733
-See you later.
-See you.

109
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,633
Hey, Kin-chan. What was that?

110
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,800
"What was that"? What do you mean?

111
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,967
Don't tell me that you've given up
on Kotoko.

112
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,667
-You are ready to surrender?
-Idiot.

113
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,933
I won't stoop low.

114
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,433
I want to show humanity
even to my enemy.

115
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:39,067
If I take advantage of the turmoil
in the Irie Family

116
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,000
and steal Kotoko away from Irie...

117
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,600
I won't be able to live with myself.

118
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,600
It's funny. You sound like Kotoko.

119
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,933
Don't you think?

120
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:56,100
What you are saying

121
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,867
is the same as what Kotoko said.

122
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,867
Happiness of your love interest is more
important than your own happiness.

123
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:05,533
Yes. You are like Kotoko.

124
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,167
You and Kotoko could make...

125
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,567
a perfect couple. Too bad.

126
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,500
Too bad.

127
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,867
Just kidding.

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,467
-Kotoko loves only Irie.
-What?

129
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,333
That's right.

130
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,233
Enjoy the meal. Tonight we have
simmered taro,

131
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,233
yellowtail teriyaki, miso soup,

132
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,467
beans with sesame paste,

133
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:44,867
and what else? Boiled tofu.

134
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
-Spicy. It's too spicy.
-Too spicy?

135
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:55,967
That's not possible. Why?

136
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,233
-Wow, it's spicy.
- Brother.

137
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,600
Don't eat it. It's too spicy.

138
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,933
It's spicy... spicy.

139
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,800
Brother, what was that sound?

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,300
It's taro.

141
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,233
Simmered taro is usually soft
and wouldn't make such a sound.

142
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,500
It means... it's not cooked enough.

143
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:37,367
-Brother, spit it out.
-You don't need to eat it.

144
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,867
Yuki, stop complaining and
finish the meal.

145
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,400
Hi, Irie.

146
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,200
Would you like a cup of coffee?

147
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:23,967
Please.

148
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,367
Irie...

149
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,600
will you take over your dad's company?

150
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,100
You told me that you wanted
to be a doctor.

151
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,767
I don't want to run away
from the challenge.

152
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,167
I told you.

153
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:09,033
I've faced so many challenges one after
another since I met you.

154
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,433
But I didn't expect my father to get sick.

155
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:20,267
I won't run away from the challenge.

156
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,433
-Irie...
-Once he gets better,

157
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,100
I will go back to the university.

158
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,900
It won't be too late for me
to do what I really want.

159
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,867
It would be nice to experience
the real world now.

160
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,167
I see.

161
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,600
Let me know if there is anything
I can do.

162
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,500
Right. I was making coffee.

163
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,567
Nice to meet you. I'm Kanamori.

164
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,333
I will assist you
while the president is in the hospital.

165
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,233
This is your chair.

166
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,500
Now let me brief you on the documents
you received the other day.

167
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,700
No, thanks. I read all of them last night.

168
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,700
All of them by yourself?

169
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,733
It looks like that this year's profit is
down significantly from last year.

170
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,200
Yes. Please take a look at the inventory
of our company's signature product.

171
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,300
The sales are drastically down.

172
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,967
We've lost our customers to our rivals'
similar products.

173
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,400
The president has been really concerned
about it.

174
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:26,233
Pandai may end up being taken over by a
bigger company if it doesn't improve.

175
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,567
We need a huge amount of extra cash
to survive right now.

176
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:38,433
I can't blame his heart for failing.

177
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,767
Good.

178
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,733
Irie is working so hard.

179
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,667
I should follow his lead.

180
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,900
I will work hard on domestic chores.

181
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,500
Yes, I'm ready.

182
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,300
I look like...

183
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,767
a newly-wed wife.

184
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:13,567
Fight... well...

185
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,700
H comes before G? Or vice versa?

186
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,000
Who cares?

187
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:25,033
<i>A heart mark. A heart mark.</i>
<i>Love. Love. Heart.</i>

188
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,733
{\an8}G should come before H.

189
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,700
Welcome home.

190
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,600
You want to take a bath or dinner first?

191
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,900
I'll take that.

192
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,967
Inhale.

193
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,067
Now exhale.

194
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,133
Wait. Irie.

195
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,100
Here is your bag.

196
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,067
Have a great day.

197
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,533
Do your best.

198
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,667
From every product,

199
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,867
we seek cash revenue.

200
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:43,433
By producing animation, I will get the TV
right and others...

201
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:48,700
We will expand our unique business
model into the global market.

202
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,200
Too much miso makes the soup salty.
You know that?

203
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,433
You are right. It's too salty.

204
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,267
But taro is cooked perfectly today.

205
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,533
I regret to inform you, but I can't
continue the club activity.

206
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,467
I see.

207
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:31,633
-Isn't Irie's father doing well?
-That's right.

208
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,867
That's why I don't have time for the club.

209
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,967
I understand.

210
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,033
Irie and you are important members
of our club.

211
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:45,800
We want you to come back once his
father gets well. The door is always open.

212
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,967
Thank you, Mr. Sudo.

213
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:51,600
You are not the only one.
We all care about Irie.

214
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,633
Some girls are in love with him.

215
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,100
-Like Ayako Matsumoto.
-Captain.

216
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:59,467
Sorry I'm late.

217
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,000
-I can't participate in today's practice.
-What?

218
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,933
We don't want freshmen to miss a
practice without advance notice.

219
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,200
That's why I'm here to tell it to you.
I have a date with my boyfriend.

220
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,400
Boyfriend? When did it happen?

221
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:16,100
Sorry, but I will take Ayako today.

222
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,933
Kotoko, I've heard about Naoki's father.

223
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,467
Tell him that I'm cheering for him.

224
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,667
Goodbye.

225
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:32,167
I thought she was totally in love
with Irie.

226
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:37,067
-How could she...?
-New generation.

227
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,700
-She is a new generation, huh?
-What do you mean?

228
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:44,633
-She is too young for me to understand.
-Really?

229
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:56,867
Sorry, Kotoko. Can we talk now?

230
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:10,267
And how is Irie doing?

231
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,000
He is very busy with the company's
business.

232
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,700
He comes home around midnight
every day.

233
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:21,833
I'm up every night until he comes home.

234
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,833
Is it possible that he will drop out of
the college completely

235
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,133
and take over the company permanently?

236
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,667
Don't go there yet. He is taking time off
from school.

237
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,900
-I'm sure he will come back some day.
-I doubt that.

238
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:43,067
If he takes over the company, he doesn't
need a college degree.

239
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:44,967
But...

240
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,500
Once he gets better,
I will go back to the university.

241
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:53,233
It won't be too late for me
to do what I really want in my life.

242
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,100
It would be nice to experience
the real world now.

243
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,267
Irie wants...

244
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,967
to come back to the university someday.

245
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,167
Even if he wants it,

246
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,300
the reality may not allow it.
That's all I'm saying.

247
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,733
By the way, why don't you relieve him
from your bento box lunch?

248
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
His lunch time is hell right now.

249
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,333
How do you know that I'm making
his lunch?

250
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,767
I know everything between you two.

251
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,767
I assume nothing happened
between you two.

252
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,900
That's not...

253
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,300
-That's not...
-Bye.

254
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:07,533
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

255
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,567
-Mommy.
-I'm so glad

256
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,633
to be at home. Testing, visitors,
et cetera.

257
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,000
Life is busy at the hospital.

258
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,900
Can Mr. Irie see visitors now?

259
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:24,067
His doctor wants him to have absolute
rest,

260
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,967
but he can't stay away from his business.

261
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,833
But I have good news.
My husband may be able

262
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,800
to come home next month.

263
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:37,233
-Really?
-I'm glad to hear that.

264
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,033
It depends on the result
of the next complete physical.

265
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,233
But right now his condition is stable
and he can go home temporarily.

266
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,167
I'm sure that our home is a better place

267
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,833
for him to relax than the hospital.

268
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,167
-You are right about that.
-Kotoko, I need

269
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,667
your help a little longer.

270
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,700
Don't worry about that. You should take
care of yourself.

271
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:04,867
Thank you. I will pick up a change of
clothes and go back to the hospital.

272
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,933
-Yuki, behave yourself. Okay?
-Okay.

273
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:18,767
<i>I'm so glad. Once Mr. Irie comes home,</i>

274
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,200
<i>Naoki can go back to the university.</i>

275
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,533
<i>He can start studying to become a doctor,</i>
<i>which is his dream.</i>

276
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,200
Thanks to the doctor, he can leave
the hospital next month.

277
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,833
That's great news.

278
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,300
You are lucky to have
such a brilliant son.

279
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,733
He is doing well as an acting president.

280
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,833
I can't believe that he is still
a college student.

281
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,667
I count on you, son.

282
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,967
Naoki?

283
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,300
That's strange.

284
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:06,333
I thought that we were the only visitors
he had today.

285
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,667
-I see.
-Father.

286
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:20,800
-You should be resting.
-Chairman Oizumi?

287
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:24,133
Hi. I happened to be in this area,
so I paid a visit.

288
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:29,767
Naoki, this is Mr. Oizumi of Hokuei-sha
and his secretary, Mr. Yokoyama.

289
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,033
I should have introduced myself first.
I'm Naoki Irie.

290
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:36,833
Irie?

291
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:41,133
Mr. Chairman, this is my son, Naoki.

292
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,100
He is receiving his training
in my company.

293
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,867
-I see. He is a promising young man.
-Mr. Chairman.

294
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,367
This may be a great opportunity to share
the news.

295
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:52,600
President Irie.

296
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,700
Regarding our investment

297
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,967
in your company.

298
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,867
Stop it, Yokoyama. It shouldn't be
discussed in a hospital room.

299
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:04,267
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:08,133
I thought that his son and Mr. Kanamori
should hear this news, too.

301
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,433
Sure. That would be fine.

302
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
-Honey, pass me the documents.
-But...

303
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:18,567
I'm sorry to ask you, but can we discuss
it some other time?

304
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:23,100
Naoki, don't be rude
to Chairman Oizumi.

305
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:26,667
I'm sorry, but Father needs
absolute rest now.

306
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:30,067
He is not healthy enough to
handle business matters.

307
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,333
Mr. Chairman, in that case,

308
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:38,967
I recommend you reconsider this
investment.

309
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,900
-Mr. Chairman.
-On behalf of my father,

310
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:49,400
I will listen to your plan.

311
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,267
That's not appropriate. You are too young.

312
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,200
Currently I'm the acting president.

313
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:00,400
I will pay you a visit
at your office tomorrow.

314
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,767
I would appreciate your patience.

315
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,600
I want Father to have complete rest.

316
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,200
Naoki, that's not...

317
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,467
Please let me handle the business while
you are in the hospital.

318
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,167
I planned to pay a sympathy visit to you.

319
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:20,033
That's all I wanted, but I brought you
trouble instead.

320
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,767
I'm going, Mr. Irie.

321
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,900
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry for my son's attitude.

322
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,267
Yokoyama.

323
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,633
-Check my schedule tomorrow.
-Yes?

324
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,867
I need to know what time I'm available.

325
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,367
You have free time before having lunch
with the minister.

326
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,000
Between 11 and 12.

327
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:47,033
Does that work for you?

328
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,133
Thank you for your patience.
I will be there at 11.

329
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,600
Who could make an appointment
with Mr. Oizumi?

330
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:11,000
-Naoki is a very impressive man.
-I totally agree.

331
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,067
That doesn't happen often.

332
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:33,600
That's why we believe that you will earn
significant revenue from this deal.

333
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,067
What do you think, Yokoyama?

334
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,433
It was a great presentation
by a student

335
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,200
who learned business

336
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,267
only in the classroom.

337
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,733
I'm sorry to say this,

338
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,233
but I belonged to the Engineering
Department in the university.

339
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,400
I learned business by myself.

340
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,500
I see.

341
00:27:57,367 --> 00:28:00,867
You are supposed to be the president
of Pandai someday, aren't you?

342
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,267
-Why did you major in Engineering?
-I wanted to expose myself

343
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,900
to broader knowledge and views.

344
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,367
I don't believe that someone with a narrow
view can be successful in the real world.

345
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,333
Are you all right?

346
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,367
Yes.

347
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:45,667
Take care.

348
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,900
Naoki, thank you for coming.

349
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,967
You are busy at work, aren't you?

350
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,767
That's okay. Just tell me what the
important thing you want to discuss is.

351
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't want Yuki to hear about it.

352
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,033
Welcome home.
You are late as usual, huh?

353
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,200
I will warm up your dinner quickly.

354
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,300
I don't need it.

355
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,767
Have you already had dinner?

356
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,767
I have no appetite.

357
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,567
Good morning.

358
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,967
-Here is your bento box lunch.
-Thanks.

359
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,900
You look very tired.

360
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,567
Are you okay?

361
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,533
Irie?

362
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:58,600
I was thinking something.

363
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,133
See you later.

364
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,000
Have a good day.

365
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,233
Is he okay?

366
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,700
-Here you go.
-Wow, my mouth waters.

367
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,200
Your father made it for you.

368
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,600
He knows that you are working so hard
to feed the boys.

369
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,967
Thank you. This cheers me up.

370
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:36,767
Thank your father directly.

371
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,967
Hey, Kotoko.

372
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,933
You are missing some classes,
aren't you?

373
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,733
Are you happy with that?

374
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,067
It was my decision
to go to the university.

375
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,633
So, I still want to finish my degree.

376
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,300
But right now I want to help
the Irie Family.

377
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,633
Irie Family? No.

378
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:08,233
You mean Irie. Am I right?

379
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,033
I know you, so I can tell.

380
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Sometimes I wish that
I couldn't read your feelings so well.

381
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,400
Kin-chan...

382
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,367
no matter what happens...

383
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,267
I will be there for you.

384
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:36,733
Don't take it all on yourself. Let me know
if there is anything I can do.

385
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:41,733
I can cook. I can answer the roll call
for you in your class.

386
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,333
Thank you.

387
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,000
The only thing I cannot do is

388
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,333
write a class report on your behalf.

389
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,467
If I do that,

390
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,567
you will fail the class.

391
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:14,833
The dinner is delicious, isn't it?

392
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,300
Your dad made this, didn't he?

393
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,367
I'm so busted.

394
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,133
It's easy to tell that.

395
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,300
This meal is in a different class
from yours.

396
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,933
Don't be mean to me. I'm trying.

397
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,633
Can't you thank me once in a while
at least?

398
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,333
Thanks.

399
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,867
You are always mean to me.
What did you say?

400
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,600
Your cooking is still bad, but at least
getting better.

401
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,533
Thank you for the meal.

402
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,000
He is really late today.

403
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,000
That must be Irie.

404
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,633
No, it's from Mr. Sudo.

405
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,867
-Hello?
-Aihara. We have a problem.

406
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:55,167
-What's going on?
-I just...

407
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,300
I decided to confess my love to
Matsumoto.

408
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,300
Finally you confessed?

409
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,567
No. I was about to do that.

410
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,400
Not yet?

411
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,167
Then why are you calling me?

412
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,700
That's not the point.
Matsumoto told me

413
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,200
that she loves someone else.

414
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:16,700
That's not surprising.

415
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:19,367
She is in love with Irie.

416
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,700
You knew that, didn't you?

417
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:25,067
That's not the issue here.
I knew that.

418
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,733
Matsumoto is going

419
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,500
to confess her love to Irie.

420
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:33,100
If she is in love with someone,
naturally she wants to confess--

421
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,767
What?!

422
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:39,433
Ms. Matsumoto will confess her love
to Irie?

423
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,633
When will she do that?

424
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:44,900
Tonight.

425
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,400
Tonight?!

426
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:54,933
I wonder where and when Ms. Matsumoto

427
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,300
will confess her love to Irie.

428
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:05,200
Don't tell me that it's too late?

429
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,533
No!

430
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,867
I'm sorry

431
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,233
to ambush you like this.

432
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,333
You must have been waiting for me
so long.

433
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,267
You could wait for me at my home if you
have something to say.

434
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,733
It won't work.

435
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,100
I wanted to have a private moment
with you.

436
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,667
I know that it is very selfish

437
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,167
to disturb you while
you are having a rough time.

438
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:21,533
But...

439
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:24,333
But what?

440
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:29,400
I love you.

441
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,833
I said it clearly.

442
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:42,633
So, I want your clear response.

443
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,033
What do you think about me?

444
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,833
I'm sorry.

445
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,033
You are just a friend...

446
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,133
for me.

447
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:19,967
I really love you.

448
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,200
I've never had such a feeling.

449
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,167
That's why...

450
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,433
I can't give up on you.

451
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,000
Are you satisfied now?

452
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm sorry,

453
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:00,433
but I don't want to do that with
you.

454
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:03,600
Why? Am I not good enough?

455
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:05,700
Then...

456
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,100
whom are you willing to kiss?

457
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,233
I did kiss.

458
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,333
I kissed Kotoko.

459
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm humiliated.

460
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,233
My pride is hurt.

461
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:52,233
I will be praying for a speedy recovery
for your father.

462
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,100
<i>He kissed me,</i>

463
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,500
<i>but it happened more than a year ago.</i>

464
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,900
<i>Why did he bring it up now?</i>

465
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:19,867
Hey.

466
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:24,933
Do not eavesdrop on someone's intimate
conversation.

467
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,933
I'm sorry.

468
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:33,267
You were late, so, I was worried.

469
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,333
Irie?

470
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:31,867
To tell you the truth,
father is not doing well.

471
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:37,967
My mother and I...

472
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,700
met his doctor today.

473
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:47,667
It appears that his condition is stable.

474
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,267
But the test found...

475
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,467
a serious issue in his heart.

476
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,433
He has to have surgery...

477
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,933
as soon as possible.

478
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,467
Is it a difficult surgery?

479
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,700
It's a heart issue.

480
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,667
Even if it is done successfully,

481
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,333
he cannot go back to work for a while.

482
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:25,933
I see.

483
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,800
I believe that stress caused...

484
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,067
his heart issue.

485
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:39,867
Because of the recession,

486
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:43,600
the revenue of his company has gone
down drastically.

487
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:46,933
That's why...

488
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:51,167
he wanted me to take over his company

489
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:52,633
as soon as possible.

490
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,467
I want you

491
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,633
to take over my company.

492
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,667
Pandai may end up

493
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:04,833
being taken over by a bigger company.

494
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,400
If I take over the company...

495
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:13,433
everything will be fine.

496
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,433
But you have a dream to be a doctor.

497
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,200
It is not a long-time dream.

498
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,133
I want to become...

499
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,000
a doctor.

500
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:39,033
I don't know whether I'm good at it
or not.

501
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:44,500
But I want to try it.

502
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,067
Are you giving up your dream?

503
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,100
Irie?

504
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,000
Being a doctor is...

505
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,933
the first profession
I got interested in.

506
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,300
<i>He looked so sad.</i>

507
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:41,467
<i>I couldn't...</i>

508
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:44,167
<i>help but hug him.</i>

509
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,500
<i>But Irie didn't refuse it.</i>

510
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:55,433
<i>At that moment...</i>

511
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:01,600
<i>I felt connected emotionally with Irie.</i>

512
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,467
Here is your bento box lunch.

513
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:31,000
I made the rolled omelet pretty well
today.

514
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:33,700
I also grilled green onion.

515
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:36,100
They say that green onion makes you
smarter.

516
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:37,767
Then why don't you eat it?

517
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:44,900
Have a good day.

518
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,200
<i>Despite that...</i>

519
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:54,400
We are very honored to have you
in our office.

520
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:57,167
-Thank you for coming.
-That's not a big deal.

521
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,133
I happened to be in this area. That's why.

522
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,500
Did you come here by yourself?

523
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:08,667
I'm here to discuss a personal issue
with you.

524
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,600
With me?

525
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,933
Are you interested in meeting your
prospective marriage partner?

526
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:25,833
I know it's a bad time since Mr. Irie
is in the hospital.

527
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,667
I have a granddaughter.

528
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:34,167
She is the same age as you and attends
University of Sacred Heart.

529
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,500
It's one of the most prestigious schools.

530
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:42,633
What do you think?
Think of it like a blind date.

531
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,067
You are still young.
I know it's not an easy decision.

532
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:54,167
Please discuss with your parents

533
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,800
and let me know at your earliest
convenience.

534
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:04,033
Let's discuss about our investment matter
after that.

535
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,100
Sorry to visit you
without advance notice.

536
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:09,567
No problem, sir.

537
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:13,500
Naoki,

538
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:16,500
please consider it very carefully.

539
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:20,033
Thank you for coming today.

540
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,500
Naoki...

541
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:34,167
This is a great opportunity

542
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:35,533
for the company.

543
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:37,833
Am I right?

544
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,600
<i>We are about to have...</i>

545
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:56,133
<i>a new development in our fate.</i>

546
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:32,867
{\an8}Is it true that you will meet a
marriage partner?

547
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:36,567
{\an8}-Yes. I like her.
-Do you remember me?

548
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:39,967
-I won't forget a beautiful woman.
-I got a good idea.

549
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:43,767
To ruin his formal meeting? I'm in.

550
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:48,233
This is different.
This is a matter

551
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,033
between two families.

552
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,767
I will steal Kotoko from you.

553
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:54,233
Do whatever you want.

554
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,333
{\an8}Brother, you love Kotoko, don't you?

555
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,600
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

556
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,433
{\an8}Everything will be fine.
