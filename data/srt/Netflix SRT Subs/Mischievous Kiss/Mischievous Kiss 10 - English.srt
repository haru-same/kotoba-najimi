1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:03,267
Irie moved out?

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's go spy on him

3
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:06,733
at his work.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,100
What?

5
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,433
They live together?

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,100
Fainting with this degree

7
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,333
maybe because of her
mental shock.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,400
Naoki comes

9
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,067
to my house.

10
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,533
I know.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,200
They live together, right?

12
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:24,600
He's tutoring me at my house.

13
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,700
Tutoring?

14
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,933
I moved out to be
all by myself,

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,633
but why even bother living
with someone?

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,767
Alrighty!

17
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,500
<i>The suspicion of living with</i>
<i>Matsumoto has been cleared,</i>

18
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,333
<i>but Irie still lives by himself.</i>

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,133
<i>The days have passed,</i>

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,767
<i>and the first winter</i>
<i>after we entered college</i>

21
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,967
<i>was about to begin.</i>

22
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:52,267
Eating this will make
everyone smile.

23
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,967
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

24
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,267
<i>Mr. Irie and dad's</i>
<i>classmate is</i>

25
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,467
<i>getting remarried in</i>
<i>their hometown in Kyusyu.</i>

26
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>Mrs. Irie is also</i>

27
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:04,600
<i>attending the wedding.</i>

28
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>Now they're going on</i>
<i>an overnight trip.</i>

29
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,567
-Okay.
-I'm ready.

30
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,733
We'll be back tomorrow night.

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,400
Kotoko, Yuki, take care
of the house until then.

32
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:20,567
Yes. Mrs. Irie, I made sandwiches
for you.

33
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,767
Thank you, Kotoko.

34
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,700
Kotoko, don't feed anything
weird to Yuki.

35
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:29,633
I'm becoming a better cook
than I used to be.

36
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,067
Are you sure you're okay
by yourselves?

37
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,633
Shall I bring Naoki back here?

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,700
We'll be okay. It's only one night.

39
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,867
Irie must be busy for himself.

40
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,433
But...

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,000
You should let your hair down
once in a while.

42
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,033
Then we're counting on you.

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,367
Call us if anything happens.

44
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,667
Okay, we're going now.

45
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,867
-See you later.
-Have a nice trip.

46
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,133
Okay, let's go.

47
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,533
All right.

48
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,567
Yuki, what would you like
for dinner tonight?

49
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,133
Anything.

50
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,367
There. I made your favorite...

51
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,933
hamburger.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,533
Hamburgers are hard
to make them into a right shape.

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,867
I made them into the size that's
easy to eat.

54
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,400
Please, eat them.

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,467
How is it?

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,567
I got the recipe from Kin-chan.

57
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:51,667
I think I did a good job.

58
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:54,233
It's better than it looks.

59
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,633
I'm glad.

60
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,967
Eat all the vegetables
on the plate.

61
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,867
There are more soup and rice.

62
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,767
Eat a lot, Yuki.

63
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,933
I'm going to eat now.

64
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,400
Actually, this is Japanese style.

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,567
have you noticed it?
It's Japanese style.

66
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,533
Kin-chan taught me how.

67
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,500
What's wrong, Yuki?

68
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,200
Yuki?

69
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,333
What's wrong?

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,233
What's wrong? What's wrong?

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,567
-Does it hurt? What's wrong?
-It hurts.

72
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,567
-It hurts?
-My stomach.

73
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,300
Stomach?

74
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,167
My stomach hurts.

75
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,100
Is that because of my hamburger?

76
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,800
Are you okay, Yuki?

77
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,500
Yuki, are you okay?
Hang in there, Yuki.

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,467
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

79
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,567
There.

80
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,800
{\an8}So that you don't get cold.

81
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,700
{\an8}CONFESSION ON A SNOWY NIGHT

82
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,333
{\an8}Sorry.

83
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,100
His temperature is high.

84
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,533
Towel, towel.

85
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,300
Here.

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,900
Wait.

87
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,267
I'll cool you down. Hold on.

88
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,200
Here you go.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Next,

90
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,533
I'll call Mrs. Irie.

91
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,533
MRS. IRIE

92
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,100
I have to.

93
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:54,033
<i>It's connected to</i>
<i>an answering machine.</i>

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,833
That's right.

95
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:59,333
They're at the wedding party
after the reception.

96
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,867
Irie, Irie, Irie.

97
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,167
That's right.

98
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,267
He doesn't have a cell phone.

99
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,033
I don't know his home phone number.
What can I do?

100
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,867
Wait.

101
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,867
Yuki, wait.

102
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,567
Okay, okay.

103
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,367
This is Japanese restaurant,
Aihara.

104
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:22,133
Kin-chan, how do you cure
food poisoning?

105
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,200
Kotoko? Is this Kotoko?

106
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,233
What's wrong? Food.

107
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,033
Did you get food poisoning?

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,300
Not me, Yuki.

109
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,800
Mrs. Irie is on a trip.

110
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,333
Irie

111
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,833
doesn't have a cell phone so
I can't contact him.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,833
Where's Irie's house?

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,033
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>He doesn't tell anybody.</i>

114
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,733
What's wrong?

115
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,733
Bro, It sounds like Irie's brother
got food poisoning.

116
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,367
How do you cure food poisoning?

117
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,667
Give it to me.

118
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,567
Kotoko, what did he eat?

119
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,167
The hamburger that I made.

120
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,667
<i>It may have not been fully cooked.</i>

121
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,933
It wasn't fully cooked?

122
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,633
Calm down, calm down.

123
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,733
You ate that hamburger, too, right?

124
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,100
-Yes, I did.
-She ate it.

125
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,900
But you're okay, right?

126
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,267
Yes. You may be right.

127
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,500
Then the hamburger
is not the cause.

128
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,400
But after Yuki ate hamburger,

129
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,500
-he started having stomachache.
-Food poisoning is not the only one.

130
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,067
Other sickness like appendicitis
can be considered.

131
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:28,600
<i>Don't make a judgment yourself,</i>
<i>it's better to see a doctor.</i>

132
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,267
-<i>Call an ambulance right now.</i>
-Ambulance, okay.

133
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,800
I'll find Irie and take him there.

134
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,100
Yes. Please do.

135
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,433
Call me once you know the hospital.
Okay, Kotoko?

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,800
Thank you, Kin-chan.

137
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,700
-Bro, can I take off now?
-Yeah, don't worry.

138
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,733
-I'll take care of it.
-Thank you so much.

139
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,633
Excuse me, an ambulance, please.

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,333
Yes. Naoki Irie.

141
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,100
No, I was wrong.

142
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,100
Kotoko Aihara. Kotoko Aihara. Right.

143
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,633
Yes. Kotoko.

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,733
No, Yuki Irie.

145
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,833
Yuki Irie. Yes. Yuki Irie.

146
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,267
Kin-chan, what happened?
Is Kotoko okay?

147
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,500
They're heading to Takao Hospital.

148
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,800
Anyway, don't you know
where Irie is?

149
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,700
I don't think Irie told his new
address to even his parents.

150
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,600
Engineer guys didn't know it either.

151
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,500
I don't think there's anybody else
who knows about it.

152
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,767
What's that?

153
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,633
Doesn't the Student Affairs office
know it?

154
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,633
Student Affairs office isn't open
at this time of the day.

155
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:45,100
I know. He is tutoring
at Matsumoto's house

156
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,567
who's in Tennis Club.

157
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,333
Matsumoto may know something.

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,067
Also he works at a cafe.
Kotoko told us.

159
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,167
-Which cafe is it?
-Well...

160
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,033
Kotoko knows it, right?

161
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,333
Yuki, hang in there.

162
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,600
Hang in there.

163
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,267
Yuki, hang in there.

164
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,633
Hang in there, Yuki.

165
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:08,967
No, she's not answering.

166
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,900
Maybe it's hard to get through
at a hospital.

167
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,767
Don't you know where
the cafe is?

168
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,067
I think she said it was in
Daikanyama.

169
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,867
I see. I'll go around cafes.

170
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,400
Can you do it by yourself?

171
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,867
Daikanyama is small enough.
You guys contact Matsumoto.

172
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,567
Roger.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,500
-Careful on your steps.
-Yes. Hurry, hurry.

174
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,733
You go that way. I go this way.

175
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,033
Irie is coming soon.

176
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
You'll be okay.

177
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40,667
Brother.

178
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,733
You're okay. Don't worry.

179
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll take Irie no matter what.

180
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,133
Wait for me, Kotoko.

181
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,533
Excuse me.

182
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,733
Yes.

183
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,767
Excuse me.

184
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
It's a hair salon Matsuya.

185
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,667
Sorry.

186
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,133
Irie is not here today.

187
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,933
Then do you know Irie's address?

188
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,100
Well...

189
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,100
I don't have it.

190
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,367
Okay...

191
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,267
you don't know it.

192
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Then tell us the cafe's name.

193
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,100
The cafe where Irie works.

194
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,533
Royal Garden Cafe on 2-chome.

195
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,133
The manager might know Irie's

196
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,933
emergency contact number.

197
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,300
Thank you so much.

198
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,100
It's in 2-chome.

199
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,467
-Royal...
-Royal Garden Cafe.

200
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,100
Royal Garden Cafe. Okay.

201
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,533
How is it? Did you find Irie?

202
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,933
<i>He wasn't at Matsumoto's.</i>

203
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,667
<i>She doesn't know</i>
<i>where Irie lives.</i>

204
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,500
<i>The name of the cafe is</i>
<i>Royal Garden Cafe.</i>

205
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,600
<i>She doesn't know</i>
<i>if he is working there tonight.</i>

206
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,600
<i>His shift is random.</i>

207
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,400
I'll go to the cafe for now.
They might know

208
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,067
Irie's contact number.

209
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:42,300
<i>Got it. Is there anything else</i>
<i>that we can do?</i>

210
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,700
No, that's enough. It was
a big help. Thank you.

211
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,400
<i>Say hi to Kotoko.</i>

212
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,167
<i>Tell Kotoko to hang in there.</i>

213
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,467
Got it.

214
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,600
It's probably Intussusception.

215
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,000
Intuss. what is it?

216
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
It's a kind of
intestinal obstruction.

217
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,500
It's not like he's in critical
condition right now,

218
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,267
but if you leave it alone
it can be fatal.

219
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,700
Fatal?

220
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:15,967
No way.

221
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,667
It's better to operate on him
as soon as possible.

222
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,400
Then please...

223
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,600
operate right now.

224
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,133
Please save Yuki.

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,533
May I ask if you're his family?

226
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,467
-No.
-At this hospital,

227
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,800
we need consent
from a family member

228
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,933
to operate on a minor.

229
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,933
Well, but now...

230
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,267
his parents are on vacation.

231
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,067
Can you contact
other family members?

232
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,700
We need a consent form in case
anything happens.

233
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,300
What am I going to do?

234
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,067
Irie.

235
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,100
Brother.

236
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:21,467
Where is it?

237
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:24,667
ROYAL GARDEN CAFE

238
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,867
Here it is. Naoki Irie is here.

239
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,767
Naoki Irie.

240
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,433
What are you yelling about?

241
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,433
You come with me.

242
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,367
Your brother is sick.

243
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,600
He's at Takao Hospital with Kotoko.

244
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,133
-Sorry, I got to go.
-Okay.

245
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,000
Sorry. Sorry.

246
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,700
Taxi!

247
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,567
Hi, Takao Hospital, please.

248
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,300
Irie.

249
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,433
Come soon.

250
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,800
Irie.

251
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,467
Excuse me, where's Yuki Irie?

252
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:41,200
Irie. Good.

253
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,467
Yuki needs an operation.

254
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,967
He needs a consent from family.

255
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:47,800
I've signed the consent.
Everything will be okay.

256
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,133
You'll be okay.
Sorry to have you wait.

257
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,600
Am I going to die?

258
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:00,667
No, you don't. It's an easy
operation. It'll be done soon.

259
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,000
Hang in there.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,100
We're ready now. We'll take him
to the operation room.

261
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,233
OPERATION ROOM
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

262
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,467
Family members can wait here

263
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,367
until the operation is over.

264
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,633
Okay.

265
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,533
Thank you so much.

266
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:46,400
Kotoko must be relieved.

267
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,633
I'm going now.

268
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,333
Chef is not here today
and Mr. Odawara is all by himself.

269
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,900
He must be busy.

270
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,233
Thank you so much.

271
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,800
Please send my best regards
to Mr. Odawara.

272
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,233
Yeah.

273
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,133
I'm relieved
that It didn't get serious.

274
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:06,800
See you.

275
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,833
Ikezawa.

276
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,633
Thank you.

277
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,867
Aren't you being too selfish?

278
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,533
I don't care if you live
by yourself,

279
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,733
but give your family
your contact number.

280
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:44,000
What if anything happens to Yuki
because of that?

281
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,867
I, too, left Osaka
to come to Tokyo by myself.

282
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,000
For you wanting to be
by yourself...

283
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,000
must have a good reason.

284
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,567
But if anything happens
because of that,

285
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:00,500
you and the people around you

286
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:04,200
will suffer.
It's too late if it happens.

287
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,433
People can't live alone.

288
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:15,367
Your feelings and
what you think

289
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:19,600
should be told to the people
around you.

290
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:28,500
Kotoko, see you later.

291
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,167
Thank you again.

292
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:51,667
Irie.

293
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,567
Now I remember.
I forgot to call Mrs. Irie.

294
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,267
Oh, no.

295
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,900
I got lots of missed calls.

296
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,867
It's inside the hospital here.

297
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,200
Right.

298
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:47,167
TAKAO HOSPITAL

299
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,433
<i>I finally got through. Kotoko!</i>

300
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,367
Mrs. Irie, listen.

301
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,767
Yuki had to have
an emergency operation.

302
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,033
-<i>Operation?</i>
-It's a kind of

303
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,700
intestinal obstruction.

304
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,700
He was able to get operated
as soon as he had symptoms

305
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,167
so it won't get serious.

306
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,600
The operation will be over soon.

307
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,067
Irie came here

308
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,833
and he's staying with Yuki.

309
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,633
<i>Anyhow,</i>

310
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,333
<i>we'll be back soon.</i>

311
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,233
Coming back soon?
You're in Kyushu, though.

312
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,100
There's no more airplanes
nor bullet trains today.

313
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,967
Tokyo, please.

314
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,067
<i>Where are you now?</i>

315
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't worry about us.

316
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,500
No matter what,

317
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:42,933
we'll get back to Tokyo
for sure.

318
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,433
Tokyo please.

319
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,667
-<i>Until I come home, take care</i>
-Okay. You, too.

320
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,600
-<i>of Yuki.</i>
-Come home safely.

321
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,900
-Yes.
-<i>Koto--</i>

322
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,467
Hello. Hello...?

323
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,233
Thank you, Kotoko.

324
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,967
I was scared.

325
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,667
I was scared.

326
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,667
Irie, I was scared.

327
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,833
You're okay now.

328
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:47,533
I was scared, Irie.

329
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,267
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

330
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,400
The operation was successful.

331
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,567
He can move to the general ward
tomorrow.

332
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:05,233
Family members
should go home tonight.

333
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
However...

334
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,400
No one can stay at ICU.

335
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,700
There's no facility for you
to stay overnight.

336
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,400
You can come back
tomorrow morning.

337
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
I see.

338
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:21,267
Thank you so much, doctor.

339
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,500
Anyway, that lady made
a quick decision

340
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:29,000
to take him to the hospital.
That was great.

341
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,933
It doesn't get serious
when it's found early,

342
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,567
but many people think it's just a
stomachache and have them endure it.

343
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,533
It's a curable disease,

344
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,800
but sometimes it can be fatal.

345
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,500
Especially for young children.

346
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,633
Your brother was lucky.

347
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,167
You should thank that lady.

348
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,300
How was it?

349
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,000
He's okay now.

350
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,933
He can move to the general
ward tomorrow.

351
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,967
I'll stay with Yuki then.

352
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,367
You can't do it.

353
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,467
-But...
-Let's leave it to professionals.

354
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,933
Yuki will be hospitalized
from tomorrow and on.

355
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,933
You should rest for a while.

356
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's go. I'll take you home.

357
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:34,800
TAKAO HOSPITAL

358
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,467
Oh, wow. It's snowing.

359
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,433
It was very cold tonight.

360
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,433
The trains are not running now.

361
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,900
It may be hard to catch a taxi.

362
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,533
What can I do?

363
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,767
You're right. No cars are running.

364
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,900
-Do you want to come to my condo?
-What?

365
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,633
It's about a ten-minute walk
from here.

366
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,267
How about an umbrella?

367
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,000
Umbrella. Umbrella?

368
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:45,500
Come in.

369
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,400
Excuse me.

370
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,167
Don't look around.

371
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:07,400
<i>This is the room that Irie lives.</i>

372
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,400
<i>Right now, I'm in Irie's room</i>

373
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,867
<i>all by ourselves.</i>

374
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:36,900
In this room.

375
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,733
Did Matsumoto come here?

376
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,167
No.

377
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,300
You're the first one.

378
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,500
You must've been cold.

379
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:58,900
Do you want to take a shower?

380
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
You go ahead.

381
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,400
I can go later.

382
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,900
Well, this is your place.

383
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:15,133
I have to tell Mrs. Irie

384
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,067
that the operation was successful.

385
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:21,633
I have to tell her that I can't
stay with Yuki tonight

386
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,300
or they'll go
directly to the hospital.

387
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:26,500
So you go ahead.

388
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:58,033
<i>He's taking a shower</i>

389
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:02,233
<i>and the night with just two of us</i>
<i>is about to begin.</i>

390
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:07,367
<i>There was one time like that</i>
<i>at the Irie residence,</i>

391
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,800
<i>but it's different this time.</i>

392
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:11,533
<i>Because this room has...</i>

393
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>...only one bed.</i>

394
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,733
What am I thinking in this crisis?

395
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,233
I'm done.

396
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,367
Change of clothes.

397
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,433
These are mine, but...

398
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,033
Thank you.

399
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:58,567
Then...

400
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,700
I'm taking a shower now.

401
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,467
See you.

402
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:37,667
Irie's shampoo.

403
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,767
The soap that Irie used.

404
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,433
Yes, yes.

405
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,767
The towels are right there.

406
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:52,567
Yes.

407
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,967
Irie's towel.

408
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:35,133
Thank you for the shower.

409
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,167
Sure.

410
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,900
I'm going to bed now.

411
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
Right. I'll sleep around here.

412
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,833
You use your bed.

413
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,600
-Of course I will.
-What?

414
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:59,233
Usually you say to a girl

415
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,500
"What are you talking about?
I'll sleep here.

416
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,433
You use my bed."
or something like that.

417
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm just kidding.

418
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,500
You can use my bed.

419
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,733
Well, but, that

420
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
makes me feel guilty.

421
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:18,600
You started saying that.
What do you want?

422
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,900
Just go to bed.

423
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,833
Well, but...

424
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,500
Good night.

425
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,867
Yes.

426
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm turning the lights off.

427
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:32,167
Ye-- yes.

428
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,133
Hey.

429
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,267
What?

430
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:26,767
Can you turn a small light on?

431
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,867
I can't sleep unless it's
completely dark.

432
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,933
But I can't go to the bathroom
like this.

433
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,833
Seriously?

434
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,200
Is this good?

435
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,833
Sorry. Thank you.

436
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,367
Good night, then.

437
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,133
Hey.

438
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
What now?

439
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,233
Irie, aren't you cold?

440
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,333
Of course I'm cold.

441
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,800
I'll go on the floor.

442
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,933
This is your place.

443
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,233
It's okay. Just go to bed.

444
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,400
But I feel guilty.

445
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:08,967
I don't want you to be cold.

446
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,300
Got it.

447
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:13,967
Wil you be satisfied if I go there?

448
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,733
I'll go on the floor.

449
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,900
It's okay. You'll be quiet
when I do this.

450
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,000
Good night.

451
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:14,267
<i>What am I hoping for</i>

452
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:17,167
<i>when Yuki is in</i>
<i>a serious condition?</i>

453
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,233
<i>Of course.</i>

454
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,167
Good night.

455
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:30,167
<i>But he's in the same bed</i>
<i>with a girl,</i>

456
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,167
<i>but he doesn't do anything.</i>

457
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,900
<i>I wonder if I just don't have</i>
<i>enough appeal</i>

458
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:38,867
<i>as a woman.</i>

459
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,800
<i>That's right. That makes sense.</i>

460
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:52,933
Are you disappointed?

461
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,767
Since I don't do anything to you...

462
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,000
you're disappointed, aren't you?

463
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,267
I'm not disappointed.

464
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:11,500
I...

465
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,833
don't want to do as
the way my mom wants.

466
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:22,500
If my mom comes to know that
you stayed here tonight,

467
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,900
and if anything happens to us,
then...

468
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,567
I'll play into her hands.

469
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,167
Then, for the rest of my life,

470
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,267
I'll be her puppet.

471
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,933
Kotoko-chan, you stayed at

472
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,867
Naoki's place? Wow!

473
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,267
I kind of understand.

474
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,867
That's why I didn't

475
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:50,067
tell my family this address.

476
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,133
Is that right?

477
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:57,700
My mom is like that, right?

478
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,900
If I give her my address,

479
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,633
she'd make a spare key
and come here every day.

480
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,900
She'll cook three meals
and leave them for me.

481
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,933
That'll ruin the whole point
of living by myself.

482
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,167
The point of living by yourself?

483
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:16,967
I stay home forever,

484
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:18,867
graduate college,

485
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,300
then take over my dad's business.

486
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:24,567
I wondered if it would be
really okay being just like that.

487
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,800
That's just living on the rails
that my parents laid.

488
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,100
If it's what I really want to do,
it will be okay, but...

489
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,467
I still don't know yet.

490
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,233
So, to find what I really wanted,

491
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I wanted to live on my own.

492
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,167
I remember.

493
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
You were saying that
in Odaiba.

494
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,700
Compared to the life without
any hardship,

495
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:07,467
it's more fun to face the
challenge. You realized it.

496
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:11,000
Right.

497
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,100
Then,

498
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:15,067
the reason you started living by yourself

499
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,833
is not because you wanted
to avoid me.

500
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,900
Why do I have to

501
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,433
go through hard time
just for that?

502
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,900
Living by myself is not that easy.

503
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,800
Up until now at home...

504
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,733
how spoiled I was!

505
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,500
I was forced to realize that.

506
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,967
I see.

507
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:45,800
But...

508
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,900
because of that,
things like this happened.

509
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,933
I've been

510
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,600
caused troubles by you,

511
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,567
but I was the one
who caused trouble to you today.

512
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:08,800
That's...

513
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,500
I...

514
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,767
can only do things like that.

515
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,167
Since you're a genius,
you can do anything, but...

516
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:37,533
I thought about it
at the hospital today.

517
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,533
Human life

518
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,300
is dependent upon a moment's
decision.

519
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,500
The little thing leads

520
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,800
easily curable to incurable.

521
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:54,367
Just like that,

522
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,600
human life is so fragile.

523
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,300
<i>Even if it's curable,</i>

524
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:03,267
<i>sometimes it becomes fatal.</i>

525
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,067
<i>Especially for young children.</i>

526
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:08,933
<i>In this case also, if she would've</i>
<i>waited until morning...</i>

527
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,200
I was scared, too.

528
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,667
Until now,
I thought that life was

529
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,900
decided by God...

530
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,967
and humans could do
nothing about it.

531
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,567
If it's you, you can make
things happen.

532
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,133
Developing new medicines

533
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,967
and becoming a doctor

534
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,133
and cure diseases like magic.

535
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,333
You have

536
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,933
lots of possibilities.

537
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,700
In order to find your possibility,

538
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,933
you started
living by yourself, right?

539
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:57,067
No matter how many possibilities
I have,

540
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:00,267
if I don't know what I want to do,

541
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,167
it's meaningless.

542
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:07,533
It's been easy no matter what I did.

543
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:10,933
In other words, I was bored.

544
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:15,033
Once I got to be busy,

545
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,300
the important thing for me

546
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:20,733
and my interests became visible.

547
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,867
Little by little,

548
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,300
I started to realize
what they are.

549
00:40:47,467 --> 00:40:49,633
You are always

550
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,900
like this when it's time for
something important.

551
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,333
<i>I'll go to Yuki's hospital.</i>

552
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,900
<i>Have some coffee if you like.</i>

553
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:52,600
<i>P.S. We talked a lot last night,</i>
<i>didn't we?</i>

554
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:54,000
<i>Thank you.</i>

555
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
<i>Kotoko.</i>

556
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:25,767
Kotoko.

557
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:27,600
We're home now.

558
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,533
Is she asleep?

559
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,567
She must be tired,
so don't wake her up.

560
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,933
Then I'll pack up things

561
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,067
to bring
to the hospital for Yuki.

562
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,167
Honey, honey, come.

563
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,633
Come with me.

564
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,967
What?

565
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:55,933
Honey, over here.

566
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,833
See? These.

567
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,767
See? Over here too.

568
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,900
It looks like it's just
as they left.

569
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,867
Kotoko is not in her room.

570
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,200
She may have not come back here.

571
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:14,300
Where's Kotoko then?

572
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:16,800
But...

573
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:20,100
she said she was okay
on the phone.

574
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,033
She could have been

575
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,733
at Naoki's house.

576
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,300
-No way.
-No way.

577
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:34,933
It's possible.

578
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,867
Since they were in
an extreme condition,

579
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:39,800
they finally

580
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:43,400
realized their feelings towards
each other. Wow!

581
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Your brother is doing well.

582
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,167
Is that right?

583
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,233
She came first in the morning

584
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,200
and did this and that.

585
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:02,100
He seemed to be relieved.

586
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,067
Oh, my.

587
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,167
They got tired.

588
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,733
Let's not wake them up.

589
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
Isn't your girlfriend cute?

590
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:24,200
I was once like her.

591
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,367
Take your time.

592
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,533
Thank you.

593
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:41,033
GET WELL SOON

594
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,000
Irie.

595
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,900
Yuki is asleep, isn't he?

596
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:28,467
It feels like it was a dream
that he was suffering last night.

597
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:33,867
The doctor said that he'd be
able to be discharged soon.

598
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,867
Okay.

599
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:41,900
Can you come with me?

600
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,167
It feels good.

601
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,767
Hey...

602
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,633
You say

603
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:04,100
you like me and all that,

604
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:07,233
but do you know

605
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,167
how I feel?

606
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:12,767
Your feelings are

607
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:16,000
that you don't care about me
at all and...

608
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,700
Silly.

609
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:24,933
You're wrong.

610
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:30,733
The second time.

611
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,600
Oh, well.

612
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:38,433
It was a dream.

613
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,733
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

614
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:44,933
What's wrong, Yuki?

615
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,733
Your face is red.
Do you have fever again?

616
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,867
I'm okay. Don't bother me.

617
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:54,033
-Sorry.
-Anyway,

618
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,500
that one.

619
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,633
What's this?

620
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,267
My brother brought it

621
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:01,500
while you're asleep.

622
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:02,933
Really?

623
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,800
He should have woke me up.

624
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,367
He left soon to go to college.

625
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,100
Okay.

626
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:12,000
Wow, it's beautiful.

627
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,833
I'll put these in a vase.

628
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,200
It was not a dream, I guess.

629
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,233
Bro.

630
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:36,167
Here they are.

631
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,533
Look at these flowers.
They're so beautiful.

632
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,600
That's just like Irie.

633
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:43,300
He has good taste.

634
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,400
It smells good.

635
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,900
Oh, I know.
I bought underwear for you.

636
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,933
Antibacterial and deodorant.

637
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:58,067
It comes with a label that you can
write your name on.

638
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:00,467
Do you write your name
on your underwear?

639
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:33,500
Well, I'm going to the party, too.

640
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,600
-I love Christmas.
-On Christmas Eve

641
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,400
we'll have a party.

642
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:39,867
I heard that you couldn't go.

643
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:42,067
You spend Christmas
with your girlfriends, right?

644
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:44,600
-Boyfriend.
-When did you both...

645
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:47,267
Kotoko is being left over.

646
00:50:47,433 --> 00:50:50,333
I'm fine if I can't spend time
with Irie.

647
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,833
I heard that there were
thieves around here.

648
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,233
{\an8}-It's serious!
-You bastard, bastard, bastard!

649
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,533
