1
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,667
Now...

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,800
Naoki Irie and Sahoko Oizumi's

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:11,067
engagement is arranged.
I'm happy for it.

4
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:14,067
I respectfully accept it.

5
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:17,067
I will keep this promise forever.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,800
Miss Kotoko Aihara.

7
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,067
Will you marry me?

8
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,533
You were proposed to by Kin-chan?

9
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,567
Come this way.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,267
Sit down here.

11
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:47,533
So, what did you tell him?

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,233
I haven't said anything, yet.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,200
What are you going to tell him?

14
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,733
I... I don't know.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,100
I like Kin-chan a lot,

16
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:03,967
but we've been friends.

17
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,933
I understand.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,667
I think for you,

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,767
Kin-chan suits better than Irie.
To be honest.

20
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,200
-Satomi.
-Think about it.

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,900
Irie has been suggestive to you

22
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,700
and he even kissed you.

23
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,433
Then he engaged
with a different girl easily.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,267
Being your best friend,
I can't forgive him.

25
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:28,167
Right. During all that,

26
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,867
Kin-chan has been

27
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,800
in love with only Kotoko
the whole time.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,733
You've said that

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,000
when you're with Kin-chan,

30
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,233
you have fun.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,067
I get that you admire Irie

32
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,000
who has something
that you don't have,

33
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:48,400
but the person you can stay
together with longer,

34
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,533
the person who makes you happy
for the rest of your life,

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,567
is a guy like Kin-chan.

36
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,633
That's what I think.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,400
It makes women happier
to be loved than to love.

38
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,600
Take this chance

39
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:05,100
to consider Kin-chan seriously.

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,667
Here's the sake for you.

41
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,400
All right.

42
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,967
You're cheerful as always.

43
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,033
Thank you.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,233
I wish a cheerful guy like you

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,433
were in my restaurant.

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,800
-No, no.
-I own

47
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:32,067
a Japanese restaurant.

48
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,767
-Where?
-I'm not telling you.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,167
-Tell me.
-Do you want to know?

50
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:41,267
<i>If Irie learns that I was proposed to</i>
<i>by Kin-chan,</i>

51
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:45,133
<i>what would he think?</i>

52
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,633
<i>Would Irie</i>

53
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:51,500
<i>be surprised even a little bit?</i>

54
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>Or...</i>

55
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:59,633
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

56
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,033
{\an8}You've decided to contribute

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
{\an8}to us in a great amount.

58
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:06,367
{\an8}Thank you so much.

59
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,633
{\an8}MIRACLE OF A SHOOTING STAR

60
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,100
{\an8}Stop being so formal.

61
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,967
We'll be a family soon.

62
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,267
Let's help out each other.

63
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,500
Thank you so much.

64
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:22,033
So, what will be
the day of wedding?

65
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,967
-Please decide as you wish.
-Okay.

66
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,933
Chairman.

67
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,600
Actually, my father will

68
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,533
be having heart surgery
this year.

69
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,400
Naoki.

70
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,100
You told us that we'd become
a family.

71
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:41,767
So I don't want to hide anything.

72
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,967
Naoki.

73
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,100
What a guy.

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,700
Therefore,

75
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:51,567
I'd like the wedding to be after
the surgery,

76
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:55,700
next year, if possible.

77
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,233
I see.

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,767
It's my precious Sahoko's wedding.

79
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,867
We might need that much time
to prepare.

80
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:08,600
It's the June bride, isn't it?

81
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,267
Then it'll be around this time
next year.

82
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,633
-I see.
-Okay.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,300
Does he still have time?

84
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,400
Chairman, your next appointment
is getting close.

85
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,567
Oh, all right.

86
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,467
See you then.

87
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,400
It's like a dream

88
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,833
to become family
with a guy like you.

89
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,667
Thank you.

90
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,567
We're home.

91
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,100
Welcome home.

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm tired.

93
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,933
You're not 100 percent, yet.

94
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,267
-You'd better rest now.
-Yeah.

95
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,733
Naoki.

96
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,333
Thank you.

97
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,533
But,

98
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:18,033
are you sure
it's okay with you?

99
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,267
You understood that when you
met Sahoko, don't you?

100
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,867
Why would I complain
when I get to marry a girl like her?

101
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,400
You're right.

102
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,500
Naoki is

103
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:47,100
really marrying that girl.

104
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,267
We can't go back anymore.

105
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,200
<i>Miss Kotoko Aihara.</i>

106
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,133
Will you marry me?

107
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,400
Marrying Kin-chan, huh?

108
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't picture myself.

109
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,733
-Yes.
-Kotoko, may I come in?

110
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,033
Yes.

111
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,633
What is it, Dad?

112
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,567
Kotoko.

113
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,167
Can you take a look at this?

114
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,333
-Is this the new house?
-Yeah.

115
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,000
How do you like it?

116
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,833
It's bigger than before.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,533
It's a little far from the station,
but the rent is reasonable.

118
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,967
Didn't you tell me that you
didn't like this kind?

119
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,433
You said you liked
a single-family home.

120
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:06,267
Owning a single-family home was
a promise that I made with your mom.

121
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:09,133
But it's impossible to get one
right now.

122
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,833
So we'll go with a rental for now.

123
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,800
If you marry a man,
I'll aim for owning

124
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,367
a two generation home with him.

125
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,433
Of course, if there's a guy

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,367
who wants to marry you.

127
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,633
Dad.

128
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,367
Will you be happy
if I marry Kin-chan?

129
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,400
Is anything going on
between you and him?

130
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,167
-I'm just asking.
-Oh.

131
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,333
Kinnosuke, huh?

132
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,033
Well, he sure is

133
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,600
talented when it comes to cooking.

134
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,233
He's warmhearted and caring.

135
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,433
So honest and sincere.

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,667
If he marries you,

137
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,767
I'll have a successor
for my restaurant.

138
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,367
I'll be happy about it.

139
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,167
I agree.

140
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,600
But you don't have to force yourself
to marry him.

141
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,900
Your feelings are the most important
thing to me.

142
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,633
If you love this man the most

143
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,300
and he'll make you happy,

144
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,867
then the restaurant
has nothing to do with it.

145
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,433
Don't turn around yet.

146
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,033
-After you get up there.
-Okay.

147
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,233
Not yet.

148
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,833
-Not yet.
-Yes.

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,833
Here we come.
Here we come.

150
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,033
One, two, three, ta-da!

151
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,100
Amazing.

152
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,267
Kotoko, look.

153
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,367
It's so beautiful.

154
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,500
How about that, Kotoko?
Let's go.

155
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,133
I know the best seat.

156
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,167
The special seat for you.

157
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,133
There, there.

158
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:24,200
There, there. This way, this way.

159
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,133
See?

160
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,000
How about this?

161
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,400
Take a look.

162
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,600
How do you like it?

163
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,633
It's huge.

164
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,433
It's so cool.

165
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,067
It's impossible to block this.

166
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,233
<i>I'm</i>

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
telling you that I don't mind

168
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,067
being in the same house with you.

169
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,100
Does that mean that

170
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,700
you don't

171
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:57,167
hate me?

172
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:59,667
You're hard to deal with,

173
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,700
but I don't hate you.

174
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,633
Kotoko.

175
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,233
Rainbow Bridge is over there.

176
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,267
Hey, Kotoko.

177
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,233
Kotoko.

178
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,200
Sorry, nothing.

179
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,333
I know. You must be hungry.

180
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,033
Shall we go eat something
before we go play?

181
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,200
When you're hungry,

182
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:35,600
you can't fight the battle. Right?

183
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:37,867
You're right. Let's go.

184
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,600
-Let's go then.
-Yeah.

185
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,333
Rainbow Bridge looks nice.

186
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,800
What's wrong, Kotoko?

187
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,633
That's Irie.

188
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,500
That's okay.

189
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,467
Is the girl next to him his fiancé?

190
00:12:56,633 --> 00:13:01,500
She looks so much like
a high-class girl.

191
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:05,367
Is this Kotoko?

192
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,533
Oh, Sahoko. Nice to see you again.

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,233
What a coincidence.
Are you on a date too?

194
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,867
She's my fiancé, Sahoko Oizumi.

195
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,467
How do you do?
I'm Sahoko Oizumi.

196
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,600
Nice to meet you.

197
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,200
Nice to meet you.

198
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,367
I'm Kinnosuke Ikezawa.

199
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,700
I'm a cook at Kotoko's dad's
restaurant.

200
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,967
Wow, you're the successor
of her father.

201
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:37,033
No, no. I'm still in training.

202
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,167
What made you come here?

203
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:43,100
Actually, we're going to an art
exhibition in Ginza.

204
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:46,733
But Naoki suggested to stop by here
before that.

205
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
He said that there was
a great place.

206
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:53,100
You said that you wanted to go
to a place that had an open feel.

207
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,567
<i>This is the place</i>
<i>that he came with me.</i>

208
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,133
<i>He takes Sahoko here.</i>

209
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,500
<i>For Irie,</i>

210
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:07,300
<i>the first date with me</i>
<i>was nothing.</i>

211
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:10,200
<i>It was something</i>
<i>that he didn't care about.</i>

212
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:13,000
Right. If you don't mind it,

213
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,500
Kotoko and Kinnosuke
should come with us.

214
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,167
Francis Bacon's
early works will be...

215
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,833
-Be... Bacon?
-Be... What?

216
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,400
We'd rather have

217
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,467
sausage than bacon.

218
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,533
You shouldn't force them, Sahoko.

219
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,933
Even if you invite them there,

220
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,800
it'll be painful for them.

221
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,567
They have their

222
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:42,333
-own level.
-Wow.

223
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:46,567
Level? What do you mean, Irie?

224
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:50,100
Right. Do you want to tell us
that we're stupid?

225
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,500
Am I wrong?

226
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,267
Naoki?

227
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,933
Let's go, Kin-chan.

228
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,033
Let's do something
that suits our level.

229
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,133
Kotoko.

230
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,233
Sahoko, please enjoy bacon
by yourselves.

231
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,567
We'll eat sausages until we're full.
Excuse me now.

232
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,167
Kotoko.

233
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,033
What a great couple

234
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,467
you guys are.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,433
Thanks a lot.

236
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,200
What's wrong, Naoki?

237
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,700
Saying harsh words like that
to Kotoko

238
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,433
is unlike you.

239
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Is it unlike me?

240
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
Don't worry.

241
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:47,400
I won't say stuff like that to you.

242
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,667
Sahoko?

243
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,633
Naoki, you're

244
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,567
good at your job

245
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,367
and you know everything,

246
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:05,833
but you don't know
your true feelings.

247
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,933
I'm going home today.

248
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,500
It's so irritating.

249
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,333
Are you okay?

250
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,767
-About what?
-I mean...

251
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,433
About what?

252
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
Nothing.

253
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,600
Eat a lot of sausages.

254
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,167
I guess you're eating them already.

255
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,933
-Ai-chan.
-Mr. Aihara.

256
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,233
Are you sure you're moving out?

257
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,433
Yes.

258
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,300
We don't mind it at all.

259
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,767
No, no.

260
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,200
Naoki is getting married.

261
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,700
It's about time.

262
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,200
Everything is going to be over.

263
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:38,800
AIHARA

264
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,767
Good job, guys.

265
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:45,967
Thank you.

266
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,667
I'm visiting this regular customer.

267
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,500
-Take care of the rest of it.
-Yes.

268
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,000
See you later.

269
00:17:56,067 --> 00:18:00,833
Tomorrow is the day off.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,567
I've worked hard this week.

271
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:04,933
-Bro.
-Yeah.

272
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
We'll do the rest of it.

273
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,567
You can go home now.

274
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,433
Are you sure?

275
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,967
I'll be leaving then.

276
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,900
Have a nice night.

277
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,900
Have a nice night.

278
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,900
You've worked hard this week.

279
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,467
Yeah.

280
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:27,900
Hey, Kotoko.

281
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,467
-Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
-No.

282
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:33,067
I don't have any.
Do you want to go out?

283
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,367
No.

284
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,333
Why don't we have a study
meeting here?

285
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,767
Study meeting?

286
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,200
You must be getting
used to it here,

287
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,533
but you don't know the basics
of Japanese cuisine and things, yet.

288
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
I want to start making

289
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:49,700
a full course meal plan by myself.

290
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,333
As you taste test my food,

291
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,733
we can study about it together.

292
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,567
Sounds good. Let's do it.

293
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,633
Good idea, isn't it?
Okay, let's do it.

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
Sure.

295
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,967
-I'm home.
-Oh, Naoki.

296
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,967
You are late tonight.

297
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,467
But

298
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:23,933
Kotoko is not home, yet.

299
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,433
Is that right?

300
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,700
I wonder if she's cleaning up
at the restaurant.

301
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,900
She's been late these days. No.

302
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,200
She's later than usual today.

303
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,767
Maybe she's going out with

304
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,633
Kin-chan some place.

305
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,833
Possibly

306
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,567
she may not come home tonight.

307
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,567
Good night.

308
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,700
Hey, Naoki.

309
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,800
The Aiharas are

310
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:56,500
moving out of here.

311
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,167
Are you sure

312
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,533
it's okay with you?

313
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,667
Aihara said she'd be missing
practice today.

314
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,067
Is that right?

315
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,633
Even though you live in the
same house, you don't know

316
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,667
anything about each other.

317
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm busy at work

318
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,233
and I'm going home late every day.

319
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,833
See you later.

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,933
Hey, Irie.

321
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,900
I heard that you were getting
married. Congratulations.

322
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,667
Thank you.

323
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,733
Long time no see.

324
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,167
-How are you?
-Good.

325
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,400
Even though you broke my heart,

326
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,767
I'm doing well, as you see.

327
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,600
Are you going to quit school?

328
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:28,933
Probably.

329
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:37,533
I don't like her.

330
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:41,200
A girl who can't complain
is boring.

331
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,467
It's just like you.

332
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,800
If you become somebody
else's man,

333
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,533
stay as a cool Irie yourself.

334
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,533
See you then.

335
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,533
Naoki Irie. Why are you here?

336
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,567
Is it bad for me to come here?

337
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:34,633
I'm taking a leave of absence,
but I'm still registered here.

338
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,500
Well, Kotoko is not here today.

339
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,933
Too bad for you.

340
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,067
I didn't ask you that.

341
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:46,167
She'll be at the restaurant
by now.

342
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,400
Restaurant? Isn't it closed today?

343
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,900
Wow, you know well.

344
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,300
But on that day off

345
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:56,533
she purposely goes there

346
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,833
and studies together with Kin-chan.

347
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,467
Studying together?

348
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,367
That's more like an excuse

349
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:08,667
and Kotoko is trying to answer
to Kin-chan's proposal.

350
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,367
Proposal?

351
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,300
You didn't know that?

352
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,500
Kin-chan proposed

353
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,333
-to Kotoko.
-Jinko!

354
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,033
Let me say it.

355
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,033
Someone is
marrying for political reasons

356
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,133
with this high-class girl.

357
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,867
Kotoko was depressed
in the beginning.

358
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:29,833
But later, she found

359
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,900
a true love.

360
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,933
-Right, Satomi?
-What?

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,667
Right. Right.

362
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:43,433
Money, social standings,

363
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,667
or a title has nothing to do with.

364
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,633
It's true love for her.

365
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,867
Right.

366
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,867
We're going on a date now.

367
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,267
Excuse us, now.

368
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:00,233
Going on a date with my true love
makes me

369
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,333
so happy,
even if it's a low budget one.

370
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,600
Right.

371
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,467
-Excuse us.
-Good bye.

372
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:24,433
-Feels so good!
-Jinko, your leg.

373
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,767
I'm feeling so good.

374
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,167
But Kotoko

375
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,700
never said that she'd answer
his proposal.

376
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,200
Was it okay to tell him
that kind of made-up story?

377
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,633
Because I was frustrated
that I had to say that.

378
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,900
It'll be a good opportunity
for that cold-hearted guy.

379
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:43,700
You're right.

380
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,600
You're right about it.

381
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,967
I feel so good.

382
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,633
There.

383
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,000
Beautiful.

384
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:00,733
It doesn't look like potato stew.

385
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,667
Japanese cuisine is not only
for your tongue,

386
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,900
but also for your eyes.

387
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:09,633
It's important to arrange it
beautifully.

388
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:13,267
Please try it.

389
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:16,667
Yes. Thank you for the meal.

390
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:22,000
Potato.

391
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,667
It's the first time for me to eat
a potato stew this good.

392
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,267
Isn't it good?

393
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,567
Sophisticated Kaiseki
is good,

394
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:39,900
but I want to cook

395
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:42,200
a homemade meal
that everybody knows.

396
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,733
Potato stew, Kinpira,

397
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,433
and fried tofu.

398
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,633
I want to open a restaurant
that serves that kind of food.

399
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,233
I think people's sense of taste
is rooted at home.

400
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,167
Using the best ingredients

401
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,467
and making the best homemade meal.

402
00:25:57,633 --> 00:26:00,433
I want people to know
the wonder of it.

403
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,933
I want to make it a homely
atmosphere.

404
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,933
A kind hostess is there

405
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,833
who everyone loves.

406
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
We run the restaurant together.

407
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,467
Kin-chan.

408
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,200
Listen, Kotoko.

409
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,200
Your answer from the other day,

410
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,767
can you give me it now?

411
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,333
Sorry.

412
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,533
Can you give me a little more time
to think about it?

413
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,767
You can't forget about Irie,
can you?

414
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,800
-It's not that.
-Then what?

415
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,700
My feelings have been

416
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,800
towards you this whole time.

417
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:28,267
Can't you look to the future?

418
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,933
Why do you like such
cold-hearted guy?

419
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,133
-Kin-chan.
-I'll make you forget

420
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,733
that guy.

421
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,367
Stop! Irie!

422
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,233
Sorry, Kin-chan.

423
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,333
I see.

424
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,267
You still like

425
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,400
Irie.

426
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,667
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm so sorry.

428
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:10,267
Damn it!

429
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
<i>I'm the worst.</i>

430
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:40,133
<i>I made Kin-chan expect a lot.</i>

431
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:43,400
<i>I was being suggestive to him.</i>

432
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,000
<i>And the word that came out</i>
<i>of my mouth was</i>

433
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,700
<i>Irie's name.</i>

434
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,400
<i>I thought about it.</i>

435
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,300
<i>I was troubled about it.</i>

436
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,533
<i>Then I gave up on him.</i>

437
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,833
<i>After all</i>

438
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,033
<i>I still love Irie.</i>

439
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,733
I don't know

440
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,400
what to do anymore.

441
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,933
Hey.

442
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:55,367
Irie. Why?

443
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:56,767
I'm here to

444
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,067
pick you up.

445
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,167
Picking up?

446
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,067
Me?

447
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,800
Were you with him?

448
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,400
Who?

449
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,700
Ikezawa.

450
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:37,833
Right.

451
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:42,033
I heard that you were proposed to.

452
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,233
Right.

453
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,533
I'm quite popular, you know.

454
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,300
What did you tell him?

455
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,967
Whatever I told him

456
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,867
is none of your business.

457
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,033
You're

458
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,000
getting married with Sahoko.

459
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,900
You're right.

460
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,200
I'm

461
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,833
moving out.

462
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,767
My dad and I have decided.

463
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,933
And then

464
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,433
I'll marry to Kin-chan.

465
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:46,733
Then I take over my dad's
restaurant

466
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,433
with Kin-chan.

467
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,967
Do you love him?

468
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,967
Kin-chan has been

469
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,533
liking me ever since we were
freshmen in high school.

470
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,300
Do you fall for the guy
if he says he likes you?

471
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,800
So what? Something wrong?

472
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,400
I've been in one-sided love
for many years

473
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,533
and got tired of not
being successful.

474
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,900
You just think about Sahoko.

475
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,400
Forget about me.

476
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,267
You love me.

477
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,333
You can't love

478
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,933
anyone else but me.

479
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:35,567
How come you're so confident?

480
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:38,300
Right. You're absolutely right.

481
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,033
I can't do much about it.

482
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,833
Because you don't like me.

483
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,533
You don't...

484
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,100
Don't you ever say that

485
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,733
you like somebody else but me.

486
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:14,333
This kiss is

487
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,333
the second time.

488
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,500
It's the third time, right?

489
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:23,533
What?

490
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't have to count anymore.

491
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,133
We'll miss you.

492
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,033
We'll come visit you.

493
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,800
They're home.

494
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:01,600
Naoki, Kotoko.

495
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:04,000
What made you so wet?

496
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:05,233
I'll bring towels.

497
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,533
No, I have something important
to tell you before that.

498
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,800
You stay here too, Mom.

499
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,200
Mr. Aihara, I have to talk to you.

500
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,867
You should change before that.

501
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,167
With Kotoko...

502
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,400
Please allow me to marry
your daughter.

503
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,833
Irie.

504
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:40,933
Are you serious, Naoki?

505
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,800
I am.

506
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,733
I've finally figured it out.

507
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,567
I want to

508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,600
marry Kotoko.

509
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:55,700
Of course it's not right now.

510
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:59,600
I have to have the Oizumis accept it.

511
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,333
When the company recovers

512
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,033
and the business goes back on track.

513
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
But

514
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,467
the person who I want to be with
for the rest of my life

515
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:17,533
is nobody else but her.
I can't think of anybody else.

516
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,167
Mr. Aihara.

517
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,100
Would you accept it?

518
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,500
Naoki.

519
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,433
She's a girl who can't do much.

520
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,567
I know.

521
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:44,500
She's not smart.

522
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,833
I know.

523
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,800
She can't cook.

524
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,267
I know.

525
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,267
She's careless,
jumps to conclusions,

526
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,967
and makes lots of mistakes.

527
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,233
I know.

528
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,367
However...

529
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:02,867
She's cheerful

530
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,500
and spirited.

531
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:11,633
She's earnest and very precious.

532
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,233
I know.

533
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,167
Naoki.

534
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,000
Please take good care

535
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,467
of Kotoko.

536
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,367
Yes.

537
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,500
Okay, Kotoko?

538
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,567
Yes.

539
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,967
Kotoko-chan!

540
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:47,367
How long have I been waiting
for this day!

541
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,833
Dad.

542
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,767
I'm sorry for being selfish.

543
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:58,800
This will make

544
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:02,600
it difficult for Chairman Oizumi
to contribute to Pandai.

545
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm causing a big loss.

546
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,600
You're right.

547
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,167
For Pandai, this is

548
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,933
a very serious issue.

549
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,400
Honey, leave that subject alone.

550
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:16,633
No, as a president of Pandai,

551
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:21,100
I can't allow this selfish act
of an employee.

552
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,433
Mr. Irie.

553
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Even so,

554
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,867
if you want to marry
Kotoko no matter what,

555
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,100
I have a condition.

556
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,833
You have to

557
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,933
quit Pandai.

558
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,167
Honey.

559
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:42,600
Then you go back to college

560
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,733
and study to become a doctor.

561
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,700
Dad.

562
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:55,300
Do you think you were hiding it
from me?

563
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:58,433
Don't underestimate your parent.

564
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,733
I've already known about it.

565
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,700
Pandai is

566
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,867
the company that I made.

567
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:09,900
I'll properly reestablish it.

568
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,800
I'll talk to Chairman Oizumi.

569
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,333
So you should

570
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,867
follow your dream.

571
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,100
Together with Kotoko.

572
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,600
Thank you.

573
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,500
Thank you so much.

574
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,100
But what's going to happen
to your company?

575
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,133
I'll do it.

576
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,900
I'll take over Dad's company.

577
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,000
It's going to take a while

578
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:01,233
so Dad has to work hard until then.

579
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,433
So you can be a doctor.

580
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,933
I'll do that then.

581
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,133
I'm counting on you, Yuki.

582
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:18,100
How wonderful. It's so great.

583
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,933
This will make everything

584
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,033
work out.

585
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
We'll

586
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,100
become a real family.

587
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,533
Anyways, you guys go change.

588
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,733
Right? Let's have a toast.

589
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,567
Get changed and let's have a toast.

590
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,833
I'm scared.

591
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,500
When tomorrow comes,

592
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,433
you might turn back

593
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,267
to old mean Irie.

594
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,800
Do you want to sleep
together then?

595
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,100
I didn't mean that.

596
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,433
Are you sure that I'm the one?

597
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:34,933
Yeah.

598
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:42,667
I love you, Irie.

599
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:46,133
I know.

600
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,133
More than enough.

601
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,367
But

602
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:56,867
I didn't know you liked me.

603
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,933
You got me.

604
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,300
I love you.

605
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,900
When is the closest Sunday
that's the most auspicious day?

606
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,833
Hey, Mom, are we there yet?

607
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,200
We're almost there.

608
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,433
Why do we have to go early
in the morning on Sunday?

609
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,900
Sorry, Ai-chan.

610
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,433
It's okay. I don't mind.

611
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,733
Anyway, Mrs. Irie,
where are we going?

612
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,833
Wedding.

613
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,700
What?

614
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,333
Over there.

615
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,133
It can't be.

616
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,600
Of course it's Naoki and Kotoko's.

617
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:18,967
What?

618
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:20,733
Hey, I didn't hear that.

619
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,267
Because

620
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:24,367
I didn't tell you.

621
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,867
Well, but

622
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,533
are we really having a wedding?

623
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,267
It's not, like, just looking?

624
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,767
It's the surprise present for you.

625
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,233
Ta-da!

626
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,767
Congratulations on your wedding.

627
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,933
Aren't you all surprised?

628
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,533
Okay, everyone, stop dozing

629
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,033
and go get dressed. Hurry up.

630
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,767
There you go.

631
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:21,300
I've never thought that this day
would come.

632
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,000
It's just like a dream.

633
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:31,867
Yuki.

634
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,433
-Fair feathers make fair fowls.
-What?

635
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,700
You don't know English
that's this easy?

636
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,533
You're stupid after all.

637
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,533
What does that fair something mean?

638
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:53,167
Fair feathers make fair fowls.

639
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,733
Beautiful feathers
make birds beautiful.

640
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,433
It means anybody will look decent

641
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,767
when wearing a beautiful dress.

642
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:06,067
You're making fun of me.

643
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,633
I'll tell you something good
as a wedding gift.

644
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,700
Come close.

645
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,300
You're looking sharp.

646
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:48,333
You're always perfect
when it comes to looking good.

647
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,633
Ikezawa.

648
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,567
Kotoko

649
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,700
is mine.

650
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:25,467
I would say

651
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:29,000
Kotoko has bad taste
in choosing a man.

652
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,267
Make Kotoko happy.

653
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:40,800
I won't forgive you if you
make her cry even for a little bit.

654
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:43,633
Yeah.

655
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:46,267
You can't let your guard down.

656
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,833
I'm always waiting for her.

657
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,800
Right.

658
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,567
I shook his hand.

659
00:48:43,933 --> 00:48:46,600
Come round, Naoki.

660
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:49,567
Right, Naoki.

661
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:54,033
-That's a good one.
-You look sharp, Naoki.

662
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,800
Being forced to do this

663
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:17,133
is irritating.

664
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,900
But you look beautiful,

665
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:25,833
so it doesn't matter.

666
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:36,300
Honor her, comfort her, and help her.

667
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,867
As long as you both shall live.

668
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:41,467
Keep yourself unto her.

669
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:42,967
The groom

670
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:46,833
may lift her veil.

671
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,100
Now, you may kiss your bride.

672
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:04,500
Hey, Irie.

673
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:08,033
You've been in love with me,
haven't you?

674
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,500
What?

675
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,267
Don't get carried away.

676
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:16,000
I heard about our second kiss.

677
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,533
Yuki told me secretly.

678
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,833
That rascal.

679
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,100
You've been crazy for me.

680
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:28,067
Oh, my God!

681
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,600
I've never seen an ideal Japanese
woman

682
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,533
like her before.

683
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,367
It serves you right.

684
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,100
I can't win

685
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,867
over you.

686
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,200
<i>This is how</i>

687
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:02,533
<i>I changed my name</i>
<i>from Kotoko Aihara</i>

688
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,300
<i>to Kotoko Irie.</i>

689
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,000
Congratulations.

690
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,633
Congratulations.

691
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,233
Congratulations.

692
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,333
Congratulations.

693
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,533
Congratulations.

694
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:23,800
{\an8}Is that a shooting star?
In this daylight?

695
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,567
{\an8}The possibility of a person getting
hit by a shooting star

696
00:52:26,633 --> 00:52:28,467
{\an8}is one in ten billion.

697
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,467
{\an8}Meeting you

698
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:34,100
{\an8}is a miracle even rarer than that.

699
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:43,900
{\an8}Try not to overwrap.

700
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,667
{\an8}Say cheese.

701
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:55,500
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
