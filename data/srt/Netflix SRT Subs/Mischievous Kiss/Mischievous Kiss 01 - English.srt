<i>Kiss in Tokyo.</i>

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,667
<i>It's time for "Kiss in Tokyo" again.</i>
<i>I'm the host Tama.</i>

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:20,067
<i>This show will be on air for four hours</i>
<i>until the morning. Enjoy it.</i>

4
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,933
<i>I went to see a fortuneteller</i>
<i>the other day.</i>

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,600
<i>I'm told that I have a good chance</i>
<i>for a new love. Yeah!</i>

6
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>But I may lose the opportunity,</i>
<i>because I tend to be too shy.</i>

7
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:37,567
<i>That's not good.</i>
<i>I need courage to confess my feeling.</i>

8
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,467
<i>But it's easier to say.</i>

9
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,300
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

10
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:45,233
<i>So tonight I want to hear</i>

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,933
<i>your story about love.</i>

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,633
<i>Hey, you. It's not time to yawn.</i>

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,067
<i>I want to hear funny stories</i>

14
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:58,133
<i>as well as heartwarming ones.</i>

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,100
<i>Don't hesitate. Send me your story.</i>

16
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:05,700
<i>The Lyra meteor stream</i>
<i>can be seen tonight.</i>

17
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:10,033
<i>This will be a rare opportunity</i>
<i>to see a meteor stream in Tokyo.</i>

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
The Lyra?

19
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,233
<i>I hope you know that</i>

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,900
<i>your dreams come true</i>
<i>when you wish upon a star.</i>

21
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,333
<i>If you have not confessed your love yet,</i>

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,733
<i>why don't you wish upon a star tonight?</i>

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,600
<i>It may help you get your love.</i>

24
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:39,133
I wish Irie to notice my feelings
and to love me back.

26
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,267
Good morning.

27
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,200
-Good morning.
-You are early today.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
I have to go. Talk to you later.

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,733
<i>Dear Mr. Naoki Irie,</i>

30
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,933
<i>how do you do?</i>

31
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:46,733
<i>I'm Kotoko Aihara of Class F.</i>

32
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:52,333
<i>You may not know me.</i>

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,367
<i>But I know you well.</i>

34
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,600
While I was walking to this school
with my mother,

35
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,400
I found beautiful cherry blossoms
and other spring flowers.

36
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,367
They seem to me--

37
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,433
<i>I have been in love with you</i>
<i>for two years</i>

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,667
<i>since I heard your speech</i>
<i>at the entrance ceremony.</i>

39
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:29,433
<i>Since I have no chance to be</i>
<i>in the same class with you,</i>

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,933
<i>I dare write a letter to tell you</i>
<i>my feeling.</i>

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,933
<i>I felt like struck by a shooting star</i>

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,800
<i>when I saw you for the first time.</i>

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,333
<i>This special feeling</i>
<i>has stayed in my heart.</i>

44
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,100
Excuse me.

45
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:14,833
Who are you?

46
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,667
I am Kotoko Aihara of Class F.

47
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,533
Well... could you please read this letter?

48
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,267
<i>Irie,</i>

49
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,767
<i>I love you.</i>

50
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,067
No, thank you.

51
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,933
<i>I thought that my first love ended</i>
<i>disastrously at that moment.</i>

52
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,100
I can't believe this.

53
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>But I didn't know that</i>

54
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,233
<i>miraculous events</i>
<i>were waiting for us.</i>

55
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,500

HIGH SCHOOL AFFILIATED

59
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,500
Look. It's Aihara of Class F.

60
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,733
I hear that she just confessed her love
to Irie of Class A.

61
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,933
Seriously?

62
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,400
-Kotoko Aihara confessed her love.
-Are you serious?

63
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,600
To Irie?

64
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,533
Aihara of Class F told Irie
of Class A that she loved him.

65
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,067
She should have known
that she had no chance.

66
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,667
Poor girl.

67
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,833
Enough.

68
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,967
Leave me alone.

69
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,700
Kotoko, did you really tell Irie
that you loved him?

70
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,600
Jinko, everyone can hear you.

71
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,367
How do you know that?

72
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,033
Handing a love letter at the gate?
It's so obvious.

73
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,933
Everyone knows it now.

74
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,333
I'm so embarrassed.

75
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,267
Why did you do that at the gate?
It's almost like a publicity stunt.

76
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,800
And why Irie?

77
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:52,300
I agree. You are reckless.
No doubt that he would reject you.

78
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,900
A miracle may happen.

79
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,300
By some chance, I thought he might

80
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,900
like me.

81
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:06,167
Come on. You are so naive.
He is the famous Naoki Irie.

82
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:10,633
As you know, this school groups classes
by test scores.

83
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,333
<i>Irie is the smartest one in Class A,</i>
<i>which is a class of</i>

84
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,167
<i>highest achievers in our school.</i>

85
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:21,800
<i>He even got the highest scores</i>
<i>in the nation with the last trial exam.</i>

86
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,700
You see, in life, lots of people
know what to do.

87
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:27,933
But few people actually do
what they know.

88
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,667
Knowing is not enough.
You must take action.

89
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,600
<i>They say that his IQ scores are 200.</i>
<i>He is born to be a genius.</i>

90
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,833
<i>And he is so handsome and his father</i>
<i>is a successful business man.</i>

91
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,233
HEIGHT 178 CENTIMETERS
WEIGHT 60 KILOGRAMS

92
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,667
I hear that he is fluent in English.

93
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,367
He is a great athlete, too.
He is the ultimate super boy.

94
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,867
On the other hand, we are in Class F.

95
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,867
We are the bottom losers of this school.

96
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,933
He lives in a different world.

97
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,033
But I tried hard.

98
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,567
In the last three years,

99
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:07,367
I have studied hard,
hoping to join Class A with Irie.

100
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,167
What?

101
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,400
Listen, Kotoko.

102
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:17,900
You know alphabets, right?

103
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,667
Of course, I do.

104
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:25,267
Then tell me how many letters there are
between A and F.

105
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,233
A, B, C, D, E, F.

106
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:40,933
That's right. It would be a miracle if you
could jumps up to Class A.

107
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,400
It would be less possible
than winning a lottery.

108
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,767
It would be less possible
than snow in the summer.

109
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,933
Less possible than being hit
by a shooting star?

110
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,567
What? What did you say?

111
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,533
Nothing.

112
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:58,633
Anyway, Irie is in a different league
from you. Understand?

113
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,300
I know that, but at least I wanted to

114
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:05,267
tell him about my feeling
before both graduate.

115
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,033
You are so naive.

116
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,467
Please accept my gift.

117
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:42,867
<i>Irie is handsome, but everyone knows</i>
<i>that he is a jerk.</i>

118
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,167
<i>He has no interest in girls.</i>

119
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,500
<i>Innumerable girls</i>
<i>have been rejected by him.</i>

120
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,700
<i>He has had no girlfriends so far.</i>

121
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:51,900
29,999 GIRLS WERE REJECTED

122
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Look. It's Kotoko Aihara.

123
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,000
She confessed her love to Irie.

124
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,400
Shut up!

125
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,800
You guys are annoying.

126
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,967
So, what happened?

127
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,667
He is a boy and a high school senior.

128
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,367
No interest in girls?
There is something wrong with him.

129
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,633
I agree. I believe that there is someone
more ordinary out there,

130
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,100
who is perfect for you.

131
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:37,700
Kotoko! Hey, Kotoko!

132
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,267
Hey, Kotoko.

133
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,767
Here he comes.

134
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,767
Hey, Kotoko.

135
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,433
Is it true that Irie of Class A
rejected you? Is it true?

136
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Kin-chan, you are too close.

137
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:53,267
I didn't know that you liked such a nerd.
How dare you?

138
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:54,933
I thought you liked me.

139
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,233
I'm not your girlfriend.

140
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,067
Damn it. I made special Takoyaki
just for you.

141
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:05,033
I wasted my time.

142
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,833
-Excuse me.
-I want it.

143
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,133
Hurry.

144
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,700
-I love Kin-chan's Takoyaki.
-I will open it.

145
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,167
Here you go.

146
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,800
Wow. Thank you.

147
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,700
So delicious.

148
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:29,267
Don't forget to sprinkle
green dried seaweed.

149
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,200
-You sprinkle it.
-Yes, sir.

150
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,933
Cooking is the only thing Kin-chan
is good at.

151
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,300
Only? What do you mean?

152
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,333
I love Kotoko more than anyone.
I'm proud of that.

153
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,067
Class A? Whatever.

154
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,967
I'm better than Irie.

155
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:47,267
Rejecting Kotoko?
I will punish him for it.

156
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,267
This means a war.

157
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,500
He is too arrogant.

158
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,533
Forget it.

159
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,567
You all are right. I was reckless.

160
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:08,767
He didn't even read my letter.
What a jerk he is!

161
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,733
I...

162
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,433
don't have an eye for boys.

163
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,967
So... I'm okay now.

164
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,900
I will be over him.

165
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,267
Kotoko...

166
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,667
Really? How can you yawn
in this situation?

167
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,300
I was up all night last night

168
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,300
and made sure that there would be
no misspelling in my letter.

169
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,300
I even checked kanji characters
of my name with a dictionary.

00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,733
Are you kidding?

173
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,433
That's how nervous I was.

174
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:01,733
I was so nervous that I couldn't eat
breakfast this morning.

175
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,867
So... Kin-chan, thank you.

176
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:07,233
I could survive this morning
with this meal.

177
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,433
I love your smile.

178
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,233
I could make Takoyaki
as many as you want.

179
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Get over it quickly.

180
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,167
It's really good.

181
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,100
Don't take advantage of this situation.
This is not for you.

182
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,500
Sorry.

183
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,000
Well... that's so cute.

184
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,900
-Let's sprinkle dried bonito shavings.
-Put mayo on it.

185
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,967
MR. NAOKI IRIE

186
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,700
Kotoko!

187
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,400
Sorry. We had to talk to the teacher.

188
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,900
Don't worry. I didn't wait that long.

189
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,533
-Let's go home.
-Okay.

190
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,067
By the way, is your new house completed?

191
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,433
Yes. We are moving in on Sunday.

192
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,367
A new home, huh? Very nice.

193
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,333
I guess so. I need it for a change.

194
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,767
That's right. When you move,
luck may turn in your favor.

195
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,567
-Okay.
-That's right.

196
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,167
I believe it.

197
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,033
"I believe." Right?

198
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
Yes, I believe it.

199
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,200
I believe, huh?

200
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,600
I will help you move in.

201
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:34,700
-Thank you.
-Me, too.

202
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,767
Thank you. I'm getting excited.

203
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:38,967
Yeah!

204
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,100
-Wow, it's huge.
-Here you go.

205
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,333
I bring some help.

206
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,000
Dad!

207
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,067
You guys must work for Kotoko.

208
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,767
Okay.

209
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,000
Good morning.

210
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,700
-Good morning.
-Hey, guys.

211
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,767
Thank you for coming.

212
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,267
Father!

213
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,433
I will do anything for Kotoko.

214
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,833
I'm Kinnosuke Ikezawa.

215
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,067
-I'm Gintaro.
-I'm Dozo.

216
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:23,900
Nobody cares about you guys.
Father, think of me as your real son

217
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,567
and tell me anything to do.

218
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,100
Kin-chan, stop your self-promotion.
Start working.

219
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,867
-Sure.
-We appreciate your help.

220
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,467
Let's do it.

221
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,733
Thank you for coming, everyone.

222
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,367
Kin-chan is the one

223
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:41,500
who organized this.
He wanted to come to cheer you up.

224
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,200
Is that so?

225
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:44,567
Be careful with that.

226
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,367
Let's start working.

227
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,300
-Should I take this one?
-Yes, please.

228
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,800
Upstairs.

229
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,133
-Upstairs. Okay.
-Wow, this is heavy.

230
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,100
-Upstairs?
-Upstairs.

231
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:57,700
Thank you so much.

232
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,500
Thank you so much.

233
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,300
Thanks.

234
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,700
Thanks.

235
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,900
Well, now we have everything
in the house.

236
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,200
-Yes.
-Yeah.

237
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,933
What an impressive house it is, Father!

238
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:17,200
My late wife, Kotoko
and I went through a lot.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,133
But finally we have

240
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,433
our own brand-new house.

241
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,833
Come on, Dad.

242
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,867
Stop it. Everyone can see you.

243
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,967
He won't let you, Kotoko,
go easily when you get married.

244
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,733
No worries.

245
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,733
I am willing to live with your father
if we get married.

246
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,767
Father, please consider me
as your real son from now on.

247
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,200
Please call me Kin-chan
as a family member.

248
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,100
Thank you, everyone.

249
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:47,900
Thanks to your help, we could finish
the move-in quickly.

250
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's go inside and eat something.

251
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,000
I will serve my best dishes.

252
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,433
That's right. Kotoko's dad is a chef.

253
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,133
I'm looking forward to it.

254
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,800
We can't wait.

255
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,667
Wait a second.

256
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,267
What?

257
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,067
Can't you hear something strange?

258
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,300
-What?
-No, I can't hear anything.

259
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,167
It's your imagination.

260
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,100
I have a bad feeling about this.

261
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,400
What are you talking about?

262
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,067
What? A shooting star?

263
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,233
During the day? No way.

264
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,233
Are you kidding?

265
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,467
SHIGEO AND KOTOKO AIHARA

266
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,167
It got hit by a shooting star?

267
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:16,200
<i>News 7:00.</i>

268
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,033
{\an8}<i>Around noon today,</i>

269
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,267
{\an8}<i>a shooting star, which is believed to be</i>
<i>a part of the Lyra meteor stream,</i>

270
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,567
{\an8}<i>hit and destroyed a house in Tokyo.</i>

271
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,367
{\an8}My daughter noticed something first
and then--

272
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,067
{\an8}<i>This is Mr. Shigeo Aihara,</i>
<i>whose house was destroyed.</i>

273
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,200
{\an8}Something flashed

274
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,567
{\an8}and hit the roof of my house
in the brink of an eye.

275
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,800
{\an8}Then the house trembled and...

276
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,467
{\an8}And suddenly

277
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,067
{\an8}collapsed.

278
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:49,800
{\an8}First, we saw a hole in the roof

279
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:53,800
{\an8}and I didn't think it would be a big deal.

280
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,733
{\an8}Fortunately,

281
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,867
{\an8}we all were outside.

282
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,800
{\an8}My late wife might

283
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:09,733
{\an8}have saved our lives. I'm sorry.

284
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,800
{\an8}I put all the money I had into this house.

285
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,733
{\an8}So we don't have anywhere to go.

286
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:22,733
{\an8}<i>The fallen meteor is a small rock</i>
<i>with 3 centimeters in diameter.</i>

287
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,467
{\an8}<i>The meteor only triggered the collapse.</i>
<i>The investigators suspect</i>

288
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:31,667
{\an8}<i>corner-cutting construction</i>
<i>as a main cause.</i>

289
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,200
{\an8}<i>Let's move on to the next topic.</i>

290
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:34,900
NO BUSINESS TODAY

291
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,167
I'm sorry, but we are closed today.

292
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,233
Thank you. We are looking forward
to seeing you again.

293
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,467
Dad, cheer up.

294
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,967
I have worked so hard for that house.

295
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,100
Let's start over.

296
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:06,533
How could I open my restaurant
right after such a tragedy?

297
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,733
We need to rent an apartment,

298
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,267
but I spent all the saving to build it.

299
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,100
It would be easier to accept

300
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:19,267
if it was an earthquake or a fire.

301
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,533
Meteor stream? Really?

302
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,100
Even the insurance doesn't cover that.

303
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,667
What rotten luck!

304
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,900
You are wrong.

305
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,600
We got lucky.

306
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,467
Think about it.
If we all had been inside the house,

307
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:43,567
we would have died.

308
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:55,500
If you had been injured, you might have
not been able to work as a chef again.

309
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:59,900
In that case, you would've had no choice
but to close this restaurant permanently.

310
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,067
Am I right?

311
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,467
Look. We escaped without a scratch.

312
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,600
We are lucky.

313
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,800
This is the best luck we've ever had.

314
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,800
Be positive. We are very lucky.

315
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:18,733
What?

316
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,067
You sound exactly like your mom.

317
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,000
Your mom was happy-go-lucky, too.

318
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,833
Happy-go-lucky?
Are you making fun of me?

319
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:38,900
How rare would it be

320
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,700
that a house is struck by a shooting star?

321
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,600
Struck by a shooting star?
Why do you say that?

322
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,600
It sounds more romantic

323
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:52,100
being struck by a shooting star
than being destroyed by meteor.

324
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,867
It makes me feel that it is just
a beginning of something special.

325
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,867
I can't believe it. You have become
more and more like your mom.

326
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,867
Hello, this is Aihara.

327
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,733
Yes.

328
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,467
What?

329
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,700
Yes.

330
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,633
Wait a second.

331
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,300
Boss,

332
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:25,067
somebody wants to talk to you.

333
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:26,633
Okay.

334
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,233
Yes. This is Aihara speaking.
Sorry about today's closure...

335
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:39,800
Iri-chan?

336
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:44,700
How are you doing?
You are still alive, huh?

337
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:48,333
Iri-chan?

338
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,867
Hi, Aihara of Class F.

339
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:55,800
It is her house that was destroyed.

340
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,700
-Did you see the news?
-Yes, I did.

341
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,233
It was reported by newspaper, too.

342
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,867
Right after she was rejected by Irie.
She has no luck.

343
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,900
It is Kotoko who was struck by the Lyra
meteor stream<i>.</i>

344
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:08,400
A tragedy after a tragedy.
Something sinister is haunting her.

345
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,533
Kotoko! Kotoko!

346
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:16,333
Jinko and Satomi.

347
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,967
Everyone is talking about you again today.

348
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm so ashamed
that I want to crawl under the rug.

349
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,267
Do you have a place to stay?

350
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:30,200
Thank you for your concern.
We will stay with my dad's best friend.

351
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,333
Really? You got lucky to find
such a place quickly.

352
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,800
He saw the news and called
my dad's restaurant.

353
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,367
Very generous man. I'm happy for you.
This will be a turning point of your luck.

354
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,600
That's what I thought.

355
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,167
Odds of being struck by a shooting
star are one in hundreds of millions.

356
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,533
I believe that I will have great luck.

357
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,733
Good.

358
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,300
That's Kotoko whom I know.

359
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,100
Is that right?

360
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,433
Donation, please.

361
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,633
What's that?

362
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,600
Even 10 yen is good enough.
Please donate.

363
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,533
How about 5 yen?
Any amount, please.

364
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,533
Donation, please.

365
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,333
We are collecting donation for poor
Kotoko Aihara,

366
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,167
whose house was hit and destroyed

367
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,267
by the Lyra meteor stream yesterday.

368
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,667
Please help your fellow student

369
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,100
who suffers the tragedy.

370
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,133
He is an idiot.

371
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,567
That's Kin-chan. What else can we expect
from him?

372
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:25,600
-I'm sure you have at least 10 yen.
-Stop it, Kin-chan.

373
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:27,800
We have the victim here.

374
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,267
{\an8}She just suffered a tragedy yesterday.

375
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:35,600
{\an8}But today she comes to school
with a smile.

376
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,667
{\an8}Her resilience makes me cry.

377
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,867
{\an8}Stop it. Kin-chan, you are an idiot.

378
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,367
{\an8}What's wrong with you?
I'm trying to help you.

379
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:45,567
I've been humiliated. I don't want
to be in the spotlight anymore.

380
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,333
This makes it worse.

381
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,200
Everyone will make fun of her more.

382
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,333
Get out of my way.

383
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,633
Irie.

384
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:03,733
Irie, who do you think you are?
Be nice to her.

385
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,067
Kotoko is hurt.

386
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,867
Whose fault is that?

387
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:12,567
-Blame the Lyra meteor stream.
-That's another issue.

388
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:16,267
You rejected her in a humiliating way.
Everything started from it.

389
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,500
-That's not a reasonable argument.
-I agree.

390
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:24,933
Your rejection led her
to another disaster.

391
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:31,767
A chance of being hit by a telluric planet
is one in ten billions.

392
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,167
A telluric planet?
You mean a shooting star?

393
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:39,167
Are you blaming me
for such a rare phenomenon?

394
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,367
That's right.

395
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,000
Kin-chan, your argument
is not convincing at all.

396
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,933
I didn't know that I had such a power.

397
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,500
I donate my money.
Are you happy now?

398
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,367
What?

399
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:08,900
Do not pity me.

400
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
I wasted my last two years

401
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,667
by being in love with such a jerk.

402
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,767
I will never want your help.
I will never want your pity.

403
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,967
Really? Are you sure about that?

404
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:30,833
Of course, I'm sure. You are such a jerk
that you don't even have a friend, do you?

405
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,933
Look. I have a lot of friends to help me
when I am in trouble.

406
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,733
Like Kin-chan, Jinko and Satomi.

407
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,200
{\an8}Kotoko, you are doing great.

408
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,467
{\an8}I don't need your help at all.
Understand?

409
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,100
{\an8}DONATE FOR KOTOKO AIHARA

410
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:51,133
{\an8}Here is your 5,000 yen.

411
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,867
We are in Class F, so?

412
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,567
Do not look down on idiots.

413
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,667
You get famous again,
whether you like it or not.

414
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:09,500
Kotoko, you are the only girl
who would pick a fight with Irie.

415
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,167
Oh no, what have I done?

416
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,000
What should I do?

417
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:16,267
That's not what I intended to do.

418
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,467
Sorry that you had to leave school early
to help me.

419
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:42,033
Stop it. I'm happy to help you
in such an emergency.

420
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,267
My teacher knows my situation.

421
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,567
AIHARA

422
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:51,133
This is Iri-chan's house.

423
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,933
It's a huge house.

424
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,133
You are right.

425
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,500
Iri-chan is a CEO of a big company.

426
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:01,600
-He is a graduate of Tokyo University.
-A graduate of Tokyo University? Really?

427
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,133
He must be someone.

428
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:09,200
It's huge. They can have a barbecue party
in the yard.

429
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,900
What?

430
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,633
Iris fomica?

431
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,233
No, it reads Irie.

432
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,367
Irie? I see.

433
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:18,567
Irie?

434
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,133
Yes. His last name is Irie.
That's why I call him Iri-chan.

435
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:24,200
Why on earth does he have a name Irie?

436
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,233
What's the matter?

437
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,967
Nothing.

438
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,633
Let's go.

439
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,967
Hi, Ai-chan. Welcome.

440
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,400
What took you so long?

441
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:45,933
Sorry. It took us so long to pick up
our stuff in the rubble.

442
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,800
Really? I am glad to see you.

443
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,700
Hi.

444
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,033
I was so surprised.

445
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,133
I was talking to myself.

446
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,300
Ai-chan!

447
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:08,167
Iri-chan!

448
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,733
You two are so close, huh?

449
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
-I was looking forward to seeing you.
-I'm so happy to see you.

450
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,900
Make yourself at home.

451
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:21,433
-We really appreciate your kindness.
-Don't mention it.

452
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,300
Mrs. Irie, thank you for having us.

453
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:27,067
I'm sorry that you had such a disaster.
Stay as long as you want.

454
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:30,867
I'm his daughter, Kotoko.
Nice to meet you.

455
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,267
You are so cute.
I'm so glad to meet you.

456
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,000
Unfortunately we have only boys.

457
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:38,600
You have sons?

458
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,933
You will meet them later.
Come in.

459
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,167
Come in. Come in.

460
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,067
Come in.

461
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,700
Excuse us.

462
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,367
-Use the slippers.
-Thank you.

463
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,933
This is so cute.

464
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,000
Hi, Yuki. Come down.

465
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,033
Introduce yourself. They are
Mr. Aihara and his daughter.

466
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
He is your son?

467
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:06,600
So cute.

468
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,733
-Hello.
-How do you do?

469
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,533
My name is Yuki Irie.
I'm in the third grade.

470
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,833
Very smart boy.

471
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,133
Very nice to meet you.

472
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,533
Nice to meet you, Yuki.

473
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,600
You two must be tired.

474
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,467
Let's settle down.

475
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:29,567
Let's move.

476
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,567
I'm coming in.

477
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,933
-Here you go.
-This is delicious.

478
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm glad that you like it.
Have more.

479
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,467
Thank you.

480
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,633
Kotoko, you've grown up so much.

481
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
Have we met before?

482
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:57,767
You were still a baby.
I saw you at your dad's restaurant.

483
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,600
-You've come to his restaurant?
-Yes.

484
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:06,333
Of course. We have been best friends
since the kindergarten in Kyushu.

485
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,700
Both of my parents were working.

486
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:15,900
So I stayed at his house after school
and had dinner with him.

487
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:19,300
And I was a poor student at college.

488
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:24,033
Since Ai-chan was a chef,
he often fed me.

489
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,033
You took care of me.

490
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,667
It was nothing.

491
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,933
You introduced a lot of good customers
to me when I started my business.

492
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,200
It was nothing.

493
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:37,333
Your friends from Tokyo University
and your clients.

494
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,433
Many of them are still
my regular customers.

495
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:43,833
I owe you a lot in my business success.

496
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,167
That's not true.

497
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:50,733
We both got married, had kids

498
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,400
and got busy with our own business.
We became estranged a little.

499
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:00,067
I was shocked at the news.

500
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,300
It was very unfortunate,

501
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,233
but it made us get closer again.
I'm so happy to see you again. Right?

502
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,833
I'm happy, too.

503
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:17,333
Kotoko, please make yourself at home
and enjoy your stay.

504
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,567
Thank you.

505
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:24,333
Kotoko, you will find that this
is a small world.

506
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,500
What?

507
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:46,233
Speak of the devil.
Here our big boy comes.

508
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,267
Big boy?

509
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,533
-What's wrong with you, Kotoko?
-Kotoko is full of energy.

510
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Hi, I'm the oldest son, Naoki.

511
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:01,967
Very nice to meet you.

512
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,467
He told me that

513
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:09,667
you two attend the same high school.

514
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:13,033
Really? I didn't know that.
It's very nice to meet you.

515
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,733
Hey, Kotoko. Say hi.

516
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,733
What's the matter?

517
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,900
That's because...

518
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,100
I'm so stunned.

519
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:33,567
Iri-chan and Irie
do not look alike at all.

520
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,200
Don't be silly.

521
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,433
Both of our sons take after their mother.

522
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,133
In that sense, they are very lucky.

523
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,033
Stop it, honey.

524
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,867
Come on, you sit down here.

525
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,967
I'm so glad that you two are not hurt.

526
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,900
We are lucky.

527
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,433
You were at home?

528
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,833
If Kotoko hadn't stopped me,
I would have been inside the house.

529
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,900
Then you would have been killed.

530
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:25,367
You dodged a bullet, huh?

531
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,433
How big was the meteor?

532
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:34,233
Like this big. It was pretty small.

533
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,733
-About 3 centimeters?
-Yes.

534
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,133
I must wonder how such a small one
could destroy the house.

535
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:46,167
I'm glad that you two
have known each other.

536
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,867
Are you two in the same class?

537
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,500
Not in the same class, but we got to know
each other in an unexpected way.

538
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,333
Right, Kotoko?

539
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,000
I guess so.

540
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:06,533
That's nice. Now you can get to know
each other more.

541
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,933
He is a little strange, isn't he?

542
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,400
Please befriend him.

543
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,800
Brother, I've already done my homework.

544
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,667
Really? Good.

545
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:24,767
But I have a kanji character
which I don't know how to read.

546
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,467
Instead of asking you,

547
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,833
I may want to ask it to Kotoko.

548
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:32,767
Good idea.

549
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,400
Can you teach me how to read
a kanji character?

550
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,667
Su...sure.

551
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:45,333
<i>He is in the third grade.</i>
<i>I'm sure I can read their characters.</i>

552
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:00,733
What's wrong?

553
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,400
Yuki, I'm impressed.

554
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:15,833
You are studying such difficult characters
in the third grade.

555
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,467
Which one do you not understand?

556
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:19,767
This one.

557
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,967
TONIKAKU
(REGARDLESS)

558
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:25,033
This one, huh?

559
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:29,267
This one reads "Usagi-ni Tsuno."

560
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,633
It means "a rabbit with horns."

561
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,333
Are you kidding?

562
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,867
This reads "Tonikaku."

563
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:44,033
Can't you read this? You are
in a high school, aren't you?

564
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,800
Yuki, you are so rude. Apologize.

565
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,567
Regardless, I don't like you.

566
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,267
Yuki!

567
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,033
Hey!

568
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,533
I'm really sorry. He is so rude.

569
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,333
It's true that I couldn't read it.
It's my fault.

570
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,333
Well, he doesn't know many teenage girls.
So he is embarrassed.

571
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,667
Do not take it seriously, Kotoko.

572
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,900
Let's forget it.

573
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:20,033
-Kotoko, you want to see your room?
-Good idea.

574
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,967
I did my best. Come with me.

575
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,467
Eat it, Ai-chan.

576
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:33,967
-This is so delicious.
-Is that right?

577
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,033
I'm not joking.

578
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,267
Ta-da! What do you think?

579
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,300
No? You don't like it?

580
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,200
I did too much?

581
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,033
We only have boys, right?

582
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,033
I really wanted a daughter.

583
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,033
I have wanted to decorate a room like
this for a long time.

584
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,900
Such as curtains with frills
and stuffed animals.

585
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,500
I'm so happy.

586
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:19,767
Since I lost my mom when I was young,

587
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:23,433
I never had a chance
to have anything girlish.

588
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,700
You know my father, right?

589
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:29,567
He only buys me simple
and sturdy clothes.

590
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:32,800
I was so jealous of my friends

591
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,967
who wore a frilly dress.

592
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,833
I feel that my dream finally comes true.

593
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,233
That's why...

594
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,100
My dream was to go shopping,
go to a movie with a daughter

595
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:50,667
and to exchange each other's clothes.

596
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,967
We are perfect for each other.
Don't you think, Kotoko?

597
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:57,233
Yes.

598
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:04,267
This room used to be Yuki's.

599
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,700
What?

600
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,867
He had to move into my room.

601
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,833
Now I feel crammed.

602
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:14,033
Come on. We were so excited.

603
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,067
Don't be a downer.

604
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:18,433
<i>Now I get why he was so...</i>

605
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:21,700
Regardless, I don't like you.

606
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:26,933
Kotoko, don't worry about it.

607
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,400
Just make yourself at home.

608
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:32,000
Okay.

609
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:36,500
Son, please help her organize her stuff.

610
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:39,667
I must cook dinner now.

611
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,800
Tonight's dinner is sukiyaki.

612
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,133
Kotoko, do you like sukiyaki?

613
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,733
I love it.

614
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,633
I'm so glad to hear that.

615
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,333
See you later.

616
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,967
See you.

617
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,167
Well...

618
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:06,400
Well,

619
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,967
tell me what to do.

620
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,633
I don't need your help.

621
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,167
That's right.

622
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,800
You don't want to have anything to do
with me.

623
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,367
MR. NAOKI IRIE

624
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:40,700
I don't care if you live with us or not.

625
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,667
Just don't bother me.

626
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:10,400
<i>A chance of being hit by a shooting star</i>
<i>is one in ten billions.</i>

627
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,400
<i>What are the odds that</i>

628
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:15,833
<i>a high school girl must live with a boy</i>

629
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,800
<i>who just rejected her?</i>

630
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:22,467
<i>Is it a beginning of something special?</i>

631
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,333
<i>Or something else...</i>

632
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,433
Here comes.

633
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,033
We have more.

634
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,267
Thank you.

635
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:56,900
Mr. Aihara, would you like one?

636
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:58,933
I love to.

637
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:04,500
Sorry that we didn't ask you whether
you like bread or rice for breakfast.

638
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,267
Don't worry. This is great.

639
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,133
Are you sure about that?

640
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,267
Eat more.

641
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,100
I feel like we are vacationing abroad.

642
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,800
Like being in Monaco.

643
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:24,733
<i>Now I realize that</i>

644
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,933
<i>I'm eating breakfast</i>

645
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,100
<i>with the famous Irie.</i>

646
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:45,067
So clumsy.

647
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:47,100
Be nice, Yuki.

648
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:51,200
I'm done.

649
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:53,433
Is it already time for you to leave?

650
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,567
Kotoko, why don't you go with him?
You two go to the same school.

651
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:58,800
Sure.

652
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,367
Dad, finish the rest.

653
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,733
Thank you for the meal.
See you later.

654
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,533
Have a great day.

655
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,500
-Listen.
-Yes.

656
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,967
Do not walk next to me.

657
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:23,867
Why?

658
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:28,067
I don't want to walk along with a girl
who has bread crumb everywhere.

659
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,800
Stay away at least 2 meters from me.

660
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,200
Follow me today and memorize
the route to the school.

661
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:52,200
And of course, do not tell anyone
that we live together.

662
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,633
Moreover, do not talk to me at all
at school.

663
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,933
You don't need to humiliate me that much.

664
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:02,200
I don't want to get involved in such
a ridiculous gossip anymore.

665
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,067
Ridiculous?!

666
00:47:07,133 --> 00:47:09,967
I don't like a stupid girl.

667
00:47:30,867 --> 00:47:33,267
<i>I'm so humiliated.</i>

668
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,667
<i>How could I be in love with such a jerk</i>
<i>for two long years?</i>

669
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:43,667
<i>I will make him regret what he said,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

670
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,267
Even a genius has a soft spot, huh?

671
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,333
NEXT EPISODE

672
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,133
We only have a week until term-end
exams. Help me study.

673
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,367
It's impossible to get an idiot like you
into the top 100.

674
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:33,467
She has acted strangely since
she moved into a new house.

675
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,600
She is flirting with another man.

676
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,567
As he keeps acting like that,

677
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:42,867
I'm afraid that he may never learn
something precious.

678
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,200
-Aihara.
-Damn Irie.

679
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:48,033
{\an8}I'm afraid that he may change his mind
and go out with Kotoko.

680
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,400
{\an8}Thank you, Irie.

681
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:50,467
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
