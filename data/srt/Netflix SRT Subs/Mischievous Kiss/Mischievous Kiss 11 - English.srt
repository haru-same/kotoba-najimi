1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,567
Are you okay, Yuki?!

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:04,967
The surgery should be done immediately.

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:06,733
Your brother fell sick!

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,133
Don't you think you're too selfish?

5
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,633
Know that it's important
to communicate

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,067
your feelings to the people around you.

7
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,033
Thanks, Kotoko.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,633
Graduating university and taking over
my father's business

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,700
are things my parents
are expecting me to do.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,900
Brother...

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,700
<i>Of course, things were happening</i>
<i>without my knowledge.</i>

12
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,167
<i>I assumed that</i>

13
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>there was no progress</i>
<i>with my relationship with Irie.</i>

14
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,600
<i>And as days went by,</i>

15
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>Yuki's surgery was a success,</i>

16
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:58,767
<i>and by the time he left the hospital,</i>
<i>it was New Year's Eve.</i>

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,367
<i>For couples,</i>

18
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,333
<i>it was the extremely anticipated</i>
<i>Christmas season.</i>

19
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,800
<i>But for singles...</i>

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,700
You're welcome.

21
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:19,533
Hey there, young man!

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,200
Will you refill my water, too?

23
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:31,500
You only ordered coffee and water.
How much longer are going to sit here?

24
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,600
Wait! Actually...

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,100
Irie, I was wondering what you were doing
on Christmas Eve.

26
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,933
Are you coming back home?

27
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,400
Work.

28
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,067
Hey.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,533
Since he's working at a cafe, there's
no way he can take off Christmas Eve.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,500
Are you working that day, too,
Ms. Matsumoto?

31
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,000
Yup!

32
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,100
I'm going to work hard with Irie.

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,967
We have many reservations that day.

34
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,633
Then I'll make a reservation, too!

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,133
Oh, would you like to?

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,067
Our cafe will only be serving
full course dinners that day.

37
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,300
It's exclusive to couples, too.

38
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,167
Dinner for two?! And 20,000 yen?!

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,733
There's no way...

40
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,733
It's fine!

41
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:52,000
If I don't get to spend it with Irie,
I'll spend it with my friends!

42
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,133
Kotoko?!

43
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,133
Kotoko!

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,567
Hey, Jinko! Satomi!

45
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,000
So, about Christmas this year...

46
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:05,233
Actually, I wanted to introduce you
to someone today.

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,133
-Introduce me?
-Yup.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
There he is!

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,933
Huh? What?

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,967
-Hey, do you have a minute?
-Sure.

51
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,167
Hey, come with me!

52
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,000
Let me introduce you.

53
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,100
My boyfriend Narasaki is in a band.

54
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,033
I'm Narasaki, nice to meet you.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,333
My boyfriend is Ryo Takamiya.
He studies law.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Nice to meet you, I'm Ryo Takamiya.

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,333
Boyfriend?

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,567
Both of you?! How? When?!

59
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,600
I wanted to introduce you to him
before Christmas, no matter what.

60
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,633
Oh, I see.

61
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:51,033
Congratulations to both of you.

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,500
Thanks!

63
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,967
<i>So, right before my first Christmas</i>
<i>as a college student,</i>

64
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,200
<i>I faced a dire situation where I was</i>
<i>the only one who was single.</i>

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,067
<i>I have a feeling this is going to be</i>
<i>the worst Christmas ever!</i>

66
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:11,667
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

67
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,467
{\an8}MY BOYFRIEND IS SANTA CLAUS

68
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:21,233
{\an8}Oh, dear... Oh, dear...

69
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,600
How melancholic.

70
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,933
Kotoko!

71
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,933
Hey, Kin. Aren't you working?
Don't slack off.

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm almost done.

73
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:38,300
But, anyway, I heard Jinko and Satomi
have boyfriends now!

74
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,967
Well, it's true...

75
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,667
That means that they'll be
spending a passionate

76
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,100
Christmas Eve with them, right?

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,267
They're spending Christmas with their
boyfriends for the first time, of course.

78
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,567
This...

79
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,800
is serious!

80
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
That means you're going to be...

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,033
alone, Kotoko.

82
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,567
Please don't remind me.

83
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,367
Aren't you lonely?

84
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,600
Aren't you sad?

85
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,167
So, I have a special plan for you, Kotoko.

86
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,700
There you are!

87
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,533
Jinko?

88
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,167
Kotoko, I need to talk to you!

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,267
You can't spend Christmas Eve
with Narasaki anymore?!

90
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,300
But this was going to be
your first Christmas Eve together!

91
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,433
I know, right? But Narasaki's like:

92
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,767
"I'm going to play in a Christmas show.

93
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,900
Christmas is the day of love.

94
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:54,033
As a musician, I have to spread the love
to the world that day."

95
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:58,100
Can't you see him after the show?

96
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:03,667
The show's going to be in Sendai,
not Tokyo.

97
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,700
It ends late, too.

98
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,867
There's no way
he can come back that night.

99
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:14,700
But he's working towards becoming
a professional musician, right?

100
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,300
You should support that.

101
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:19,667
I understand that! But...

102
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,333
I wish he would spread the love to me,

103
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
not just the world!

104
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you understand?

105
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,133
-Yeah. Eat up.
-So, you're going to eat?

106
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,533
I'll eat away the pain!

107
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,367
There you are!

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,533
Can you believe this?! Ryo...

109
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,367
Ryo... Ryo...

110
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,667
He told me
he can't spend Christmas with me!

111
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,100
Satomi, you too?!

112
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,333
No way!

113
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,767
Ryo said

114
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,767
he really can't take the day off
from work.

115
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,800
He said it's because he wants
to buy me a present.

116
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,967
But what we crave is their heart,
not material things!

117
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:06,000
Exactly! Guys really don't understand
how girls feel.

118
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,500
I want to be with him that night,
no matter what!

119
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:12,200
Why can't he understand that?!

120
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,667
Seriously!

121
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,433
All right!

122
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,067
Let's forget about the guys
who don't understand us!

123
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,100
This Christmas,

124
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:28,567
let's have fun with just us girls!

125
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,933
I'm in!

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,800
But are you sure, Kotoko?

127
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:35,767
Yeah, isn't Irie coming home
for Christmas?

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,567
Actually, he can't get out of work either.

129
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,033
Yuko Matsumoto is working with him, too.

130
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
-The worst!
-The worst!

131
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,367
I think I'm dealing with the worst case

132
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,733
of a guy who doesn't understand
a girl's feelings.

133
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,233
Though, I'm not even Irie's girlfriend.

134
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,333
That doesn't matter!

135
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,100
Men can never be trusted!

136
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,933
Exactly! You can only believe
your girlfriends!

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,267
Put your hand out, girls!

138
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:10,167
Let's swear that the three of us will
spend a fun Christmas together!

139
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,367
Agreed!

140
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,767
Betrayal is not an option!

141
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,233
Yes!

142
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,767
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute!

143
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,500
How about me?!

144
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,933
Uh-oh! Now you're scaring me!

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,133
You can't just put me in the same category
as some other guy.

146
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,100
If you're having a party,
count me in, too, will you?

147
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,700
I'll prepare a Christmas feast for you,
how about that?

148
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,533
I won't betray you.

149
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,967
Let's make it

150
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:45,967
a fun night together!
Together... Together...

151
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,367
Together...

152
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,767
What's wrong?

153
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,733
Kin, I know you're training, but you're
in the food and beverage industry.

154
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,667
Yeah, how about Aihara?

155
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:11,833
Exactly. There's no restaurant that'll
allow you to take Christmas Eve off.

156
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,367
What?

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Wouldn't they end earlier, at least?

158
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,033
Your reservation is confirmed.

159
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,833
-Thank you very much!
-Spending Christmas with Kotoko!

160
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,333
Christmas with Kotoko!

161
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,933
Aren't you excited for Christmas?!

162
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,933
-Let's see, two, four, six, ten...
-What?

163
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,533
No way! The tables...

164
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,267
and counters are all completely reserved!

165
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,667
Of course, it's Christmas Eve!

166
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:52,200
The first rush starts at 6
and the second starts at 8!

167
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:57,100
Recently, there's been many walk-ins, too.
It's going to be busy!

168
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:01,700
But isn't Christmas a Christian holiday?

169
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,300
Why would you eat
Japanese cuisine that day?!

170
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:07,200
But it's something
we should be grateful for.

171
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:10,467
Since the boss is leaving around 9,
we're going to be

172
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,433
the only two working.

173
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,467
Why? Where's he going?

174
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,800
He said he has something important.
Probably some party.

175
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,033
Party?

176
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Must be a Christmas party!

177
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,400
A Christmas party?!

178
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,467
Oh, my God!

179
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,333
That's right!

180
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,667
His company's celebrating
its 20th anniversary.

181
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,467
So, that's why, on Christmas Eve,
we're having a party

182
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,267
at Hotel Prince!

183
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,000
Is that so?

184
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:41,600
Congratulations!

185
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,633
Why, yes. Oh?

186
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,367
My dear.

187
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,667
My, my.

188
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,933
I wouldn't be here

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,500
without everyone's support.

190
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:54,500
It's a way to express my gratitude.

191
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,033
And to top it off,

192
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,333
Kotoko's father said
he'll come by after work, too!

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,100
He said that?

194
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,833
Yup. Among the party attendees

195
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,867
are good customers of Aihara.

196
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,267
And there's a lot of people

197
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,200
I want him to meet at this party.

198
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:16,500
So, I'm hoping
you can come, too, Kotoko.

199
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,633
That sounds wonderful!

200
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,600
Christmas at Hotel Prince?

201
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,233
Right?

202
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,833
<i>Let's swear that the three of us will</i>
<i>spend a fun Christmas together!</i>

203
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,033
<i>Agreed!</i>

204
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
<i>Betrayal is not an option!</i>

205
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,300
<i>Yes!</i>

206
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,267
But I'm sorry.
I already have engagements that day.

207
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,233
Engagements?

208
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,767
Is it with a man?

209
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,200
Kotoko!

210
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,200
Are you seeing someone besides my son?

211
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,300
No way! It's not that.

212
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,233
I already promised Jinko and Satomi.

213
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,267
I would've loved to go
since you invited me, but...

214
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,433
Well...

215
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,533
can't you do anything about those plans?

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There's no way out of it this time.

217
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,067
It's a long story.

218
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,900
I see.

219
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, that's unfortunate.
But there's nothing we can do about it.

220
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,667
Hey, Mom, how about brother?

221
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,733
He's coming to the party, too, right?

222
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,267
Actually,

223
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,600
he can't go either.

224
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,767
What? Are you serious?

225
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,333
He said he had to work at the cafe
on Christmas Eve.

226
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,867
Oh, man. That's a drag.

227
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,367
I know.

228
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:46,333
I can't believe he's missing
his father's company party.

229
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,400
Well, this is rare.

230
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,167
You never ask to meet
at places like this.

231
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,800
-Ginger ale, please.
-Yes, right away.

232
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,733
So, what did you want to talk about?

233
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:43,433
You heard about my company's
anniversary party from your mom, right?

234
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,300
I want you to attend.

235
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,567
Please.

236
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,333
I know your ulterior motive, Dad.

237
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,633
You want to introduce me

238
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,700
to the guests
as the company's successor, right?

239
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:03,833
But I...

240
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,467
still haven't decided whether
I'm succeeding your company.

241
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,467
I understand that.

242
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,667
But will you please attend,
just this once?

243
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,800
Don't worry about what's to come.

244
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,967
It'd be great if you made an appearance.

245
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,033
Please, just this once.

246
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:41,533
SANSEIDO USED BOOKS

247
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,900
-MEDICAL INTERN
-DIAGNOSTICS, EMERGENCY

248
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,500
<i>You can do anything, Irie.</i>

249
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,767
<i>You'll invent different types of medicine.</i>

250
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:20,033
Become a doctor and cure all illnesses!

251
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,700
-He's up early.
-Yes, he is.

252
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,100
Irie, why are you here?!

253
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,233
What?

254
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,167
I can't come back to my own home?

255
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,467
No, it's just been a while.

256
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,900
But why did you decide to come here?

257
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,533
I'm here to get my suit.

258
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,233
-Suit?!
-Suit?!

259
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,600
I can't attend the party with jeans.

260
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,533
You're going to attend
our Christmas Eve party?!

261
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,367
Work's letting me off early,
but I'll be late.

262
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,600
I won't stay long either.

263
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,900
Yes! Brother's going to be there, too!

264
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,800
Thank you! Father will be
very happy about this!

265
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:28,000
<i>So, Irie's going to the party after all...</i>

266
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,467
<i>That means if I attend,</i>

267
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:35,067
<i>I'll be able to spend Christmas with him!</i>

268
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,633
<i>It's a hard decision,</i>

269
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,467
<i>but betraying my friends</i>
<i>for this chance is forgivable, right?</i>

270
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,767
I would love to attend the party.

271
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Heard you can't go.

272
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,133
You're spending Christmas
with your usual girlfriends, right?

273
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,067
Well, you know, so...

274
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:01,467
That's disappointing. It would've been fun
if you were there.

275
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,767
Irie, um, I...

276
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,133
Yes, I know!

277
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,033
Will you please convince Kotoko
to attend, too?

278
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,567
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.

279
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,000
You made your decision already.

280
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,800
But still.

281
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:24,767
I'm sure your girlfriends
would betray you in a heartbeat.

282
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,267
It's Christmas Eve!

283
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,300
No, their friendship is special.

284
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,167
Isn't that right, Kotoko?

285
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,900
Sure, well, but...

286
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,833
Are you sure about that?

287
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,833
Brother.

288
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,567
Let's get you that suit!

289
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,800
The one you wore for your graduation!

290
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,867
Irie, you're such a bully!

291
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,400
But, oh, well...

292
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:02,067
I promised I wouldn't betray them.

293
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,400
<i>Christmas</i>

294
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,000
Look at that!

295
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,333
So, the cake is going to be
the exclusive Shibuya one, right?

296
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,233
I'll order one for us.

297
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,067
-I'm so excited! It looks so good!
-I know, right?

298
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,767
<i>Going to the party with Irie...</i>

299
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,067
Kotoko?

300
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,467
-Kotoko?
-Kotoko?

301
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,867
-Kotoko! Are you there?
-Yes!

302
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:33,933
Look at this!

303
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,100
They look delicious!

304
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,700
I'll prepare the chicken.

305
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,367
I'll bring games.

306
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:44,200
Of course,
Christmas is all about presents!

307
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,967
-Yes!
-<i>Yup.</i>

308
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,867
<i>They're both really looking forward to it.</i>

309
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,600
<i>This was the right decision.</i>

310
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,533
White Christmas, yeah!

311
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:01,867
CHRISTMAS EVE

312
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,200
-Looks good!
-All right!

313
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,167
Are you all ready to go?

314
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,367
Yes!

315
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh? Where's Naoki?

316
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:17,967
He's coming directly from his job.

317
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:21,067
Mr. Aihara will also come a little late
from his restaurant.

318
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:24,233
I see, then we're all ready.
Let's go!

319
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,700
Yes!

320
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,333
Kotoko, are you sure about this?

321
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,733
Even my son made arrangements to attend.

322
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Yes, but unfortunately, I already made
a promise to my friends.

323
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:41,333
But, anyway, thank you very much
for letting us use your place.

324
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,633
Jinko and Satomi were ecstatic!

325
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,533
Really? I'm glad it worked out.

326
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,667
We're going to be late tonight.

327
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:52,433
So, I'm grateful that you and your friends
will be here at our place.

328
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,433
Recently,

329
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,700
it may be because it's the end
of the year,

330
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,633
there's been thieves lurking around!

331
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,367
So, it's safer if you girls are here,
having a blast.

332
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:11,033
-Yes, thank you very much.
-My pleasure.

333
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,733
Well, it's still regrettable
that you can't come with us,

334
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,200
but have fun with your friends!

335
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,233
I will!

336
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:19,733
Let's go already!

337
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,067
All right, let's go.

338
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,433
See you later!

339
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:36,433
Irie in a suit...

340
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,067
He must look so handsome...

341
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:47,233
Party, huh?

342
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,100
Will you dance with me?

343
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,000
It would be my pleasure.

344
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,933
No, don't do that!

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,767
It's totally girls' night!

346
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,767
<i>Girls' night with Jinko and Satomi</i>

347
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,367
Over there.

348
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,867
How cute!

349
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,233
Christmas is so fun!

350
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,900
This is too long.

351
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,467
How long is this thing?

352
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,233
I didn't expect this to happen!

353
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,400
There!

354
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,533
What should I wish for...

355
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,600
as a Christmas present?

356
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,900
MERRY CHRISTMAS

357
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,467
All set!

358
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,500
I was supposed to be working with Irie.

359
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,900
It wasn't supposed to be like this!

360
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,600
Merry Christmas!

361
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,833
But what a coincidence.

362
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,033
I didn't expect you to be working here
on Christmas.

363
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,567
So, what do you think?

364
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:41,233
Can I take you out for dinner
after you're done?

365
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,167
But you're already eating.

366
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:47,067
For two.

367
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,600
Excuse me, Miss Waitress.
May I get more water?

368
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,733
Waitress! Waitress Matsumoto!

369
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,433
May I get some water?

370
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,933
<i>I wish I was waiting</i>

371
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,833
<i>for Irie to come over right now.</i>

372
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,500
They must be here soon.

373
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,333
Hello, Jinko? What's up?

374
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,433
<i>I'm sorry, Kotoko!</i>

375
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,233
<i>Narasaki's show in Sendai got canceled</i>
<i>due to the snow.</i>

376
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:50,000
So, he hitchhiked back

377
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,700
to Tokyo to be with me!

378
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:55,767
He hitchhiked back
since the trains weren't running!

379
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:59,367
I can't leave Narasaki here
and go to the party.

380
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:04,000
Will you please let me choose
my man over us, just this once?!

381
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,533
Got it. I'll let Satomi know, too.

382
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,233
It's fine!

383
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,133
It's an unforeseen circumstance.

384
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,433
Tell Narasaki I said hello.

385
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,533
Well...

386
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,333
I'll just have a blast with Satomi, then.

387
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,167
Hello? What's up, Satomi?

388
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,833
<i>Sorry, Kotoko.</i>

389
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,733
Ryo was lying about having work today.

390
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,433
He just came over with roses

391
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,533
without notice!

392
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,900
<i>He was planning to surprise me all along.</i>

393
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:55,433
<i>He made reservations at a restaurant</i>
<i>way in advance.</i>

394
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,500
It's one of those "surprises," right?

395
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:01,700
So...

396
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>I feel really bad, but...</i>

397
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,467
I understand.

398
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:09,600
I'll spend Christmas with Jinko, then.

399
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:13,367
I'm so sorry.
I'll treat you guys next time.

400
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,600
Don't worry about it. Have fun.

401
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,633
<i>Thanks!</i>

402
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,567
They betrayed me after all!

403
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,133
If I knew this would happen,

404
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,733
I should've attended the party, too!

405
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:42,433
Oh, yeah, I should head over there now!

406
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:50,033
Jinko and Satomi got last-minute plans
with their boyfriends, so...

407
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,867
now I'm here.

408
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,100
I told you so.

409
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,233
You can't trust your girlfriends.

410
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Betrayed by your friends?
How stupid are you?

411
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,700
That's not very appealing to my brother.

412
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,367
No, no, no.

413
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:13,000
No, that's not good.

414
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,700
It'll look too bad.

415
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,133
Thank you very much!

416
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:32,067
I'm leaving the rest to you.

417
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:33,800
Yes, you got it!

418
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,267
There's one more reservation to go.

419
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,233
-We can handle this.
-Yes.

420
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:46,767
But I've never seen the restaurant get
that packed before.

421
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,500
We got to be grateful for Christmas!

422
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,367
-They're here.
-Welcome!

423
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,633
Welcome!

424
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,300
Thanks.

425
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,500
This is a star-rated place.

426
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,000
While preserving tradition,

427
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:05,267
they're known for their unconventional
neo-Japanese cuisine.

428
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,767
Really?

429
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,100
You have such refined taste, Ryo!

430
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,433
-You're so cool!
-Thanks.

431
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,767
Satomi?!

432
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,967
Kin, what are you doing here?

433
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh, was this Kotoko's father's restaurant?

434
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:27,267
It's your friend's place?!

435
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,967
I'm impressed, Satomi.
You got me there.

436
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:33,533
Satomi, didn't you have plans
with Kotoko?

437
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,900
Where's Kotoko?

438
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,233
Sorry, Kin.

439
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
My boyfriend surprised me with plans.

440
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,367
-I'm Ryo Takamiya.
-Is Kotoko alone right now?

441
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,767
She's with Jinko.

442
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,433
I'm sure they're having a blast by now.

443
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,733
I see.

444
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,800
Wow, that looks delicious!

445
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:00,433
Veggie and tiger prawn tempura.

446
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,467
I would never think to have
Japanese food on Christmas.

447
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,900
-I know.
-I think it's great!

448
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,700
Jin--

449
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:12,567
What was that?

450
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm helping
with Narasaki's show right now.

451
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,867
Aren't you supposed to be
at the party with Kotoko?

452
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:25,333
Actually, Narasaki surprised me today.

453
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,633
<i>Kotoko should be with Satomi right now.</i>

454
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:34,300
All right then, have fun.

455
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:36,067
Merry Christmas.

456
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:58,967
<i>Love, love, love</i>

457
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:04,633
<i>Lust, lust, lust</i>

458
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:10,367
<i>No, this is love, love, love</i>

459
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,900
<i>Love, love, love</i>

460
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,100
<i>But still,</i>

461
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:21,467
<i>I'm sure your girlfriends</i>
<i>will betray you in a heartbeat.</i>

462
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,600
<i>It's Christmas Eve!</i>

463
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,133
<i>Lust, lust, lust</i>

464
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:35,033
<i>Love, love, love</i>

465
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,067
<i>Christmas</i>

466
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,767
<i>With Irie</i>

467
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,733
I'm hungry.

468
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,367
Jinko and Satomi were supposed
to bring the chicken and cake.

469
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:31,533
So, I only prepared snacks.

470
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,900
INSTANT NOODLES

471
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,833
Salt ramen, huh?

472
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,167
<i>It's Christmas Eve!</i>

473
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,267
<i>What is everyone up to?</i>

474
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,500
<i>Is that so?</i>

475
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,000
<i>On Christmas Eve,</i>

476
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:55,233
<i>couples enjoy dinner together.</i>

477
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,200
<i>But are some of us</i>

478
00:33:57,267 --> 00:34:01,200
<i>spending Christmas alone right now?</i>

479
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:04,667
<i>I'm sure you're out there.</i>

480
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:08,567
<i>You should ask yourself whether</i>
<i>you have a horrible personality.</i>

481
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,400
<i>But Christmas sure is a fun holiday!</i>

482
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,833
<i>I'm all about it!</i>

483
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,700
<i>My brain explodes since it's too much!</i>

484
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,567
<i>Hilarious, right?</i>

485
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,200
<i>What do you think?</i>

486
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:23,967
<i>But anyway...</i>

487
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,167
This is sad.

488
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:28,400
<i>Sad and alone...</i>

489
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,667
<i>Isn't it fun?!</i>

490
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,367
<i>How's that?</i>

491
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,667
<i>Please, tell me.</i>

492
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,167
What was that?

493
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,100
<i>Recently,</i>

494
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,167
there's been thieves lurking around!

495
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,867
Could it be?

496
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
No.

497
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,333
It's possible, since...

498
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,833
the Iries are rich.

499
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,567
What should I do?

500
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,267
Oh, yeah!

501
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,933
Thief!

502
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,567
Stop! Stop! Stop!

503
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,300
What are you doing?

504
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:46,867
Irie?!

505
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,200
Sorry. Are you okay?

506
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,700
<i>You look so handsome.</i>

507
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:13,133
What?

508
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,667
Well, because...

509
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:20,933
you were getting hit in the head
while looking so elegant.

510
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,333
Plus,

511
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,400
it's your own home!

512
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:26,833
You're the one who did it.

513
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,167
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,533
Oh, man...

515
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,333
Sorry about that.

516
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,533
I got scared of the sound of the locks.

517
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,467
I thought you were a thief.

518
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,533
I accidentally tried to open the door
with my apartment key first.

519
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:59,433
You hit me so hard.

520
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,533
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:12,467
But what happened
to your father's party?

522
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:13,867
You didn't go?

523
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,300
I went.

524
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,133
But I left in the middle of it.

525
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,700
I got bored saying hello to the heads
of the companies he works with.

526
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:30,433
Father must be so mad right now.

527
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,500
But, anyway, how are you?

528
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:39,133
Weren't you having a party
with your friends?

529
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,467
Well, actually, both Jinko and Satomi...

530
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,633
got last-minute plans
with their boyfriends.

531
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,233
What loyal friends.

532
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't mention it.

533
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,367
What's this smell?

534
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,267
This?

535
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:16,667
Chicken!

536
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,567
Did you bring that for me?

537
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,033
Of course not.

538
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,000
I got hungry.

539
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,400
You can't really eat

540
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,700
at a buffet party.

541
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,767
I only ate instant noodles myself.

542
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:52,033
Well, what a night.

543
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,367
Well done.

544
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:57,000
-Let's close up and leave!
-Yeah.

545
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,533
Can I ask you something?

546
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,767
I want to try something out.

547
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,667
-Will you let me stay a little longer?
-Sure.

548
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,167
Thank you very much.

549
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,867
MERRY CHRISTMAS, KOTOKO

550
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,867
<i>I'm having dinner with Irie</i>

551
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,567
<i>on Christmas Eve!</i>

552
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:16,533
Oh, yeah.

553
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:47,733
I set it up for Jinko and Satomi.

554
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:03,867
Doesn't it feel like Christmas now?

555
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:06,333
Does it?

556
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:12,467
It's my...

557
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,700
first one since becoming a young adult.

558
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,867
Since...

559
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,833
my mom passed away
when I was young,

560
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:31,800
my dad was always busy

561
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:36,100
working at the restaurant
until midnight on Christmas.

562
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:41,433
Well, I went to parties with friends,
but...

563
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:47,867
I never actually spent

564
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:51,100
a Christmas with family before.

565
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
<i>Even if it was just a coincidence,</i>

566
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:03,067
<i>this was the most</i>
<i>Christmas-like Christmas</i>

567
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:06,467
<i>and I got to spend it with Irie.</i>

568
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,500
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

569
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:14,600
<i>I think this is the best</i>

570
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:18,400
<i>Christmas present I've ever received.</i>

571
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,967
<i>Love, love</i>

572
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:31,367
<i>Love, love, love</i>

573
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:32,700
-Satomi.
-Yeah?

574
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:36,833
Merry Christmas.

575
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,033
-No!
-It's real!

576
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,267
Welcome, can I help you?

577
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,967
-The Santa!
-What? Oh!

578
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,967
They're over here.

579
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:54,833
-There?
-Yes!

580
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,833
It's right over here.

581
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,533
There it is!

582
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,233
That was the last one,
you made it!

583
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,933
All right!

584
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,867
I'm going to go buy a cake.

585
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:12,367
We have to have cake on Christmas!

586
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,267
What a waste if we don't!

587
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,433
I'm sure they'll have it
at the convenience store.

588
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,867
I brought one.

589
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,600
The cake.

590
00:44:33,433 --> 00:44:35,100
Merry Christmas!

591
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,967
No way! Are you serious?

592
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:51,900
It's a present from Santa!

593
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:53,600
Of course not.

594
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:57,200
Then, you got this?

595
00:44:57,267 --> 00:44:58,867
Who else?

596
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:04,900
You knew I was going to be home,

597
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,800
so you got this for me?

598
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:10,400
You're excessively self-conscious.

599
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:12,600
A girl at work begged me

600
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:15,733
to buy the last cake because
she couldn't leave until it sold out.

601
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:36,400
Wait for me, Kotoko,
I'm bringing you a feast!

602
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,900
Merry Christmas!

603
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:50,400
Then let's make a wish.

604
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:53,667
-That's for birthdays.
-What?

605
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,633
Was it?

606
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,633
It's a surprise!

607
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:21,900
Thank you, Irie.

608
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,400
Whatever, it wasn't meant for you.

609
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:30,800
But this cake is the size for two.

610
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:33,967
It's a coincidence.

611
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,800
You get the Santa, Irie.

612
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,100
I don't care.

613
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:53,467
It looks dark in there.

614
00:47:05,067 --> 00:47:08,567
Hey, let's make a wish anyway.

615
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,133
Come on.

616
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,367
Then... you do it.

617
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:26,633
Are you sure?

618
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,733
-Are you getting married into the Iries?!
-Oh, stop it!

619
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,367
Congratulations on entering
your second year of college!

620
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:39,567
A new rival enrolled in our school!

621
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:41,933
You have to fight now.

622
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,933
Kotoko, I think you'd make a fine wife.

623
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,033
You would be the ideal bride!

624
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,767
I've had enough!
That's why I don't want to be here.

625
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:50,867
Irie!

626
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,133
Why didn't you tell your father?

627
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,033
Don't tell anyone yet.

628
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,733
{\an8}You want to be happy
with the one you love.

629
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,467
