1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,333
I'm Kotoko Aihara from class F.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,267
Would you read this?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,633
-I don't want it.
-How could he brake Kotoko's heart.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,767
He's challenging me.

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,133
It's okay.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,333
I'm giving up.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,533
When you change your home
your luck will change too.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,067
Something good will happen to you.

9
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,033
Wait, wait.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,300
Can you hear a weird noise?

11
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,133
Is that a shooting star?

12
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:29,533
Has it gotten hit by
a shooting star?

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,300
This is Iri-chan's home.

14
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:34,767
<i>After an unexpected turn of events,</i>
<i>I started living at my dad's</i>

15
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,433
<i>best friend's house.</i>
<i>My name is Kotoko Aihara.</i>

16
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,667
<i>But that house turned out to be...</i>

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,200
-What's wrong, Kotoko?
-Sorry to greet you late.

18
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>He's the boy who I admire:</i>

19
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,433
<i>Naoki Irie. It was his house.</i>

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,433
Don't tell anybody that we live together.

21
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,600
Don't talk to me at school either.

22
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,267
You don't have to say that much.

23
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,267
I don't like stupid girls.

24
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,733
<i>How humiliating.</i>

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,500
<i>I'll get my own back on him</i>

26
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,433
<i>for sure.</i>

27
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:09,367
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

28
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,367
{\an8}The bad season has come.

29
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,600
{\an8}LOVE EXAM

30
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,800
{\an8}Okay, this is

31
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,533
{\an8}the schedule
for the first trimester finals.

32
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,267
-What?
-Quiet.

33
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,567
Excuse me.

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,133
What's wrong, Aihara?
Do you have a stomachache?

35
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,700
I have a question.
In English that you teach,

36
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,433
have you decided on the range
of questions?

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,267
-What?
-Does it cover lesson 3 or 4?

38
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,200
She's gone nuts.

39
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,833
She's too serious.

40
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,433
Be quiet.

41
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,133
Let's go home, home, home.

42
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,767
What's going on, Kotoko?
You're different.

43
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,633
I can't forgive Naoki Irie.

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,333
-Good. Well said.
-So I'll do it this time.

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,800
I'll beat Naoki Irie on the finals.

46
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,500
You're laughing at me too.

47
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,700
You know,
Irie is always number one by far.

48
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,700
Not only that he's also number one
on the national test.

49
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,667
He's not the guy who you can beat.

50
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,133
-Right.
-Absolutely not.

51
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,700
Then I'll put my name
on the bulletin board.

52
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,333
On the same list as Naoki Irie
I'll put my name on it.

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,133
You're going to be in top 100?

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,400
No way. We're in class F, remember?

55
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,900
Right. Stop kidding

56
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,733
and let's go eat something
to give us energy. Let's go.

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,067
No.

58
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,067
History is there to change.

59
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,200
I'll get to the top 100

60
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,233
and put my name on
the bulletin board.

61
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,667
I'll change the history of class F.

62
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,067
Excuse me now.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,067
What's going on with Kotoko?

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
-Here they come.
-Looks good.

65
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,367
-There they are. Thank you.
-Oh, it looks delicious.

66
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,200
Let's eat.

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,100
The skin's got nice texture.

68
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:14,333
As expected, Kin-chan.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,767
I can trust you only
when it comes to food.

70
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,567
What do you mean by only food?

71
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,667
Master, you've got a great review.

72
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,867
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

73
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,600
This week's special,
Colombia is great as well.

74
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,500
Kotoko should have come with us.

75
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,867
Right.

76
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:33,400
What made her decide to be
in top 100 on the test?

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,633
Speaking of that,

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,167
don't you think that she's a little weird
after she moved?

79
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,800
You don't know what kind of area
she lives, right?

80
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:47,600
She said that she was able
to walk to school now.

81
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,133
That means... in Setagaya?

82
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,067
Shibuya?

83
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,700
It could be Meguro.

84
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,000
See, it's suspicious.

85
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,400
There's no way that she can live in
that kind of upscale neighborhood.

86
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,300
Because she's living lent-free.

87
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,033
Didn't she say that it was
her dad's friend's house?

88
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,367
-Right.
-Is that a true story?

89
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,400
She might be

90
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,533
treated badly in that house.

91
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,067
She says she's studying,
but the truth is,

92
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,167
she's being a maid and worked hard.

93
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,367
There's no such things
in these modern times.

94
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,000
Right. You freak.

95
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,567
He's a freak, right.

96
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,433
It's so funny. Isn't he a freak?

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,933
You're so stupid.

98
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,667
Something is fishy about it.

99
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,033
Thank you for this food.

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,833
Thank you for this food.

101
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,567
Anyway...

102
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,667
Ai-chan's store re-opened, right?

103
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,633
What a great news, Kotoko.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,900
Yes. Thanks to you all.

105
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,367
Thank you so much.

106
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,867
Not at all.

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,367
What kind of rice is this, honey?

108
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,433
This is not rice,
but it's a kind of pasta.

109
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,367
You're right.

110
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,667
<i>He's so handsome.</i>

111
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,833
You like it, huh?

112
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,967
I don't like stupid girls.

113
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,600
-Thank you for the meal.
-You don't have to hurry up and eat.

114
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,500
I'll have finals soon.

115
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,300
I have to study.

116
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,733
Excuse me now.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,267
Wow, she's so motivated.

118
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,400
Easy Math II Workbook

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,500
I don't know where I don't understand.

120
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,267
I'll study English first.

121
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:25,400
English.

122
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,467
Okay, it starts from here.

123
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,167
I should have listened better
during the class.

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,533
Okay.

125
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,500
I...

126
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:02,067
D...

127
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,833
D...

128
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,967
Well, this is...

129
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,967
With this pace,

130
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,700
it'll take 100 years

131
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,567
to be in top 100.

132
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,167
-Kotoko.
-Yes.

133
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,400
-May I come in?
-Yes.

134
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,700
Would you like to take a break?

135
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,800
Wow, thank you.

136
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,267
Help yourself.

137
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,100
Here they are.

138
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,733
Thank you.

139
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,233
-There.
-I'll eat them.

140
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,100
It looks so good.

141
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,533
It's delicious.

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm happy, too.

143
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,400
I wanted to do something like this.
I've been dreaming of it.

144
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,533
How about Irie?

145
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,833
Because he doesn't study.

146
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,867
What? Irie doesn't study?

147
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,533
How about now?

148
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,700
He went to bed already.

149
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,200
Irie is really a genius, isn't he.

150
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,833
I don't know if it's a good thing.

151
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,867
-Why?
-I can't explain it really well,

152
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:07,000
but if he stays like this, I feel like
he'll lose something important.

153
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,167
Irie is going to be okay.

154
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,567
He has such a wonderful family.

155
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,267
Thank you.

156
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,667
I know.

157
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,933
-Listen, Kotoko.
-Yes.

158
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,267
Do you want to see

159
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,167
the album of when he was little?

160
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,300
I want to see it.

161
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,967
Wait right here. I'll bring it for you.

162
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,500
The album...

163
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,733
Irie is asleep now, huh.

164
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,833
Here it is.

165
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,367
Let's see.

166
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,467
This is it.

167
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,367
Great.

168
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,167
My photo technique is a pro level.

169
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,967
I like it a lot.

170
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,400
But there are only few recent ones.

171
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,433
He doesn't like to get pictures taken.

172
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,467
Yuki copies him
and doesn't want it either.

173
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,167
I miss it.

174
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,633
Irie has been a good looking boy
since he was little.

175
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,033
I remember this.

176
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,500
<i>Receiving kind words</i>
<i>from upperclassmen</i>

177
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,767
<i>filled me with deep emotion.</i>

178
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,033
He's so little.

179
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,633
Who's this girl?

180
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,367
This is Naoki.

181
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,200
No way!

182
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,600
Isn't he cute?

183
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,933
I wanted to have a girl,

184
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,200
so I believed that the baby
would be a girl.

185
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,767
So I bought only girl's clothes.

186
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,467
Then I got carried away.

187
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,033
There was a time like this.

188
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,700
You're the first one to tell about this.

189
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,967
I never told Yuki either.

190
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,800
Naoki told me never to tell him.

191
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,133
Keep it secret between us.

192
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,200
Yes.

193
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,167
Then...

194
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,600
I'll give this to you for keeping secret.

195
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,433
Really? Thank you.

196
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,867
So cute.

197
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,667
Good morning.

198
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,700
-Good morning.
-Have a seat.

199
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,933
Good morning.

200
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:07,967
What's up, Kotoko?

201
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,833
Are you sick?

202
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,900
Nothing.

203
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:17,233
You must have studied so much
that you got crazy.

204
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,633
People fight meaninglessly.

205
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,167
The American Civil War, 1861.

206
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,100
The American Civil War, 1861.

207
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,767
People freed slaves.

208
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,467
People freed slaves, 1863.

209
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:47,567
1863, 1863...

210
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:48,967
Emancipation Proclamation.

211
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,400
1863, Emancipation Proclamation.

212
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,133
People freed meaningless slaves.

213
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Kotoko, you're serious about it,
aren't you?

214
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,067
People freed slaves.

215
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,200
People freed slaves.

216
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:05,133
The next one, Suez Canal, 1869.

217
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,700
Hey Kotoko, where do you live now?

218
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,033
Suez Canal...

219
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,867
1869, Suez Canal.

220
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,100
1869, Suez Canal.

221
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,367
She's gone crazy for sure.

222
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,967
Suez Canal, 1869.

223
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,667
Ms. Aihara.

224
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,500
Naoki Irie.

225
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,200
How could you come to see Kotoko?

226
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,033
Ms. Aihara, can you bring your bag
and come with me?

227
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,933
Yes.

228
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,933
Her bag?

229
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,600
Bring it with her?

230
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,933
-Why?
-What?

231
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,933
It couldn't be. That Irie guy

232
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,367
changes his mind and he might
tell her to go out.

233
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,700
No way.

234
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,933
Wait for me.

235
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,367
What is it?

236
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,433
This...

237
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,367
My mom switched accidentally.

238
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,033
-Right.
-Stuff like this,

239
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,633
if those idlers in your class see it,

240
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,033
it'll be a disaster.

241
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,700
They just exchanged something.

242
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,200
What does that mean?

243
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:46,000
There are so many things
that are inconveniencing me.

244
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,400
It's confusing when we're
in the same school.

245
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,900
Exactly.

246
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,833
You might accidentally wear
my uniform to come to school.

247
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:00,667
Why do I wear your uniform?

248
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,733
You grew up wearing skirts, right?

249
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:09,367
What are they talking about?
I can't hear anything.

250
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,333
Hush. They'll find us.

251
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,733
Ta-da!

252
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,933
Why do you have that?

253
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,933
Your mom gave it to me.

254
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,733
-What's that?
-Hold on.

255
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,267
Hush.

256
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,700
My mom did.

257
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,567
-Give it back to me.
-No way.

258
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,400
-Give it.
-No.

259
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,600
You've been bullying me.

260
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,133
It's my turn now.

261
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,667
A genius has a weakness also.

262
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,233
Is she trying to threaten me?

263
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,300
I can give it back to you.

264
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,767
But I have a condition.

265
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,433
For a week until finals,

266
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,933
teach me to study.

267
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Teach?

268
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,233
You?

269
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,800
How about this.
You make me get into top 100.

270
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,367
Then I'll return this photo to you.

271
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,767
-No, thanks.
-Why not?

272
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,500
The important thing is to sense
if possible or not.

273
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:04,767
By Philip Chesterfield.

274
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,867
Phi...Chi... What's that?

275
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,967
It means that it's a waste of time
to challenge something impossible.

276
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,633
It's impossible to put an idiot
like you into top 100.

277
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,000
-Then I'll show this to school.
-Wait, wait.

278
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,700
I got it.

279
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,833
I'll teach you for a week at night
starting today.

280
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,967
-All right.
-However...

281
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,267
I'm going to be strict
to achieve the goal.

282
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:33,367
Top 100 is usually filled
with classes A and B.

283
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,867
It's a miracle to put you in there
as a class F student.

284
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,733
See you this evening.

285
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,233
-Kotoko, are you okay?
-Kotoko.

286
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,100
Did he do anything to you?

287
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
What were you talking to Irie?

288
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,033
Nothing.

289
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,333
Okay.

290
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm going to study hard. Yeah.

291
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,967
Eat them up.
Yuki, don't leave anything on your plate.

292
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,667
Right. Kotoko,

293
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,633
kids' jobs are to eat.

294
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,200
-Eat well.
-Yes.

295
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,833
Eat this Daikon.
It absorbs the flavor, right?

296
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,767
It absorbed the flavor very well.

297
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>Irie and I, two of us are</i>
<i>going to study together.</i>

298
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,000
Kotoko, I'll make a snack for you
again tonight.

299
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,667
Thank you.

300
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,367
Mom, make two snacks, please.

301
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,300
Bring them to Kotoko's room.

302
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,133
Two?

303
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,733
Are you studying?

304
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,133
Right.

305
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,033
That's not fair.

306
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,433
Help me study too, brother.

307
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,667
You are okay.

308
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,567
-Let's start.
-Yes.

309
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,300
Thank you for the meal.

310
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,167
Come on in.

311
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,600
So, what do we start with?

312
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,133
What's the subject that you're bad at?

313
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,767
-Math, I think.
-Let's do that, then.

314
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:03,933
Okay. Math...

315
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Math is...

316
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,433
What section?

317
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,233
Isn't the section same as yours?

318
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,700
I don't know.

319
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,367
The section is...

320
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Where is it?

321
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,700
Here it is.

322
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,867
Until page 40.

323
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:45,267
Then the questions will be...

324
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,067
This and...

325
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,733
This and...

326
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,567
How do you know?

327
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,400
These are just summaries.

328
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:12,033
How do you study usually?

329
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,333
I remember it when I hear or read once.

330
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,400
I'll give you some questions.
You solve them.

331
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,533
You'll score 80 percent
if you can solve this.

332
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,867
What are you listening during class?

333
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:16,033
I want to see inside of your brain.

334
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,800
Sorry.

335
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,200
I wonder what's going on.

336
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,100
Naoki is studying with someone.

337
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,700
What made him change his mind?

338
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:40,767
I wonder if Kotoko is greater
than I thought she was.

339
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:42,500
In this short time,

340
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:46,400
-she changed him this much.
-Yeah.

341
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:50,333
That can be a good change for Naoki.

342
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,967
-Really? Do you think so too?
-Yeah.

343
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,700
Let's keep watching them.

344
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,967
Schedule

345
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,800
Do you have a tape?

346
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,200
Here.

347
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,733
You have to strictly follow this schedule.

348
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,733
Keep your notecards when
you're in bathroom or taking a shower.

349
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:27,867
Spartan!

350
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:28,967
Evil!

351
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,133
There's no time to chit-chat.

352
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:35,133
Let's review math formulas today.

353
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,233
It's after midnight, though.

354
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,967
N equal three.

355
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,900
And parenthesis

356
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:53,233
X minus, plus...

357
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:57,967
Minus five parenthesis, so...

358
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,767
"Until this point" is?

359
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:04,100
So far.

360
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,367
"Different way of saying" is?

361
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:07,933
In other words.

362
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,267
-On purpose?
-What?

363
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,733
-On purpose.
-On purpose?

364
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,800
Well...

365
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,200
Intentionally?

366
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:19,133
Intentionally.

367
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,400
I did it!

368
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,933
Phi... Phi... Phi...

369
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,067
Phi... Philip Chesterfield.

370
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:39,500
THE NIGHT BEFORE FINALS

371
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:43,167
I made the practice test. Solve them.

372
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,300
English

373
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,200
Great. I can come up with answers
left and right.

374
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,033
Do it quickly.

375
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,067
You have other subjects too.

376
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:00,233
Yes.

377
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,433
When you apply it here,
this becomes four.

378
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,300
What's the square of four?

379
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,300
-Sixteen.
-Right. So square root of 16 is...

380
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,600
So,

381
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:37,233
X equal square root of 1/2.

382
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,767
Okay. I did it.

383
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,000
Are you asleep?

384
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>Irie's</i>

385
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,067
<i>sleeping face.</i>

386
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,867
I got you snacks.

387
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:40,767
Good morning.

388
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,867
I made coffee. Would you like a cup?

389
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,333
Here.

390
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,600
I'm leaving now.

391
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,233
Kotoko, wait.

392
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,000
Here.

393
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,300
What's this?

394
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,933
Don't open it, yet.

395
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:04,167
After the test result comes out
and if you're in top 100, you can open it.

396
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,200
This is the lucky charm until then.

397
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,167
To Kotoko
Lucky Charm

398
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,500
Thank you.

399
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,567
You're overreacting on just finals.

400
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,133
Thank you so much.

401
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,533
-I'm going now.
-Okay. Have a wonderful day.

402
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,033
I did this.

403
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,567
I know differentiation.
Correlation is done.

404
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:31,900
Next,

405
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,467
Cosine is good. Sine is good too.

406
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,467
Double angle is good to go.

407
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:38,200
Okay. Perfect.

408
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,033
<i>At school,</i>

409
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,633
<i>I was told not to talk to him, but...</i>

410
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,533
Thank you.

411
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,133
Good luck.

412
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,900
You may start now.

413
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,967
I don't know this.

414
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,200
What do I do?

415
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:38,433
<i>This is the same problem</i>
<i>as Irie came up with.</i>

416
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,400
<i>So as this one...and this one,</i>
<i>and this one.</i>

417
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,967
Answer the questions below.

418
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,433
THREE DAYS LATER

419
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,900
We're done.

420
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,133
Let's go have some fun.

421
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,067
Good idea.

422
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,367
Me too, me too.

423
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,433
Let's go.

424
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,467
I'm not going to let you go.

425
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,400
-Let go.
-No, I won't.

426
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:19,500
You haven't cared about me lately
so I'm not letting you go today.

427
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,500
I give up.

428
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,400
Hey, where are you going?

429
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:26,100
Let me handle it. Let's go.

430
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,300
Yeah!

431
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,367
Why?

432
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:32,000
Isn't she the girl who had crash on you?

433
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,033
She's with another guy already.

434
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,167
It's none of my business.

435
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,733
I see. By the way...

436
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,500
Class A is having a get together

437
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:44,567
at a coffee shop too.
Do you want to come?

438
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,167
Well,

439
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,233
I guess you aren't coming.

440
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,433
No, actually I'll come today.

441
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,433
What? Really?

442
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,200
Isn't it the first time for you
to do that in these three years?

443
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,067
I thought it would be good sometimes.

444
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,267
Let's go. Hurry.

445
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:15,167
Number one is Irie.
He's got perfect score.

446
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,667
You're the second place again.

447
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:18,867
Excuse me.

448
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,267
Let's go.

449
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,800
Naoki Irie

450
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,067
Good for him.

451
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,133
Congratulations on your first place.

452
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,033
You've got the perfect score.

453
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,133
You, too, did it.

454
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,500
What?

455
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:57,867
Haven't you seen it?

456
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,267
No way.

457
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,100
The 100th place?

458
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,500
The 100th Place? No way.

459
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:16,900
Irie, I'm in the 100th place.
I did it. I'm so happy.

460
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:20,967
We did it.

461
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:22,633
That's not it.

462
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,667
Give that thing back to me.

463
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,933
This one, right?

464
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,233
Don't take it out in public.

465
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,833
Besides, I tell you again,

466
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,633
but don't talk to me at school.

467
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,167
Hey Irie.

468
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:48,000
The important thing is to sense
if it's possible or not.

469
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:51,700
If it's just difficult,
you only need to persevere.

470
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:54,033
Perseverance it is.

471
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,600
What?

472
00:37:55,767 --> 00:38:00,567
Spirit and perseverance
will get the better of the latter.

473
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,733
You know it, too.

474
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,000
The rest of some Chesterfield's quote.

475
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,767
Of course.

476
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:17,767
Irie, thank you.

477
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,667
<i>My name is on</i>

478
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,633
<i>the same paper as Irie is.</i>

479
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,167
<i>I did it.</i>

480
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,433
That's her. Ms. Aihara in class F.

481
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,133
The girl in the middle.

482
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,167
She's in top 100.

483
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,333
Great.

484
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,733
She's the brightest one since
class F started.

485
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,967
Really.

486
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,133
You finally became famous
on something good.

487
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,967
We're proud to be with you.

488
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,500
You're smiling too much.

489
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,967
I feel so good.

490
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,767
It's suspicious.

491
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,033
It's completely suspicious.

492
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:14,467
I knew it from the beginning.

493
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,733
In her new home,

494
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,133
there's some kind of secret.

495
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,100
-See you.
-See you tomorrow.

496
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,633
-Bye.
-Stay safe.

497
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,100
Bro, don't we stand out even more?

498
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,633
Idiot, it's important to go
with the looks first.

499
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,067
-Right.
-Okay.

500
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:50,467
-Let's go now.
-Yes.

501
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,767
The sunset

502
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,433
feels so good.

503
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,700
It's done.

504
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:23,833
That's it.

505
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:29,133
In this kind of upscale neighborhood
is not where she can afford.

506
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,500
She must be worked hard as a maid
by some rich guy.

507
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,533
-Right?
-I agree.

508
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,633
-Poor thing.
-She is.

509
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,933
Bro, look.

510
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,100
{\an8}Irie.

511
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,833
What's Irie?

512
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
{\an8}It says Irie here.

513
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,767
{\an8}-Irie?
-Yes.

514
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,700
{\an8}-What's this then?
-Family.

515
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,067
{\an8}It means Irie Family.

516
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,300
{\an8}Irie Family?

517
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,567
Irie?

518
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:58,367
Well, but,

519
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:01,167
a last name like Irie
is all over the country.

520
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,633
-Right.
-I agree.

521
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,267
-You're right.
-I think so too.

522
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:05,967
No kidding.

523
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,100
Bro, over there.

524
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,367
It's Irie.

525
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:13,967
Let's hide.

526
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,767
-Where?
-Over there.

527
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,133
No...

528
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,100
No way.

529
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:32,800
It can't be.

530
00:41:58,267 --> 00:41:59,767
Bro!

531
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:02,567
Tonan University Senior High School

532
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,367
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

533
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:06,333
Kotoko!

534
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:10,933
Kotoko.

535
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,067
Kotoko.

536
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,900
Kotoko, Kotoko.

537
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,100
Kotoko, the house that you live...

538
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,133
Is it Naoki Irie's house?

539
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
What?

540
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:26,200
There's no way.

541
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:30,367
But I saw you go into his house
with my own eyes.

542
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:32,400
Gintaro and Dozo are witnesses too.

543
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,033
-I did see it.
-I did see it.

544
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,967
You must have had a dream
or something.

545
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:41,300
Because how can I live with Irie.

546
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,900
-But we saw it, didn't we?
-No!

547
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:47,333
-Oh, my.
-I saw it.

548
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,600
-Dream? No way.
-I saw it.

549
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,333
It can't be. It's a dream.

550
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,967
Dear Kotoko, lucky charm?

551
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,467
Don't say things like that.

552
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:00,400
-It's not a dream.
-It's not a dream, right?

553
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:02,133
Wait a minute.

554
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,133
What's this picture?

555
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,433
What?

556
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,267
Is this a two-shot with Irie?

557
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:13,567
Wait, Kotoko. What does this mean?

558
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,233
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,800
As I thought,
you're living at Irie's house?

560
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:30,867
Well, but it's not something
that you're thinking about.

561
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:37,467
Well, both dads are best friends
and our house was broken, right?

562
00:43:37,633 --> 00:43:41,267
So until we find a next house,

563
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,100
we're staying with them. Yeah.

564
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:47,333
That means the test this time...

565
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,967
Did Irie teach you?

566
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,767
No wonder.

567
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:53,800
I couldn't get your good grade
this time.

568
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,633
-That's what was going on.
-He made Kotoko make the 100th.

569
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,133
Irie is a genius for sure.

570
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,100
I'm relieved. It must have not been
Kotoko's own ability.

571
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,200
Wait, everyone. That's too harsh.

572
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:05,900
I got it.

573
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,867
Okay.

574
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,767
But these two have good vibes.

575
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:18,067
When they live under
the same roof...

576
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,933
Stop saying such stupid things.

577
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,300
I want to know.

578
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,067
That's never happening.

579
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,800
Because Irie is ignoring me.

580
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,067
He hates me.

581
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:37,633
Kotoko, poor thing.

582
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,500
Jinko.

583
00:44:42,267 --> 00:44:47,700
But I don't like such a cold person.

584
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,600
I'm okay.

585
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:51,933
But I'm told

586
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,333
not to tell anybody
about living together, at school.

587
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,867
Everyone, please keep this secret
for now.

588
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,133
Okay. Count on us.

589
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,333
-Right everyone?
-Yeah.

590
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,700
Thank you.

591
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:11,100
You are so kind.

592
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:21,333
<i>These two have good vibes.</i>

593
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:20,733
Aihara.

594
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:23,200
-What?
-Come with me.

595
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:31,367
We're not supposed to talk
at school, are we?

596
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Extra! Extra!

597
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,033
Naoki and Kotoko are living together.

598
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,767
A big scoop on Naoki Irie
and Kotoko Aihara.

599
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:45,667
Extra!

600
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,767
Those two.

601
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:54,900
Jinko and Satomi are...

602
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:56,767
What are your friends thinking?

603
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:07,167
-Take one.
-Please do.

604
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,100
-Please.
-Take one.

605
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,467
Hey, did we do the right thing?

606
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:14,967
Trust me. We have to clear the decks
for her love.

607
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,967
Well said, Jinko.

608
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:20,300
It's the scoop between Naoki Irie
and Kotoko Aihara.

609
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,500
Irie.

610
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:32,567
I'm sorry.

611
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,133
I'm so sorry.

612
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:39,600
You wrote me a love letter

613
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,533
so you wouldn't mind it
to get rumors like this,

614
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,067
but it's a nuisance to me.

615
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:51,533
Don't put me off
from my pace anymore.

616
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:10,433
I...

617
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,833
am crying. Why?

618
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,767
Home cooked meal, huh.

619
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,667
NEXT EPISODE

620
00:49:57,733 --> 00:50:00,900
If she stays like this,
will she be able to get married?

621
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:03,667
It'll be nice if Kotoko is Naoki's bride.

622
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,067
What's this?

623
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,233
Marriage is out of question.

624
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Say that clearly.

625
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,667
-What did you do to me?
-It's terrible.

626
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,500
You can't lose.
You have to beat Irie

627
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,633
to be with Kotoko all the time.

628
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,700
I don't know people's mind.
Even if I don't like someone today,

629
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,067
{\an8}I might like her tomorrow.

630
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:24,433
{\an8}What are you doing?

631
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,467
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
