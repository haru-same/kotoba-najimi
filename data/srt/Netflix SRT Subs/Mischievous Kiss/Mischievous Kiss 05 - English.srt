1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,333
I'm glad that we can all attend
Tonan University.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,733
Congratulations.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,167
If you go to Tokyo University,
your parents will be proud of you.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,733
You've only brought me troubles.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,167
-Are you okay?
-How about your entrance exam?

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,367
I didn't take it.

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm really sorry.
Because of my daughter,

8
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,100
your precious son had to ruin his future.

9
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:28,833
Let me be clear. It's not your fault that
I didn't take the entrance exam.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,133
I felt that it would be nice for me
to go to Tonan with others.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,167
You mean you want to go
to the college with me?

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,933
That's not what I meant.

13
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,167
<i>After many twists and turns,</i>

14
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:49,367
<i>Irie has decided to go to Tonan University</i>

15
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:52,400
<i>with me.</i>

16
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,300
<i>It's March.</i>

17
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:59,933
<i>It's time to say goodbye to Tonan High</i>
<i>School where we spent three years.</i>

18
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:02,833
<i>That's right.</i>

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,567
<i>Our graduation is getting closer.</i>

20
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,767
8 DAYS TO GRADUATION CEREMONY

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,500
You have only eight days
until the graduation ceremony.

22
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:15,100
Soon you have to say goodbye
to your friends,

23
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,967
with whom you spent three years together.

24
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,700
What's wrong? C'mon. Cheer up.

25
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, what's the matter?
Hello, Class F?

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,600
Finally we all know which university
we are attending.

27
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,000
Many in this class do not go to Tonan,
unlike other classes.

28
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,300
I will miss you all.

29
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,100
Many? Tell the truth.
I'm the only one to stay with Tonan.

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,900
That's true.
I don't mean to make you feel bad.

31
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,500
Are you really sure about your choice?

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
If I really want to go to Tokyo
University, I can try again next year.

33
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,733
That's right.

34
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,767
I'm sure that you will be accepted
if you apply.

35
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:08,233
Watanabe, Waseda is your first choice.
Congratulations.

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,333
Thank you.

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,033
Irie is really staying with Tonan.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,233
I'm shocked.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,900
I've heard that he missed the entrance
exam of Tokyo University on purpose.

40
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:23,900
Why?

41
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:28,267
Don't tell me that it's because the girl
in Class F goes to Tonan.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,233
Soon we will be a high school graduate.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,733
Kotoko, you must make special memories
with Irie before the graduation.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,900
Not really. We are going
to the same college anyway.

45
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,700
What's wrong with you?
Our high school life will be over soon.

46
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,867
It's a perfect time to get closer to him.

47
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,933
Irie goes to Tonan,
because she goes there.

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,633
Everyone is guessing so.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,233
I can't believe it.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
What is he thinking?

51
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,633
You two get together at the graduation.

52
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,667
I'm blushing.

53
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,500
At least you should get a kiss.

54
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,867
That's good.

55
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,433
To commemorate the graduation,

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,733
you should have the first kiss.

57
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,600
Stop it. It is not going to happen.

58
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,067
Do you know a legend of this school?

59
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:25,667
A couple who kisses on the
graduation day stays together forever.

60
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,233
-Really?
-I've heard about that.

61
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:33,167
But I don't know if Kotoko has a chance.

62
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,133
You may be right.

63
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,733
You may be right. A kiss?

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,700
The first

65
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,233
kiss?

66
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,133
<i>It is</i>

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,433
<i>a special kiss which you can experience</i>

68
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:53,733
<i>only once in your life.</i>

69
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,900
<i>I have been longing</i>

70
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,467
<i>for the first kiss for a long time.</i>

71
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,967
<i>But I didn't expect</i>

72
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,300
<i>that it would happen in that way.</i>

73
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:10,367
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

74
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,133
{\an8}-What do you wear for a graduation party?
-A suit jacket or jeans?

75
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,833
{\an8}WHO WILL GET THE FIRST KISS!?

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,433
{\an8}Three of you are organizers of this party,
huh?

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,800
{\an8}That's right.
We haven't picked the venue yet.

78
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,967
But we really want you to come.

79
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,067
Of course I will.

80
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,467
All of you studied so hard.
I'm proud of you.

81
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,833
I really congratulate you
on your graduation.

82
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Thanks.

83
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:35,667
We are so glad that everyone
of Class F was able to graduate.

84
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,900
We will make our party the best.
Right, teacher?

85
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,600
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

86
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,267
But a student doesn't

87
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,867
want to attend the graduation ceremony.

88
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,067
What?

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Didn't you hear

90
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,267
about Kinnosuke Ikezawa?

91
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,433
Kin-chan?

92
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,567
Now I realize

93
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,833
that he is absent today.

94
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:09,700
Are you saying that he can't graduate?

95
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,800
It's possible.

96
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,633
He always fails...

97
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,933
Wait. He got enough units to graduate.

98
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,700
He can graduate, but...

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,733
Hi, Kin-chan.

100
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,733
Kotoko. How do you find me?

101
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,400
Gintaro and Dozo told me.

102
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,100
Idiots! They shouldn't have told you.

103
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:07,833
Kin-chan.

104
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,367
Let's attend the graduation ceremony
together.

105
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,833
Both Gintaro and Dozo
are so worried about you.

106
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
They told you everything, right?

107
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,767
I got rejected by Tonan University.

108
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,100
But you are not the only one

109
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,500
who was rejected in our class.

110
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,500
Gintaro and Dozo go
to a technical school. Right?

111
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,700
You know what?

112
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,867
I came to Tokyo from Osaka,

113
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,633
hoping to do something big.

114
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,467
Something big? Like what?

115
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,333
I don't know that yet.

116
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,433
But you only live once.

117
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,667
Every man would like to do something big,

118
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,133
to marry a perfect girl,

119
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,933
and to have a perfect family.

120
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,367
To accomplish these,

121
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,767
I convinced myself to go
to the biggest city in Japan.

122
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,433
I came to Tokyo by myself.

123
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,567
But I failed.

124
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,633
How could I compete

125
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,300
with Irie?

126
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,800
Why Irie?

127
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,133
You know why.

128
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:01,833
I declared defiantly that I loved you
more than anyone.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,500
But now I can't even go to a college.

130
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,767
Irie gave up Tokyo University

131
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:13,567
to attend Tonan University with you.

132
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,467
Not exactly.

133
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,200
I keep on losing to him.

134
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,767
I'm disappointed by myself.

135
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,367
College education
won't determine your value.

136
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,833
Remember?

137
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,900
I'm sure I told you about this.

138
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:52,633
My father and Irie's father
are the best friends, right?

139
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,300
Irie's father is

140
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:00,900
a graduate of Tokyo University.

141
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,333
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>He started his own business</i>

143
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,667
<i>and developed it into a big corporation.</i>

144
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,667
On the other hand, my father didn't even
attend a high school.

145
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,067
<i>Right after graduating the middle school,</i>
<i>he became an apprentice to a chef.</i>

146
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,967
You know that, right?

147
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,133
But they like each other so much.

148
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,800
They respect each other's profession.

149
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,600
If they didn't, you guys
wouldn't have a place to live now.

150
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,000
He wouldn't invite you into his house.

151
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,733
I know.

152
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,100
What I'm trying to say is...

153
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:03,933
you and I are not good at academic stuff,

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,867
but we can find something we are good at.

155
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,467
Something I'm good at?

156
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,900
Find something big, something that only
you can accomplish.

157
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey.

158
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
If I find it and become successful,

159
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,000
will you fall in love with me?

160
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,333
Well, that's another issue.

161
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,733
Well...

162
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,433
As Irie said, nobody knows

163
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,667
what will happen next.

164
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,933
"I don't like her today,
but I may like her tomorrow."

165
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,667
I don't mean that I dislike you.

166
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,633
You are my friend. That's all.

167
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
That's fine for now.

168
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,633
I will find something I'm good at

169
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,867
and become the best of it.

170
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,433
Kotoko, wait for me until then.

171
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,900
Will you come
to the graduation ceremony?

172
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,133
Okay.

173
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,100
I will attend it with head held high.

174
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,567
Grades do not determine my value.

175
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,367
I won't lose to Irie, no matter what.
I will be a big shot.

176
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's make the graduation ceremony
great together.

177
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,733
-Okay. Let's make great memories.
-Yes.

178
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,733
Miss, what can I get for you?

179
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,033
Well...

180
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Let's see...

181
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,200
Mandhe...ling?

182
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,633
Sure.

183
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,333
It's called Mandheling coffee.

184
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,267
-Kotoko.
-Yes?

185
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,200
What's that?

186
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,067
I will miss you.

187
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,333
I will miss you, too.

188
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:16,467
I will miss you, but we have to move on.

189
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,867
Hey!

190
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,633
Kin-chan is back.

191
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,900
Bro!

192
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,200
Kin-chan, have you gotten over it?

193
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,233
-"Gotten over it"? What do you mean?
-About college.

194
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,033
Jinko, shut your mouth.

195
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,300
No, no, no.

196
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:40,333
I've decided to become a man
earlier than you can.

197
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,733
And I will be ready for...

198
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,033
C'mon, Kotoko.

199
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:47,600
That's my goal.

200
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:50,900
I got it. Instead of going to a college,
he will get a job.

201
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:53,267
Kin-chan, you are very positive.

202
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,833
Or I would say "happy-go-lucky."

203
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,267
I'm glad to see you in the graduation
ceremony with us.

204
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,533
Thanks. By the way,

205
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,567
you are the organizers of the party,
right?

206
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:09,733
That's right. Jinko and I were just
debating which restaurant we should pick.

207
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,100
Our budget is very small,
so we don't have many options.

208
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:20,067
Butalian? No, this place isn't good.

209
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:22,100
I will help you organize this party.

210
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,600
I will make it the best. Trust me.

211
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,233
What do you think?

212
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
Well...

213
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,500
We can trust your judgment
only about food.

214
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,400
"Only about food"?
What are you trying to say?

215
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,433
Kin-chan, thank you for your help.

216
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,567
Listen up, everyone.

217
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,500
I will make

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,367
our last night of high school
the most memorable one.

219
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,067
Just "wash your face" and wait.
I will show you.

220
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,000
If you want to use the old proverb,
it is "wash your neck."

221
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,067
Neck. "Wash your neck."

222
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,933
Just "wash your neck" and wait.
I will show you.

223
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,367
Yeah!

224
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,667
Let's wash our face, too.

225
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,167
Sure. Wash your face, too.

226
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
GRADUATION DAY

227
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,500
You look so cute, Kotoko. Smile.

228
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,933
Good.

229
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:23,767
Give me upturned eyes.

230
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,200
Imagine that the camera is my son.

231
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,967
Stop it.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,800
Go behind the chair.

233
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,500
And do like this.

234
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,733
That's right. That's right.

235
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,300
Ready? Say cheese.
So cute.

236
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,533
You are so cute.

237
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,233
Now sit here and lean to your left.

238
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,767
Just like that.

239
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,133
Are you ready?

240
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,600
You are so cute. I love this shot.

241
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,967
This is the last day

242
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,767
I can see you in the uniform.

243
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,400
C'mon, Dad.

244
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,067
I got enough interior shots.

245
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,600
Now let's go outside.

246
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:03,867
Good timing.

247
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,867
This is a memorable day.

248
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:09,300
Let's take a photo of you two.

249
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,100
He wouldn't do that, of course.

250
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,500
You want to take a photo or not?

251
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,367
Kotoko, this must be your lucky day.

252
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,600
Let's go.

253
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,267
I'm coming.

254
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,033
Are you ready?

255
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,200
Get closer.

256
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,833
C'mon, guys.

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,967
Closer.

258
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,800
That's it. You look great.

259
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,167
You have bread crumb on your face.

260
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,367
Since this is the last day,
can we walk together?

261
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,267
Anyway...

262
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:13,333
Time flies. Don't you think?

263
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,367
This is our last day of high school.

264
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,333
In the last three years,

265
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:39,300
this is the best year for me.

266
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:45,800
This was the most painful year
in my 18-year life.

267
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,567
They come together again.

268
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,467
Bro, you should do something.

269
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,667
He

270
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,767
gave up Tokyo University,
because of Kotoko.

271
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,400
Kotoko is worth it.

272
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,300
I admit that Irie has a good taste.

273
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,233
Well,

274
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,700
the stronger my rival is,

275
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,133
the more I get motivated.

276
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:24,333
I have a brilliant plan.

277
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,300
Plan?

278
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,767
After the graduation party,

279
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,133
Kotoko and I will...

280
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,367
What?

281
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,667
We will kiss.

282
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,567
Kiss?

283
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,033
Kiss?

284
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,133
Kiss! Everyone can hear you.

285
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,067
-Sorry.
-Kiss?

286
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,300
Shut up. Shut up.

287
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,667
Shut up. Shut up.

288
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,700
Let's go.

289
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,367
Guys.

290
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,400
Have you heard a legend of this school?

291
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,267
A legend?

292
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,500
A couple who kisses
on the graduation day

293
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:09,833
will stay together forever.

294
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,400
-I know. I know.
-That's why you are planning to...

295
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,400
That's right.

296
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,167
Kotoko and I will

297
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,900
vow eternal love.

298
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,000
But how?

299
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,767
-Are you going to force her...
-That's not good.

300
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,167
I wouldn't do that.

301
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,867
I told you.

302
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:33,367
I have a brilliant plan.

303
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,833
A brilliant plan?

304
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,567
What is it?

305
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,033
Kotoko will be stunned by my love.

306
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,267
Too loud. Everyone can hear you.

307
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,100
-Bro!
-Good morning. Good morning.

308
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,567
Presentation of a diploma.

309
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:52,300
High school diploma.
Naoki Irie.

310
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,433
This diploma proves that this person

311
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,400
has finished the general education
curriculum at Tonan High School.

312
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,800
Congratulations.

313
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,967
Kotoko Aihara.

314
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,800
Jinko Komori.

315
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,867
Satomi Ishikawa.

316
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,133
Kinnosuke Ikezawa.

317
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:37,967
Kin-chan!

318
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:23,533
This is it.
Our high school years are over.

319
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Kotoko!

320
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,900
Kotoko, is that Irie's mother?

321
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,367
Hi, Mrs. Irie.

322
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,167
Thank you for coming today.

323
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,000
Congratulations.

324
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:46,500
Both my husband and your father
had to leave for their work.

325
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,367
That's good.

326
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,800
My father must have been
very emotional.

327
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:53,633
I would cry

328
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,400
if I saw him crying.

329
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:57,667
Of course, he has a right

330
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:01,933
to be emotional. This is the graduation
day of his only daughter.

331
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
I can't help crying, too.

332
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,967
Kotoko, you look like

333
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,000
a real member of Irie family.

334
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,233
Of course.

335
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,900
I have not given up my hope

336
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:20,167
that you will become my daughter-in-law.

337
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,467
Look.

338
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,367
Wow, this makes the graduation
ceremony more memorable.

339
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:35,167
You are a cool parent.

340
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,000
A life full of love is so cool.

341
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:40,400
Look over there.

342
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,067
If you want mine.

343
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:48,033
It's the second button.

344
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:52,333
This reminds me of my youth.

345
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,633
But our uniform has only two buttons.

346
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,700
Happy to get someone's button?

347
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,800
It only happens on the graduation day.

348
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:07,033
I'm jealous. I wish...

349
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,833
Listen, Kotoko.

350
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,700
What are you doing?

351
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,900
You are a new graduate, too.

352
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:16,933
Take the plunge and tell my son
about your feelings.

353
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,700
That's right. You have permission
from Irie's mother.

354
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,667
You won't get a more powerful
endorsement than this.

355
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,333
Well, yes, but...

356
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,133
Speak of the devil.

357
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,933
Your love interest attracts
a lot of attention.

358
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,433
-Can I have your second button?
-Request denied.

359
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,667
Will you take a picture with me?

360
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,000
Request denied.

361
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,833
Sorry. Excuse us.

362
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,433
Sorry.

363
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,833
I didn't know that he had
such a large number of fans.

364
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Unlike you, they know
that they don't have a chance,

365
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,933
so they have remained
as a secret admirer.

366
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,767
Since this is the last day,
they can't hide their emotion anymore.

367
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:04,700
This is exactly what I thought.

368
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:11,467
I believe he likes you, Kotoko.

369
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:15,967
He is keeping his second button
for you.

370
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:19,067
I don't think so.

371
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,533
I am his mother.

372
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,967
I know exactly what he has in his mind.

373
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:31,367
-Kotoko, go.
-What?

374
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,200
This is our last day of high school.

375
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,800
That's right. You should make
a long-lasting memory.

376
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,467
-Go.
-Go.

377
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:38,967
Go!

378
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,233
Go.

379
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,567
<i>What if</i>

380
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,533
<i>I can get Irie's second button?</i>

381
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,700
Hi, Irie.

382
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,933
Congratulations on your graduation.

383
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,400
If you don't mind,
can I have your second button?

384
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,067
-Sure.
-What?

385
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,567
Cool!

386
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,633
<i>Does this mean</i>

387
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,433
<i>that I'm</i>

388
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,167
<i>his special girl?</i>

389
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,300
Irie.

390
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,733
The button.

391
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,200
Well...

392
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,933
Well, Irie...

393
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,967
If you don't mind, can I have your--

394
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,633
Request denied.

395
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,233
Sorry, Kotoko. I'm really sorry.

396
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,300
Even after graduating high school,

397
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,467
he still has no interest in girls.

398
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:44,500
You still have a rocky road ahead of you.

399
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,567
Bro, everyone loves your fried noodle.

400
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:05,600
It will capture Kotoko's heart for sure.

401
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,967
I know that.

402
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,733
Everyone will come soon.

403
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,633
Oh, no.

404
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,133
Why is there a partition here?
Can I remove it?

405
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,833
We have to share this room
with another group.

406
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,533
They have made reservation first,
so we have to live with it.

407
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,467
This is the graduation season.

408
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:31,400
In this neighborhood, this is the largest
venue as far as I know.

409
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,900
And we have your fried noodle.

410
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,833
That's right.

411
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:39,633
Put the fried noodle in the middle.

412
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,900
Put it in the middle.

413
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,333
Here you go.

414
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,333
But your best card is that,

415
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,833
isn't it?

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,667
GOODBYE, CLASS F

417
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,167
I know it.

418
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,433
This stage is your secret weapon.

419
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,167
I'm impressed, Gintaro.

420
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,833
That makes it easy.

421
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,267
What are you talking about?

422
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,000
You are too slow.

423
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,467
We are talking about "it."

424
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,967
He and Kotoko will...

425
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,133
The kiss, huh?

426
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,633
Aren't you excited?

427
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,933
Besides, don't say the word.
I'm embarrassed.

428
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,867
-I'm embarrassed.
-You are embarrassed.

429
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,000
In all ages,

430
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:27,633
the same thing captures girls' heart.

431
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,767
Which is?

432
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,800
<i>A song</i>

433
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:45,500
<i>A song</i>

434
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:48,967
Test. Mike test.

435
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:55,567
I will dedicate a beautiful love song

436
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,333
to Kotoko.

437
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,200
Then it will

438
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,433
melt Kotoko's heart.

439
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,167
Kin-chan.

440
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,967
I'm sorry for having turned down
your love for a long time.

441
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,667
I don't know why,
but I didn't find you attractive.

442
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:16,567
Instead, I was in love with such a jerk.

443
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:20,667
I was such an idiot.

444
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,200
Don't cry.

445
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,200
What's going on?

446
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Kin-chan, here we are.

447
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,600
C'mon. You interrupt my fantasy.

448
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,867
Fried noodle looks delicious.

449
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:07,033
Kin-chan, thank you so much.

450
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,933
Can we eat it now?

451
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,167
Sure. Eat as much as you can.
I did the best.

452
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,900
Thank you.

453
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,433
My favorite fried noodle.

454
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,433
Bon appetite.

455
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,567
Kin-chan's fried noodle is the best.

456
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,867
Is that right?

457
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,067
Hey, Kotoko.

458
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,300
You have green dried seaweed
on your face.

459
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,100
It won't come off.

460
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,300
It won't come off.

461
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,900
Irie?

462
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:47,633
Class F?

463
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,500
Why is Class F here?

464
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,933
Oh, no...

465
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,367
You are the ones who have reserved
the other half?

466
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,600
Move quickly.

467
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:08,100
GOODBYE, CLASS F
KEEP IN TOUCH

468
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,000
Hi, everyone.

469
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:16,167
Let's start the graduation party of
Tonan High School Class F.

470
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,133
Look around.

471
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,867
We have plenty of food and drink,
which I prepared.

472
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,100
Have a pleasant chat
while enjoying the food.

473
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,967
Wow, it looks awesome.

474
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,567
So gorgeous.

475
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,133
Look at that. Spectacular.

476
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,600
What kind of cuisine is that?

477
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,233
What kind of cuisine?

478
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,167
I think it's Chinese.

479
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,000
Chinese?

480
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,633
What?

481
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,200
What's going on?

482
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,300
It's amazing.

483
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,700
I like this.

484
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,233
It's catering from Robuchon of Ebisu.

485
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,233
-Robuchon? The famous restaurant?
-Yes.

486
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,000
My father is a good friend of the chef.

487
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,433
Really? Wow.

488
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,833
-Lucky you, Watanabe.
-It's nothing.

489
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,700
What a shame! Class A got everything,
while Class F got nothing.

490
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,333
That's true.

491
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,867
I love this fried noodle.

492
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,867
This sausage is also delicious.
Eat it, everyone.

493
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,533
I will try this one, too.

494
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,300
Right. Let's have fun here.

495
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,167
Let's eat, everyone.

496
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:48,100
This is awesome.

497
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,367
Hey, listen.

498
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,567
Well...

499
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,067
A star of this graduation party

500
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:09,267
is not us or the food.
It's our teacher.

501
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,333
Mr. Shibukawa.

502
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,367
Thank you for teaching us

503
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,367
for three long years.

504
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,533
Can you make a speech for us?

505
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,100
We want your speech.

506
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,967
Hello, everyone of Class F.

507
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,033
Congratulations on your graduation.

508
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:54,000
I know you were discriminated,
just because you were in Class F.

509
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,300
But

510
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,833
you fought back.

511
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,700
I fought with you all for three years.

512
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:07,567
I'm really proud of what
we've done together.

513
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,900
It has been a privilege

514
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:13,267
for me to educate a group
of such high-achievers

515
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:15,733
for three years.

516
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:22,467
Waseda, Keio, Sophia and others.

517
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,933
Many of you are accepted
to highly competitive universities.

518
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm so proud of you guys.

519
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,767
Without your help,

520
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:40,967
we wouldn't be able to earn
such high grades.

521
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,433
You are flattering me.

522
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,100
I want to make it clear.

523
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:55,733
Go ahead.

524
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,333
Academic success should not be a sole
goal of young people.

525
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,533
Agree.

526
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,700
You shouldn't be measured only
with grades at school.

527
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,667
Yeah!

528
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,767
If you don't have good grades,

529
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:14,567
it's no easy to get a college education

530
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,833
as well as to get a job.

531
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,233
I'm so happy that

532
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,133
I don't need to see you

533
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,733
go through such hardships.

534
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,567
Applause.

535
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,700
Hey!

536
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,067
You are smart. So what?

537
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,767
Well.

538
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:46,300
I wasn't talking about Class F.

539
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:50,533
I guess you are very sensitive
about grades, huh? I wonder why.

540
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,967
That's why I don't like underachievers.

541
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:00,900
They tend to have a victim mentality.

542
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,100
-What did you say?
-And to appeal to the violence.

543
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,133
What? I haven't done anything violent yet.

544
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,533
A verbal abuse can be prosecuted.
You know that?

545
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:19,100
Can you guys compete against us

546
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,833
in anything but the physical strength?

547
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,867
-Kin-chan.
-Bro.

548
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:37,233
Kin-chan.

549
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,733
Kobayakawa, I am proud of you.

550
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,333
Thank you, sir.

551
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,433
I'm sorry, but all the other rooms
are booked.

552
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,033
I understand, but can you do something?
This is our last night of high school.

553
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,667
We can't have fun in the same room
with such jerks.

554
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,333
But there is nothing I can do.

555
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,633
Kin-chan.

556
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,033
Kotoko, I'm trying to get another room.

557
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,800
-I'm telling you--
-We don't need another room.

558
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,633
-Let's go.
-But Kotoko...

559
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,333
Let's go, Kin-chan.

560
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,967
The teachers just lost their cool, because
they had some alcoholic drink.

561
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,667
Let's have fun together.

562
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,400
You've promised me.

563
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,233
We will find something we are good at.

564
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,100
Anything other than studying.

565
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,100
If you believe in that,

566
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:44,100
you won't care whatever Class A
says about us.

567
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,067
You are right.

568
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:12,700
I guess

569
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,467
I lost my cool.

570
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,933
Thank you for making me realize that.

571
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,267
Kotoko.

572
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:45,467
You have green dried seaweed
on your face again.

573
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,233
Allow me.

574
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,333
Bro...

575
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:08,633
Naoki Irie.

576
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,933
Well, I have to go back to my friends.

577
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:27,233
What do you want, Mr. Genius?

578
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:32,633
Did you come to check
what Kotoko and I were doing?

579
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:37,200
Are you jealous?

580
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,200
Hey, are you ignoring me? Stop.

581
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,100
While you are enjoying a college life,

582
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:49,667
I will do something big
and become a big shot.

583
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,767
I've promised Kotoko that I will do that.

584
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,367
That would sound cool
if you were accepted to a college.

585
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:59,000
Since you were rejected
by all the colleges,

586
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,367
that sounds just sour grapes.

587
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,600
That's not the only thing
I have promised Kotoko.

588
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:10,167
Tonight I will kiss...

589
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,033
I will kiss Kotoko.

590
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,267
If you want to have a dream,
go to bed.

591
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,567
You will see.

592
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:26,033
Kotoko is the one who wants
to have a great celebration party.

593
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:31,700
At the end of high school,
finally she realized

594
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:36,300
who cared about her most.

595
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,000
You are jealous now? It's too late.

596
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,333
Understand, Mr. Genius?

597
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,767
Attention please!

598
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,933
Hello, Class A.

599
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,900
Hello, Class F.

600
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:19,433
Let's have fun together.
This is our last night of high school.

601
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,667
Good idea.

602
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:23,300
Why don't we share dishes
with each other?

603
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,867
Good idea. Let's do that.

604
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:28,433
Come over here.

605
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:42,367
Of course, you are excited.

606
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,767
You've got everything you want.

607
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,133
Irie cannot go to Tokyo University,

608
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,900
because of you.

609
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:54,433
Because you are dumb, you have a right
to drag someone excellent down?

610
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,200
Unbelievable. You are so pathetic.

611
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,967
It's not her fault.

612
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:11,600
It's not her fault
that I don't go to Tokyo University.

613
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:15,167
-Irie.
-What?

614
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,167
-You are not a complete jerk, huh?
-It will change my view on you.

615
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:25,533
Why on earth should I give up going to
Tokyo University, because of this one?

616
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:30,267
"This one"?

617
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:36,933
Are you okay, Kotoko?
Hold this for me.

618
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,933
-Are you okay?
-That's right.

619
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,567
A smart guy like Irie

620
00:44:42,733 --> 00:44:45,400
wouldn't be manipulated
by a nobody like her

621
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:48,367
and wouldn't ruin his life.

622
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,733
Nobody?

623
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:52,933
That makes sense.

624
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,367
Irie wouldn't fall in love
with such a dumb girl.

625
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:59,200
I shouldn't have believed the rumor.

626
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:01,800
"Such a dumb girl"?

627
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:05,333
Wait a second.
How dare you call me

628
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,200
"this one," "nobody" and "dumb girl."

629
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:12,200
It's very rude. Don't you think?
It is true

630
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:14,867
that Irie helped me.

631
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:19,000
-I may have caused him some troubles.
-Some?

632
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:25,000
A lot. I mean.

633
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,833
-That's right.
-That's right.

634
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,900
You don't need to say that.
What a cold-blooded guy!

635
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:33,733
You like the cold-blooded guy, don't you?

636
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,933
Hey, hey. It's getting too hot here.
The bottom line is that

637
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,133
the power of Kotoko's love
started everything.

638
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,700
Irie and Kotoko are

639
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:48,167
meant to be together forever.

640
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,600
Not a chance.

641
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,867
Then how about the good-luck charm
for the standardized test?

642
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,600
-What are you talking about?
-We can laugh at it now.

643
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:59,367
Irie fell down the stairs, because
of Kotoko's handmade good-luck charm.

644
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:02,633
Right. I remember
his walking on crutches.

645
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,333
<i>He missed a train</i>
<i>and had his leads all broken.</i>

646
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,333
Moreover, he couldn't eat lunch.
It caused a lot of troubles.

647
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,967
It's not a good-luck charm,
but a bad-luck charm.

648
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:14,333
But my point is that
it had the power of her love.

649
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,000
Just the power worked
in a opposite direction.

650
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,600
Wait.

651
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,967
Her house was destroyed

652
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:24,600
just after she gave Irie her love letter.
Am I right?

653
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:29,733
<i>Besides, Irie refused to accept it.</i>

654
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,200
No, thank you.

655
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:34,900
Wow, she is a woman
who causes a storm.

656
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:39,833
Did you get chocolate
on St. Valentine's day?

657
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,967
Yes, a pathetic one.

658
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,167
She also gave me a strange tool
to massage my head.

659
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,467
Almost comical. You don't have
good taste for a gift, huh?

660
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:50,733
These failure stories are so entertaining.

661
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,000
Who wants to share your own one?

662
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,000
Oh, no... Kotoko is breaking down.

663
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:11,567
Kotoko?

664
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,300
This is so fun.

665
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:17,167
I love to hear failure stories.

666
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,233
Fine. Now it's my turn.

667
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,333
Are you prepared?

668
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:31,100
What?

669
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:35,200
Do you think that you have
no failure stories to be exposed?

670
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:40,167
I've never done anything
embarrassing in my life.

671
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,400
Even a genius has a weak point.

672
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,367
Don't tell me...

673
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,133
What is this?
Don't tell me that this is Irie?

674
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,633
-He is like a girl.
-He wore a female dress.

675
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,767
How did you get hold of it?

676
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:30,033
Your mother gave me another copy
and I kept it in my wallet.

677
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,233
Because it's a photo of my love
in his childhood.

678
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,833
But even a 100-year romance
can turn sour,

679
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,333
if anyone sees this photo.

680
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:48,133
Now you know how we feel
when you make fun of us.

681
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:53,800
Look. Look. Oh no, it fell.

682
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,100
You come with me now.

683
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,000
It's time.

684
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:17,700
Okay, guys.

685
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,933
Let's do it.

686
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,767
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

687
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:26,167
Both Class F and Class A,

688
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,967
are you having fun?

689
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,967
I, Kin-chan,

690
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,400
will excite you more.

691
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:43,100
I wrote

692
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:45,833
this song

693
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:49,733
to dedicate to a girl whom I love.

694
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,600
Now I share my love with you,

695
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,333
which I have nurtured for three years.

696
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,933
Now I confess.

697
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:06,833
I love you, Kotoko.

698
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,633
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>

699
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,100
<i>I love, love, love you</i>

700
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:17,433
Kotoko, Kotoko, Kotoko.

701
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,867
Kotoko, Kotoko, Kotoko.

702
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:25,400
<i>Tokyo is a lonely city</i>

703
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,600
<i>Really</i>

704
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,467
<i>They don't look at each other</i>

705
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,700
<i>Seriously</i>

706
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,000
<i>But listen, Kotoko</i>

707
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:41,800
<i>Your smile</i>

708
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,600
-What do you want?
-Thank you for the mess.

709
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,400
I'm not scared of you.
You are the one

710
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:01,867
who made fun of my feelings for you
and laughed at me with others.

711
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:09,133
<i>Do you know?</i>

712
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,433
<i>I'm just glad</i>

713
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:16,633
<i>That I met</i>

714
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:19,600
<i>You</i>

715
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,433
<i>I</i>

716
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,600
<i>I</i>

717
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:28,367
<i>I</i>

718
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,900
<i>Am just happy</i>

719
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:36,233
<i>With that</i>

720
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,233
Kotoko!

721
00:51:45,967 --> 00:51:47,133
I had enough.

722
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,667
I won't

723
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,867
love you anymore.

724
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,167
Really?

725
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:08,633
You will forget about me, huh?

726
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,933
That's right. Now I know who you are.

727
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:18,000
I will forget about you and find
a handsome boy at college.

728
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,267
Go ahead. Forget about me if you can.

729
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,900
Can you forget about me now?

730
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:40,400
Kotoko.

731
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:42,400
Am I not good enough for you?

732
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:49,700
Kotoko, I'm a man of action.

733
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:05,367
<i>Kiss?</i>

734
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:08,333
<i>Is that the first kiss?</i>

735
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,567
<i>Is that the first kiss in my life?</i>

736
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:15,433
<i>Is that the kiss</i>

737
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,333
<i>I have been dreaming about?</i>

738
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,533
<i>Did I</i>

739
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:22,133
<i>have a kiss</i>

740
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,000
<i>with Irie?</i>

741
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,533
Who is that beautiful woman?

742
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,433
NEXT EPISODE

743
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,533
Is she your girlfriend?

744
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,033
-Hell no.
-Join the same club as Irie.

745
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:11,200
Then you can stay with him even though
you two belong to different departments.

746
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:12,933
Kotoko Aihara!

747
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:17,067
If you don't take action,
that woman will take Irie.

748
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:19,700
She is beautiful and has a great body.

749
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:21,400
You know nothing about him, huh?

750
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,633
Let's go back to a life with you
and me only.

751
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,500
Can't you forget about me?

752
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,600
{\an8}I don't want to see you hurt.

753
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,500
