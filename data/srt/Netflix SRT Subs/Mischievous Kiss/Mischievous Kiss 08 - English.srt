1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay, Aihara. Take this.

2
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:10,900
-Kotoko!
-Yes.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,367
<i>I can see it.</i>

4
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,100
You did it.

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,600
Did you twist your ankle?

6
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,600
-Is it here?
-It hurts!

7
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:47,933
<i>Dear Lord,</i>
<i>if I say I love Irie even more...</i>

8
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,233
<i>will you be mad at me?</i>

9
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,333
Are we at your house yet?

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,900
That's odd.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,400
There it is. That's it. My new house.

12
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,400
Yes?

13
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,733
Who are you? I live here.

14
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:15,000
-This is my house.
-No kidding.

15
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:19,633
No matter what you say,
this is my residence.

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,933
What's happening?

17
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,367
I'm sorry, Irie.

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,767
If I leave you alone with your foot
like that, my mom will get mad at me.

19
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:47,867
Until you can reach your dad, wait inside.

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,700
I wonder where my dad went.

21
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Brother, bad news.
My room is once again...

22
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:07,567
This girl. It's her fault.

23
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,867
You're home, Naoki and Kotoko.

24
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,733
I thought you were together.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
The house that I was moving into
was occupied by somebody else.

26
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,467
I contacted my dad
but couldn't get through.

27
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,833
Your dad is at the real-estate agency now.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,900
What happened?

29
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:32,500
What I heard was that there was a mistake
in the contract

30
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:38,600
and the new house was taken by
someone else a day earlier than your dad.

31
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,300
I'm terribly sorry.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,900
The group company seems
to have made another contract earlier.

33
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:51,800
You're kidding.

34
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:55,567
<i>Furniture and big items</i>
<i>were supposed to be moved from here</i>

35
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,333
<i>to the new house, right?</i>

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,367
That didn't work out either.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,100
He's been calling the mover
and the Realtor since morning

38
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,067
and has been busy all day.

39
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,500
That's why you couldn't get through.

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,700
Does that mean that my dad and I
lost our place to live again?

41
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:15,933
What can I do?

42
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,067
You can just come back to our house.

43
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,600
Mr. Aihara and you can live in our house.

44
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:33,933
We'll become a family anyway.

45
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,700
Are you still saying such stupid things?

46
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,533
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,167
You kissed, didn't you?

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,867
-I never told her. It wasn't me.
-You're kidding.

49
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,567
It's not true, is it, brother?

50
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,833
I can't believe
that you two never acted like that.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,333
You tricked your parents. You rascals.

52
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,667
How did you find out?

53
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:16,500
The one who controls information
will control the world.

54
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,233
Yes... yes.

55
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,333
That's right.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,033
That's the deal, then.

57
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:31,133
Please take good care of it.

58
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:31,267
I'm so happy that you're back.

59
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:37,667
-How do you like coming back here?
-You don't understand.

60
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,367
The relationship between Irie and me
is not what you think.

61
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,733
As soon as we find a new house,
we'll move out of here.

62
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,400
I don't know if you can find a new house.

63
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,200
What?

64
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:59,300
Anyway, I've decided again
to have you marry into our family.

65
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:05,100
Because Naoki and you have
a good enough relationship to kiss.

66
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,500
That's not true. It was just an accident.

67
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:14,700
We've never...

68
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,700
held hands.

69
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,400
Not only that...

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,133
we've never had a date.

71
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,767
Don't be so weak-spirited.

72
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,100
If you haven't done it...

73
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,700
you can just do it from now.

74
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:37,867
If you can kiss by accident,

75
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,833
you can go on a date just by some chance.

76
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,867
That's impossible.

77
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:46,467
Kotoko, go on a date with Naoki.

78
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,800
That's your mission, okay?

79
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,033
Good luck.

80
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:07,433
<i>I happen to be under orders</i>
<i>to have a first date with Irie.</i>

81
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:11,367
<i>Of course, if possible...</i>

82
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,600
<i>I want to go on a date with Irie.</i>

83
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,167
<i>But...</i>

84
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,800
<i>he has zero intention of doing it.</i>

85
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,733
<i>What can I do?</i>

86
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:29,967
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,933
{\an8}UNEXPECTED FIRST DATE

88
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,433
{\an8}You're living together again?

89
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,867
For some reason,
Mrs. Irie knew that we kissed.

90
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,167
Did you guys tell her?

91
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:51,500
Well, that was just an accident.

92
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,600
-Accident?
-Did you say "kiss"?

93
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,667
Kotoko, did you kiss Irie?

94
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,433
Kotoko, weren't you going to give up
on Irie?

95
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,933
Sorry, Kin-chan.

96
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,700
It was too much stress for Kin-chan.

97
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,600
But maybe it's better this way.

98
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,433
Satomi?

99
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,833
Because you're not giving up
on Irie at all.

100
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,600
<i>You already know, don't you?</i>

101
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,067
<i>Even if there's a rival or any obstacles,</i>

102
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,700
<i>your feelings towards Irie won't change.</i>

103
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,467
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>Kin-chan should give up on you</i>

104
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,133
<i>and move forward.</i>

105
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,000
But I haven't
gotten Irie's attention either.

106
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,633
<i>Speak of the devil...</i>

107
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,767
Irie, why don't we go to a movie
this Sunday?

108
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,100
I have two tickets.

109
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:32,833
<i>What? Yuko Matsumoto is also aiming</i>
<i>to have a first date with Irie?</i>

110
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,233
<i>Oh, no. I don't feel like I can win.</i>

111
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:51,267
-What are you doing, Mr. Sudo?
-Why are you here, Aihara?

112
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,200
You were watching Irie, weren't you?

113
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:59,900
Are you watching Ms. Matsumoto,
as well?

114
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:07,833
Maybe Ms. Matsumoto is who you admire.

115
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,200
-Aihara.
-No!

116
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,000
What are you doing in broad daylight?

117
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,767
This is not what you think.
This is... well...

118
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:24,233
-The rumor I heard was true.
-The rumor?

119
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,633
The rumor that you and Mr. Sudo
have something going on.

120
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,633
Don't make up stories.

121
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,367
Because you told people
that you'd give up on Irie.

122
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:38,033
That's because of Mr. Sudo, right?

123
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,667
-It's a big rumor in the club.
-What?

124
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,533
-Is that right?
-No, that's not true.

125
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,167
Irie, there's a misunderstanding.

126
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,400
-It's not that.
-It's none of my business.

127
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,167
Oh, Matsumoto.
In answer to your invitation...

128
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:01,133
I'm free on Sunday,
so, I can go to a movie.

129
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,267
Really? Thank you.

130
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,300
It's your fault.
You put your weight on me all of a sudden.

131
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,467
I forgot that you injured your ankle.
I'm very sorry.

132
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,800
I didn't know that our relationship

133
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,267
was a big piece of gossip
in the Tennis Club.

134
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,267
There's no way that's happening.

135
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,833
It's just Ms. Matsumoto's made-up story.

136
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,267
So that she can give Irie
a good impression of her.

137
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:50,433
Matsumoto is not the kind of girl
who tells a stupid lie like that.

138
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,633
You really like Matsumoto, don't you?

139
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,967
Aihara, I want to discuss something
with you.

140
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,167
Well, say...

141
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,600
you like Irie and I like Matsumoto.

142
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:18,033
Matsumoto likes Irie. Isn't that bad?

143
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,633
Nobody can be happy, right?

144
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,467
So, I suggest that we come up
with an agreement

145
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:26,033
and cooperate with each other.
How about that?

146
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,133
-Cooperate. How?
-For example...

147
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:34,600
What?

148
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,700
-Really?
-Tail Irie during his date?

149
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,800
What will you do if Kin-chan hears us?

150
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,833
Good. Kin-chan seems to be off today.

151
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,067
What's wrong, Kotoko?

152
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,267
Tissue, tissue. Good.

153
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,033
-Okay. It's done.
-What would you do tailing him?

154
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,767
I don't know, but...

155
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:05,467
I don't know what to do
if anything happens with those two.

156
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,367
Thinking of that makes me worry so much.

157
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
-You're so pitiful.
-I can't help it.

158
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:19,600
You just got robbed of your first date
by Yuko Matsumoto.

159
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,167
On top of all that,
you're going to tail him?

160
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,233
That's just like Mr. Sudo and you
are going out on a date.

161
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,567
Don't you hear a weird noise?

162
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,400
Jinko, we're talking
about important stuff.

163
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:33,800
Zip your mouth.

164
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,933
-Do you want this apple tea?
-Orange juice.

165
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,633
Mr. Sudo and Kotoko are going on a date?
What's happening?

166
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,467
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>that's what you're going to do?</i>

167
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,233
<i>I can't do anything about it.</i>
<i>That's what love is.</i>

168
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,567
Did Kotoko fall for a new guy?

169
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,033
That mustache dude?

170
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:14,500
<i>-The date is... a movie.</i>
<i>-Ginza.</i>

171
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,767
<i>-Oh, Karasumori?</i>
<i>-Shinbashi.</i>

172
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,167
Ginza, Karasumori.

173
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,300
-Shinbashi.
-I don't care about the place.

174
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,167
<i>The movie date... Roman...</i>

175
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,467
Date, movie.

176
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,267
Ginza, Karasumori.

177
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,333
Shinbashi.

178
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,233
Roman?

179
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,333
"Date, movie, Ginza.

180
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,333
Karasumori, Shinbashi, Roman."

181
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:24,833
I don't get it at all! I'm going crazy.

182
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,067
-Kinnosuke, what are you doing?
-I'm sorry, bro.

183
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:29,967
What's that?

184
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,700
-I don't get it.
-Is this some kind of code?

185
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,533
"Date, movie, Ginza, Karasumori.

186
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,133
-Shinbashi, Roman."
-It drives you crazy, doesn't it?

187
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,933
I see.

188
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,600
-Did you figure it out?
-Are you going on a date?

189
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,167
-No.
-That's what I thought.

190
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,600
There's no way you could go out
on such a sexy grown-up date.

191
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:03,400
What? What? What?

192
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,500
Sexy?

193
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Sorry, Kotoko.

194
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,100
I went to many different Realtors,

195
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,567
but even when I found a good one,
somebody else won the contract by a hair.

196
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:23,833
-I see.
-I'm so unlucky.

197
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:28,933
Anyway, we won't be able
to find a new house anytime soon.

198
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:33,333
So, we'll have to live
with the Irie family for a while.

199
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,767
It's not something
that you have to apologize to me for.

200
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,333
But...

201
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,033
we made a big decision
to move out of the Iries' home.

202
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:49,533
I'm wondering
if you were having a hard time.

203
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,967
<i>In answer to your invitation,</i>

204
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm free on Sunday,
so, I can go to a movie.

205
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,833
Really? Thank you.

206
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:12,400
-I thought so.
-No, Dad.

207
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:15,133
Listen.

208
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,433
I still like Irie.

209
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,533
-But Naoki's feelings are...
-That has nothing to do with it.

210
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:39,400
It might be impossible for Irie
to fall for me, but...

211
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,633
I don't want to give up until the end.

212
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:50,600
You always tell me that it's not good
to quit in the middle of something.

213
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,733
I realized after I left the Iries' home...

214
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:02,700
something that I don't want to give up
is this feeling.

215
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,200
So, don't worry about me anymore, Dad.

216
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:13,867
Even if I get my heart broken,

217
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,300
it's better than doing nothing
and regretting it.

218
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:23,367
-You're so similar.
-To my mom?

219
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,967
No, to me.

220
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:32,133
You are definitely my daughter.

221
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:45,333
SUNDAY

222
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,167
This isn't it.

223
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,533
The flower print isn't it either.

224
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,133
White looks cute, too.

225
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:12,900
I pick...

226
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,667
this one.

227
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,233
<i>Even if I put makeup on...</i>

228
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,667
<i>the person who's going on a date</i>
<i>with Irie is not me...</i>

229
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>but Matsumoto.</i>

230
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:12,933
<i>I wanted to go on a date with Irie too.</i>

231
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,567
<i>Get dressed up and put makeup on.</i>

232
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,433
<i>We'd watch a movie and go shopping.</i>

233
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:27,533
<i>Eat dinner at a fancy little restaurant.</i>

234
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,267
All right.

235
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,567
That's her.

236
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,600
-Nice body.
-Mr. Sudo, when did you get here?

237
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,833
-Is Irie a quick worker?
-What?

238
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Well, not so much.

239
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,700
He's rather slow.

240
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,100
That's because of you.

241
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:35,267
Matsumoto's sexiness will tempt Irie.

242
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,467
Oh, Irie.

243
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,833
Irie.

244
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,300
-Did I make you wait?
-No, I came early.

245
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:54,033
-You look good in that dress.
-Really?

246
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,300
-I'm glad.
-That guy is being so affected.

247
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,400
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

248
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:25,300
Sexy... sexy...

249
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,667
Hey, Kinnosuke, this way.

250
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,867
Kotoko!

251
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,133
I'd like to have seats right behind them.

252
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,567
Hurry, hurry.

253
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,600
Ta-da! See? Isn't it perfect?

254
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,600
Movie, Shinbashi, Roman.

255
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,200
A minute's walk from the Karasumori exit.

256
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,167
How about Ginza?

257
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,467
You don't know that?

258
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,367
When they feel naughty after the movie...

259
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:17,400
they retire to a fancy little hotel
in Ginza.

260
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,867
That mustache guy, what is he thinking?

261
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,833
Showing something like this to Kotoko
and... doing something naughty?

262
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:50,800
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

263
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,800
What are you doing? This way.

264
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,867
What's this?

265
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,933
Oh, my. I... dropped a pamphlet.

266
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,867
Grandma, pull yourself together.

267
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,133
You're right. Grandpa.

268
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
-Me, too.
-What are you doing?

269
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,033
You got ketchup on your face.

270
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,967
Oh, my back.

271
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:58,000
Hey, Kinnosuke, let's wait inside.

272
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:01,733
I gave up on a kiss...

273
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,800
but I'm never going to give up

274
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,367
against other guys!

275
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,600
Hey, what's wrong with you?

276
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,433
Sit down. I can't see anything.

277
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:53,667
-It was a good movie.
-Do you want to have some tea?

278
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:58,900
Let's!

279
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:13,267
I've been interested in you
since I was in junior high.

280
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,933
I heard that there was
a prodigy tennis player in Tonan.

281
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:22,300
On top of that, you're handsome
and have good grades.

282
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,433
Your dad is CEO of a company
and a Tokyo University alumnus, right?

283
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,467
I thought you'd apply for another college.

284
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,433
But when I heard that you were going
to Tonan...

285
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:34,800
I was happy.

286
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,633
I felt it was destiny.

287
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,733
Is that right?

288
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:47,767
Tell me, what type of girls do you like?

289
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,633
My type?

290
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,067
Let's see.

291
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:58,433
Beautiful and... glamorous.

292
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,133
I want a smart girl.

293
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,833
And... being a good cook is a must.

294
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,600
Aihara.

295
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,933
There's something good about you.

296
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:25,300
It's okay. You don't have to cheer me up.

297
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,967
I see. What do you think?

298
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:35,067
Don't we make a good couple?

299
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,467
Probably.

300
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,133
We still have time before dinner.

301
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,767
-Will you go shopping with me?
-Sure.

302
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
Which one do you like?

303
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,100
This one. You'll wear it well.

304
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,567
Do you think so?

305
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,900
Excuse me, may I try this on?

306
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,600
Yes. Thank you. This way, please.

307
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:27,200
How come Irie is looking
at women's accessories?

308
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,767
Is he going to give it to Matsumoto?

309
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:32,333
No way.

310
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,300
I've never gotten anything from him
even though I've been living with him.

311
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,800
Irie, can you zip up the back?

312
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,700
Thank you. How do I look?

313
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:00,833
Mr. Sudo.

314
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:04,600
Hold on.

315
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,833
-What is he going to do?
-I'm scared.

316
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,967
No, don't. Don't touch her.

317
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:18,300
No!

318
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:20,867
How about this?

319
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,367
Nice, Irie.

320
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:26,667
You have good taste.
It goes with this dress.

321
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,933
Because the model is good.

322
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm happy to hear that
even if it's flattery.

323
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,500
I feel dizzy with that different world.

324
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,567
Don't you think
that they were made for each other?

325
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,333
What are you doing, approving of them?

326
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,833
-I'll hold it.
-Thank you.

327
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:03,333
Okay, let's go.

328
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,900
I want shoes, too.

329
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,067
-I have a pair that I wanted.
-Watch out.

330
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,300
Are you okay?

331
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,967
-Thank you.
-It's good that you didn't get hurt.

332
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:35,367
Mr. Sudo, I'm going home now.

333
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:40,333
-What are you talking about?
-I can't bear to watch them anymore.

334
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,667
We're here to prevent the situation
that's unbearable to watch.

335
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:47,967
But there's nothing we can do
if they like each other.

336
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,033
It's too miserable.

337
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,467
-I'm sorry, Mr. Sudo. I'm leaving.
-Okay.

338
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,000
Get home safely.

339
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:00,433
I'm sorry.

340
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,800
What are you going to do with this?

341
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,800
-I'll pay for the cleaning.
-That's not enough!

342
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,933
This shirt is expensive. It's 100,000 yen!

343
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,100
100,000 yen?

344
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:14,933
-What can I do?
-I'll take care of it.

345
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,567
-Here's 1020...
-Hey, lady.

346
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,033
You have a pretty face.

347
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,533
Why don't you come over to my office

348
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,333
and discuss this and that? Let's go.

349
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,067
Please, stop it.

350
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:31,400
<i>I'm being punished</i>
<i>because I was interrupting someone's date.</i>

351
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,133
-Let's go now.
-1500 yen should be enough.

352
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,267
Why are you here?

353
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:42,467
Hey, little fella, what did you just say?

354
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,233
The cleaning fee
for the cheap shirt should be covered

355
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,467
by 1500 yen.

356
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:50,233
Don't be so arrogant.

357
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,867
He's so cool, isn't he?

358
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:08,367
Excuse me. Mr. Sudo.

359
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:14,200
You got it now.
You've been tailing us for the whole day.

360
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:18,900
Show her your strength
and get Matsumoto to fall for you.

361
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
-Irie.
-Sorry, I've got to go now.

362
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:36,033
-Wait!
-That's what I want to say!

363
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,233
Take this!

364
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,167
<i>I'm...</i>

365
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,367
<i>running away with Irie.</i>

366
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,100
<i>It's like a dream.</i>

367
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,100
<i>I wish...</i>

368
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,067
<i>time would stop right now.</i>

369
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,633
We'll be okay now.

370
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:33,533
Irie, did you notice that...

371
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,233
we were tailing you?

372
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,633
I noticed your crappy tailing
when I got to the meeting place.

373
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,367
Then you knew
that Mr. Sudo liked Matsumoto?

374
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:52,600
I thought you and Sudo were a couple
until yesterday.

375
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,533
But I knew when you two followed us.

376
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,300
It was so funny to see your reaction.

377
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,633
I'm sorry.

378
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:13,267
When I heard you were going on a date
with Ms. Matsumoto...

379
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,000
I couldn't contain myself.

380
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,733
But if you like Ms. Matsumoto...

381
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,267
-I got in your way so bad.
-Shall we go somewhere?

382
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:39,767
Okay.

383
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,933
Then I'll go home.

384
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:48,033
I'll go!

385
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,100
-Yes, yes, yes. I'm coming.
-Just say it once.

386
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,100
I'm sorry.

387
00:37:58,767 --> 00:37:59,867
Where shall we go?

388
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,300
Then a movie theater.

389
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,100
We've been there, so...

390
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:10,933
let's go shopping and after that
we'll go to a nice restaurant.

391
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,233
-We'll eat dinner, then...
-In that outfit?

392
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You're right.

393
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,300
You'll be embarrassed with me like this.

394
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,000
Come on.

395
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:07,933
It's so beautiful. Look, Irie.
Isn't it beautiful?

396
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:21,600
Irie?

397
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:26,667
Irie? Where are you?

398
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,300
Irie.

399
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:37,200
Irie.

400
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,633
<i>Is he making fun of me again?</i>

401
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,433
We can't go to the restaurant like that.
Here's dinner.

402
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:47,033
It's delicious.

403
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,567
Anything tastes good when you're hungry.

404
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,533
<i>No tasty French, Italian or Chinese...</i>

405
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:06,067
<i>could win against this hamburger.</i>

406
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:36,367
I'd never experienced anything hard
until a while ago.

407
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,200
But since my last year of high school...

408
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,033
after I got a love letter from you...

409
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,667
almost every day has been a series
of hardships and frustrations.

410
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:57,467
I think you're the trial that I was given.

411
00:41:59,133 --> 00:41:59,967
Trial?

412
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:05,433
I... got confused by the first trial
that I was given.

413
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,167
I was trying to get away from it.

414
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,133
You're telling me that I'm a pest
or something.

415
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,667
But...

416
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,100
compared to a life without any hardship,

417
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:22,900
it's more interesting
to face these trials.

418
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:27,567
Thank you.

419
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,833
If you don't understand, it's okay.

420
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,033
I can understand that.
Don't make a fool of me.

421
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,033
You mean you wanted to get away from me,
but you changed your mind.

422
00:42:56,467 --> 00:42:59,133
Do you want to marry me?

423
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,300
-Is this a proposal?
-Idiot. How can you think that?

424
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,767
I'm saying that...

425
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:14,633
I don't mind being in the same house
as you.

426
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,233
That means...

427
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,033
you don't...

428
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:31,900
hate me?

429
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:37,967
You're hard to deal with,
but I don't hate you.

430
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:05,233
Now not just your clothes
but your face will be a disaster.

431
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,200
I can't help it.

432
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:29,100
It was a good one.

433
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,967
Three movies in a row is something else.

434
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:37,167
Oh, Kinnosuke, are you still here?

435
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:42,700
Kotoko, where are you?

436
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:45,667
Kinnosuke?

437
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,233
Kinnosuke?

438
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:54,100
It's bad.

439
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:15,133
<i>After an unexpected turn of events,</i>
<i>I won my first date with Irie.</i>

440
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,333
<i>It was completely different</i>
<i>from what I had dreamed of, but...</i>

441
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:25,900
<i>more than our first kiss...</i>

442
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:29,267
<i>or the first time he held me...</i>

443
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:33,833
<i>I felt Irie...</i>

444
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:36,700
<i>was even closer to me.</i>

445
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,033
No, I'm against that.

446
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,400
Just when Kotoko finally came back,
you're moving out?

447
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:14,600
Well, boys need that kind of experience.

448
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,233
If Naoki wants to do it...

449
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:21,367
it may not be a bad idea
for him to live by himself.

450
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,867
Why don't you try it?

451
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,167
Thank you.

452
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,433
<i>Irie is moving out of here</i>
<i>and living by himself?</i>

453
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:47,167
<i>He just told me</i>
<i>that he didn't mind living with me.</i>

454
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,533
<i>Why?</i>

455
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,067
<i>What does this mean?</i>

456
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,133
I wonder if he doesn't like me.

457
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,600
Since he moved out as
soon as we're back.

458
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,967
I found out. Why don't we go spy
on him where he works?

459
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:44,500
I'll work here. That way I can be
close to Irie.

460
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,167
-Thank you for waiting.
-Yeah.

461
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:50,567
Ms. Matsumoto, how do you know
that Irie works here?

462
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,767
-He told me.
-I'll stay with you right here.

463
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,133
{\an8}The distance between Irie and me
will get farther and farther.

464
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,467
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
