1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,933
Is it true that you will meet a
prospective marriage partner?

2
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:09,667
She is a granddaughter of the chairman
of a big corporation.

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,500
Ruin his formal meeting?

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:14,933
She wants

5
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,767
to proceed with this arrangement.

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:22,067
I thought that I was
getting closer to Irie.

7
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,467
So I still can't believe it.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,167
Kotoko is my dearest.

9
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,700
You played with her feelings.

10
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,733
I can't forgive you.

11
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,400
Then what are you going to do?

12
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,333
I will steal Kotoko from you.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,433
No. I mean I will protect her from you.

14
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,167
Do whatever you want.

15
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,433
Next Sunday,

16
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,767
-do you want to go out with me?
-Okay. Let's do that.

17
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,100
<i>Irie and I are about</i>

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,667
<i>to go our separate ways.</i>

19
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,333
<i>I must wonder what kind of future</i>

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,567
<i>is awaiting us at the end of the road.</i>

21
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,667
Good morning.

22
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,433
Good morning.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,933
Kotoko has a date today.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,133
Date?

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,300
She went out, dressed up nicely.

26
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,733
<i>Do not bother us.</i>

27
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,267
You have someone whom you want to
marry. Then you know how I feel.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,767
Just like you care about that woman,

29
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,067
I care about Kotoko.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,067
I've never seen Kotoko

31
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,633
so heartbroken.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,967
Really? Who dares go out
with such a woman?

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,433
Naoki, are you sure about this?

34
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,400
Son.

35
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,233
Sorry.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,600
I have some documents to read
by Monday.

37
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,533
What is he thinking?

38
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,867
I love it.

39
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,567
I really like the car chase scene.

40
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,467
It was so cool.

41
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,567
Today is a day to release our stress.

42
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,167
Let's go to a video arcade.

43
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,600
I'd love to.

44
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,600
Let's have fun.

45
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,200
Let's go crazy.

46
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,300
Let's do it, Kotoko.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,767
-I'm ready to serve the country.
-I'm ready to serve the country.

48
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:36,233
Something is coming.

49
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,333
Go, Kin-chan.

50
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,100
Good. I got it.

51
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,033
One more time.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,667
<i>I didn't expect to have so much fun</i>

53
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,967
<i>with Kin-chan.</i>

54
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,267
<i>It allowed me to forget about Irie,</i>

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,533
<i>even though it was only for a while.</i>

56
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,633
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

57
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,100
You had a date with Kin-chan?

58
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,267
{\an8}GOODBYE, IRIE

59
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:31,567
{\an8}Kin-chan and I have been good friends
since we were in the high school.

60
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:37,167
But this is the first time
we went out together.

61
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,100
And?

62
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,000
And how was the date?

63
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,700
Kin-chan is not good enough, huh?

64
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:48,133
That's not what I mean.

65
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,467
I enjoyed it

66
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,033
more than I expected.

67
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,367
I was having so much fun
that I felt that time flied.

68
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,633
And?

69
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,267
I had so much fun today. Thank you.

70
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,433
Me, too. I don't know when was the last
time I had so much fun.

71
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,200
See you.

72
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,700
Kotoko.

73
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,633
Can you go out with me again?

74
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,567
I will find some other places
you would enjoy.

75
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,967
You don't need to take it seriously.
Just think of it as a casual date.

76
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,700
When you want to have fun, call me.

77
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,933
Sure.

78
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,033
Let's go out again, Kin-chan.

79
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,667
-Kotoko?
-Kotoko?

80
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,600
To tell you the truth,

81
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,667
I've agreed to go out with him again.

82
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,367
That's a quick development.

83
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,200
Finally you've become
a normal college student.

84
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,100
It's not like that.

85
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,067
A date? A party? Whatever.

86
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,867
Have a seat, Kotoko.

87
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,133
Listen, Kotoko.

88
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,067
If you can forget about the heartless
Irie even for a moment

89
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,400
and enjoy your life.

90
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,767
Satomi.

91
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,033
You don't need a boyfriend.

92
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,367
Do not make a snap judgment
about a boyfriend.

93
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,200
Just have fun

94
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,567
with Kin-chan or any other boys.

95
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,600
That's right. Find something to cheer
you up. That's what you need right now.

96
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:48,233
"Kin-chan or any other boys"'?
I feel bad for Kin-chan.

97
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,567
Listen.

98
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,000
If you really feel that way,

99
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,600
even a little bit,

100
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,700
it means that

101
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,367
you like Kin-chan.

102
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:05,133
Is that right?
You care about him.

103
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,900
We call it "love."

104
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,867
What do you think? You love Kin-chan?

105
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:21,133
Well... I'm not sure about that, but...

106
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,800
Kin-chan is

107
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:33,467
a good guy.

108
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,067
Come on.

109
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:40,067
Finally you realized that?

110
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,800
What a brilliant performance!

111
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,167
Yes.

112
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,000
I love Stravinsky.

113
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,233
It tells me something about you, Naoki.

114
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:05,467
He changes his compositional style
in every work.

115
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,367
That's why they call him "Chameleon."

116
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I think you also have
such a mysterious side in you.

117
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,567
I am attracted to you by that.

118
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,967
You overestimate me.

119
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,700
But I was really upset.

120
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:24,233
Did you see the person
sitting in front of us?

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,067
As soon as the performance started,
the person fell asleep.

122
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:31,633
It was obvious that the person was dozing.

123
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,800
I can't believe it.
It was one of the best seats.

124
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,600
Why are you smiling, Naoki?

125
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,667
Nothing.

126
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,700
Let's go.

127
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:03,933
This restaurant
only plays opera music.

128
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Do you like opera music?

129
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,233
Of course I do.

130
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,200
I like Tristan.

131
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,767
Tristan, huh? That's a good one.

132
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm home.

133
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,933
You are so late.

134
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,767
I told you that I would be late,
because of a date with Sahoko.

135
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:36,967
I know that. But how long
did the concert last?

136
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:41,967
We had a dinner together after that.
I told you about that, too.

137
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:45,033
I hope that Sahoko and you

138
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
didn't do any indecent things.

139
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,300
Indecent things?
What are you talking about?

140
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm not a teenager.

141
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,267
We are dating with marriage in mind.

142
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:00,133
You can imagine whatever you want,
but keep it in mind.

143
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,367
But I have not approved
of your marrying her.

144
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,633
Remember what my father said.

145
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,433
"It's your choice whom you want to marry."

146
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,033
When he said that, you agreed with him.

147
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,833
I did, but...

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,800
I had Kotoko in my mind
when we talked about that.

149
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,433
Anyway,

150
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,633
regarding my marriage,

151
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
I will make a decision by myself,
no matter what your opinion is.

152
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,100
Oh, my goodness.

153
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,267
I'm home.

154
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,967
Kotoko, you are late, too.

155
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,933
Did you have a date, too?

156
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,933
"Too"? It means Irie had a date?

157
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,733
We went to a concert.

158
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,733
I see.

159
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,700
What? I didn't have a date.

160
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:55,267
I forgot to tell you, but I started
helping at my father's restaurant.

161
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,133
Helping at his restaurant?

162
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,800
You want to be a chef like him?

163
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,133
No. No way I can become a chef.

164
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm glad to hear that.

165
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:09,200
I don't want to see customers
having a stomach ache.

166
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,167
I know I can't cook,

167
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,400
but I could be some help
in serving the food.

168
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,633
So I'm learning.

169
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,700
Kin-chan is also working there
and is helping me.

170
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,967
It sounds like a date.

171
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,867
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mix
business with relationship.

172
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,033
How about him?

173
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,067
What are you talking about?

174
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,700
Apologize to Kin-chan.

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,600
See. I was right.

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,267
Even if that's so,

177
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,100
it's none of your business.

178
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,567
That's true.

179
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,367
I have no interest at all
in your relationship.

180
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,233
Calm down, the both of you.

181
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,433
Wait.

182
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,533
This sounds like

183
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,000
a lovers' quarrel.

184
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,200
No, it's not.

185
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,000
No?

186
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,667
I don't need dinner tomorrow night,
either.

187
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,233
Going out again?

188
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,267
None of your business. Good night.

189
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,400
Kotoko...

190
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,433
I have to prepare for tomorrow's classes.
So please excuse me.

191
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:26,767
And I have dinner at the restaurant
every night from now on.

192
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,000
Good night.

193
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:37,133
<i>It's over, honey.</i>

194
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:42,233
Naoki holds on his course
to marry Sahoko.

195
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,067
Kotoko is dating

196
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:48,633
with a chef apprentice Kin-chan.

197
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,400
And, since she is helping
at her father's restaurant,

198
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,867
the boy and Kotoko will get closer.

199
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:01,533
Well...

200
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,600
I got a call from Kanamori yesterday.

201
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:08,500
According to him,
Chairman Oizumi wants to have

202
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,867
a formal engagement ceremony
as soon as I leave the hospital.

203
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,900
You are doing great.
You may be able to go home soon.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,933
-Really?
-Yes.

205
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,367
You have been doing great.

206
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,167
Thank you for performing

207
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,133
such a successful surgery on me.

208
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:54,467
But you have a dream to be a doctor.

209
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,833
It is not a long-time dream.

210
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,300
Are you giving up your dream?

211
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,267
You want to talk to me?

212
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,467
Yes.

213
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:29,767
You know that I'll be discharged
from the hospital this weekend. Right?

214
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,433
Yeah.

215
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,933
My heart is not in a good shape, is it?

216
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,433
I have to have a surgery soon.
Am I right?

217
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,267
I know that, even though you guys
are keeping it from me.

218
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,067
I can tell it from your mother's attitude.

219
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,133
I will return to the company
before having surgery.

220
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,500
I want to settle

221
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:02,900
all the issues my company is facing
before having surgery.

222
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,067
But stress

223
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,900
will worsen your heart condition
if you return to the company.

224
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,167
But I cannot allow you

225
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,767
to marry someone
whom you don't even love.

226
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,433
"I don't even love"?

227
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,000
You have no idea how I feel.

228
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,333
Listen, Naoki.

229
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,233
You are my son.

230
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,167
Your happiness is more important

231
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:41,833
than my business. That's why--

232
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:46,000
That's enough. This is my life.
I will make my own decision.

233
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,933
So, Father...

234
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:54,133
Take care of yourself.
That's all you need to do.

235
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,267
Focus on your health.

236
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,333
MEDICAL IMMUNOLOGY

237
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,867
Kotoko, this goes to Table Number 3.

238
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,767
Sure.

239
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,633
I take this, so you serve the dish.

240
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,933
Thank you, Kin-chan.

241
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:35,767
They look like a good couple.

242
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,500
Hey, everyone. Daddy is home.

243
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,767
I'm home.

244
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,033
Yeah!

245
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,267
Hey, Yuki.

246
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,967
-Nice to see you at home.
-Thank you.

247
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,600
Are you ready?

248
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,567
-Mr. Irie!
-Iri-chan.

249
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,433
Honey!

250
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:11,100
Just kidding.

251
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,467
As you can see, I feel great.

252
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,267
I've made a full comeback.

253
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,067
You scared the hell out of us.

254
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,267
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:21,467
Mrs. Irie, it tells you that he is fully
recovered.

256
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,267
Let's celebrate it today.

257
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,567
Thank you.

258
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:28,067
Let's go.

259
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,967
Here you go. Enjoy.

260
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:36,067
-Wow.
-Looks great.

261
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,267
I made all your favorite dishes.

262
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:39,967
I'm so happy.

263
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,833
I was tired of hospital meals.

264
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,100
You are not fully recovered yet.

265
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:48,667
So do not smoke. No alcohol.
No sweets. No greasy food.

266
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,167
Don't say that.

267
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:54,967
I went through weeks of tasteless meals
in the hospital.

268
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,200
That's not the point.

269
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,267
Well, your son is right, honey.

270
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,200
No excessive eating.

271
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:02,500
Okay.

272
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,800
Now let's start the celebration.

273
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,600
Get your glass.

274
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,333
Can we have your words first, honey?

275
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:16,700
My sudden hospitalization
caused you so much trouble.

276
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm really sorry.

277
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:24,633
Thanks to your support,
I got better enough to come home.

278
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,667
I'm so grateful.

279
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,700
Cheers!

280
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,333
Cheers!

281
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,467
Everyone, eat.

282
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,533
I will enjoy Ai-chan's signature dishes.

283
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,033
-Bon appetite.
-Bon appetite.

284
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,467
I want meat.

285
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,367
Then I take fish.

286
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh, no, I can't grab it.

287
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,700
Home sweet home.

288
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,433
It's nice to have a meal

289
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,967
with all the family together.

290
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:12,967
Family is the best.

291
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,067
What? Visitor?

292
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,433
This is strange.

293
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,333
I didn't invite anyone to this party.

294
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,967
It's my guest.

295
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:44,767
Who did Naoki invite?

296
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,733
I have a bad feeling about this.

297
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,633
Chairman Oizumi.

298
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,867
Hi, Mr. Irie. I'm glad to see that you
came back home.

299
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,067
Since Naoki invited us, we are here
to celebrate your recovery.

300
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,367
Thank you for coming all the way.

301
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:11,433
-I really appreciate your kindness.
-You look great.

302
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,467
Naoki.

303
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:16,567
I told you that this would be a party
only for family members.

304
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,133
That's why I invited them.

305
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:25,000
Father, this is Sahoko Oizumi.

306
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,433
Very nice to meet you.

307
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,833
Please sit here.

308
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,567
Kotoko, move.

309
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:32,967
Please have a seat.

310
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:35,067
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.

311
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,600
-You sit here.
-Thank you.

312
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,500
Honey, take this.

313
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,267
This is my wife.

314
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,433
You may have met her before.

315
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,033
That's Yuki, Naoki's younger brother.

316
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,100
How do you do?

317
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,367
How do you do?

318
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,333
Mr. Irie.

319
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,433
We want to celebrate
your recovery together.

320
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,467
This is for you. I hope you like it.

321
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,700
What is this?

322
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:17,300
Wow.

323
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,467
Here you go.

324
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,800
This is so delicious. Sahoko,
did you make all of them by yourself?

325
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,367
Hope you like it.

326
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,667
I like it? I love it.

327
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,733
Seasoning is perfect

328
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:35,500
and accentuates the flavor
of each ingredient.

329
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:38,633
This is one of a kind.

330
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,500
Come on, honey.
Your praise is over the top.

331
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:45,733
Don't make Mr. Aihara feel bad.
He is a professional chef.

332
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:50,800
Wow.

333
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,933
You cooked it without sugar
and animal fat, didn't you?

334
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,367
That's right.

335
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,467
I hear that Mr. Irie had a heart problem.

336
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,067
What a thoughtful lady you are!
This is so delicious.

337
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,533
This is brilliant cooking.

338
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,600
Chairman, this is my friend Aihara.

339
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:15,800
He owns a very popular Japanese
restaurant.

340
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:18,133
I see.

341
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,033
A professional chef is eating
my dishes? I'm embarrassed.

342
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:26,667
You shouldn't be. You could offer
these dishes in a restaurant.

343
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:31,767
You substitute sweet drink for sugar, huh?

344
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,400
You are absolutely right.

345
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,533
Where did you learn such a classic
cooking method?

346
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,800
My mother taught me. That's all.

347
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:44,400
Then your mother must be
up with the professional chefs.

348
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,000
I should learn it from you.

349
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,300
This is unbelievable.

350
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,933
It's so delicious.

351
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,633
Right?

352
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:58,200
So you must be Mr. Irie's best friend.

353
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,300
I should have introduced myself first.
I'm Aihara.

354
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:04,300
Mr. and Mrs. Aihara are nice to invite
me to this family party.

355
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,467
I'm sure you are like
a family member to them.

356
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,833
And is this your daughter,

357
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,467
who lives with the Irie family?

358
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,300
Nice to meet you. I'm Kotoko Aihara.

359
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,800
It's nothing.

360
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:28,500
I hear that Mrs. Irie adores her.

361
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,167
That's why I have been curious.

362
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,900
Grandpa, you are staring at Kotoko.
It's rude.

363
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,167
You are right.

364
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,567
You are so cute

365
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,633
that I couldn't take my eyes off.

366
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,100
Thank you for your compliment.

367
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,767
Kotoko, can we talk privately?

368
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,267
I've wanted to have a talk with you.

369
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,367
Sorry about my grandpa.

370
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,400
His attitude was rude.

371
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't worry about it.

372
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:14,567
To be honest with you,
both my grandpa and I

373
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,633
are jealous of you.

374
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
Why?

375
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,067
That's because you have lived

376
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:25,367
with Naoki for more than two years.

377
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:31,567
-Yes.
-Besides, Naoki's mother loves you.

378
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:36,933
That's why I envy you.

379
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,200
Well...

380
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,033
Sahoko.

381
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,933
Why do you like Irie?

382
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,567
On that day, my grandpa

383
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:07,100
wanted to talk to me
about something important.

384
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:12,700
It turned out that it was about meeting
Naoki as a potential marriage partner.

385
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,333
Are you okay?

386
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,400
<i>He was such a gentleman.</i>

387
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,100
<i>And he was kind.</i>

388
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:31,400
<i>I fell in love with him</i>
<i>at first sight.</i>

389
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:36,900
I didn't even dream that I would meet him
as a potential marriage partner.

390
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,933
So I was stunned

391
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,333
<i>when I saw him in the formal meeting.</i>

392
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,800
I thought that it was my destiny.

393
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:56,567
<i>I also fell in love with Irie</i>
<i>at first sight.</i>

394
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,033
TONAN HIGH SCHOOL
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

395
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,267
<i>I had a crush on him</i>
<i>for two years since then.</i>

396
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:05,733
<i>After a strange turn of events,</i>
<i>we ended up living together.</i>

397
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,867
<i>But I never thought that</i>

398
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,533
<i>it was my destiny.</i>

399
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:17,267
<i>Nothing happened between</i>
<i>the two of us as time passed.</i>

400
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,400
I wish I could have had

401
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,333
such a romantic encounter.

402
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,300
You wish you could have had?

403
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,700
I mean I wish I can have
such a romantic encounter.

404
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,267
To tell you the truth,

405
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:40,967
I was going to turn down the meeting.

406
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:44,567
I'm still in college and I thought
I was too young to marry.

407
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:50,867
But my grandpa convinced me
to meet him anyway.

408
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,733
Then it happened.

409
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,533
I never imagined this to happen.

410
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:03,233
You never know what happens next.

411
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,133
I agree.

412
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
But

413
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm

414
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,500
scared.

415
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,200
Why?

416
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,933
It seems to me that Naoki
is trying to be nice to me

417
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:25,533
and I feel distant from the real side
of him as he does.

418
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:29,567
Sometimes I don't understand
what he is really thinking.

419
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:36,267
I'm losing my confidence.

420
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,900
It's very strange, isn't it?

421
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,267
It's because

422
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,033
you really love Irie.

423
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,967
It's not strange at all.

424
00:30:57,133 --> 00:31:01,467
If you fall in love with someone,
that's how you feel, isn't it?

425
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,333
<i>Even though you are determined</i>
<i>to pursue your love,</i>

426
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
<i>a trivial thing</i>
<i>could destroy your confidence.</i>

427
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,633
Sahoko, you are beautiful and elegant.

428
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,967
If a perfect woman like you
loses her confidence,

429
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:23,033
it could happen to anyone.

430
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,700
Even if you are depressed,

431
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,067
<i>you can be so happy</i>

432
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:36,300
<i>and feel walking on air</i>
<i>when he is nice to you just once.</i>

433
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:40,467
<i>And you believe in your chance</i>

434
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,967
<i>and become the happiest person</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

435
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:49,800
But

436
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,600
you will get scared right away

437
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:59,167
if he gives you the cold shoulder again.

438
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,867
Such a cycle repeats forever.

439
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,933
No matter how determined you are,

440
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:09,633
you cannot avoid
emotional ups and downs.

441
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:14,100
Kotoko,

442
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,967
you have been in love with someone.
I can tell it.

443
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,767
That's not true.

444
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,267
I can tell that...

445
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,000
...Irie...

446
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:44,333
...really loves

447
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,733
you.

448
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,900
He is totally in love with you.

449
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,667
How do you know that for sure?

450
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,667
How do I know?

451
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:02,033
I cannot answer that.

452
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,533
But I think that I am right about that.

453
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,433
So don't worry.

454
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,900
-I'm sorry to disturb your family party.
-Don't be.

455
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,267
Mr. Irie,

456
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:27,067
take care of yourself.

457
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:30,100
As soon as I return to my office,
I will pay you a visit.

458
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,400
First we will have formal
engagement ceremony.

459
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,800
-Is that right, Naoki and Sahoko?
-Yes.

460
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,267
I appreciate your help.

461
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:41,300
Mr. Irie, let's discuss the date later.

462
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:45,100
Sure. Thank you for coming today.

463
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:47,133
Let's go, Sahoko.

464
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,233
I will take a walk with Naoki
before going home.

465
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,900
Naoki, you don't mind?

466
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,600
Of course not. I will take her home.

467
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,833
Thank you.

468
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,400
Good-bye, everyone.

469
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,600
Good-bye.

470
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,400
You want to go?

471
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,067
Sure.

472
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,033
I'm so tired.

473
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,400
They violated our territory.
I should sprinkle salt for purification.

474
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,500
Honey, calm down.

475
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,767
Are you sure about this?

476
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:54,533
It's Naoki's decision.

477
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:56,767
We can't do anything.

478
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,767
Kotoko, do it tomorrow.

479
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,333
You must be tired, too.

480
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,233
I'm not sleepy yet,
so I will finish the dishes.

481
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,933
It was a busy day. You must be tired.

482
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,333
You can go to bed now.

483
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,333
But I feel bad for you.

484
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,033
Don't worry. I can finish it quickly.

485
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:44,467
Kotoko.

486
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,767
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,767
I'm really sorry.

488
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,667
I kept telling you that

489
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:04,167
you would be our daughter-in-law.

490
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,733
But it didn't go as I expected.

491
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,467
I tried to help you two get closer.

492
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:11,733
But at the end

493
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,567
it hurt you.

494
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,867
I feel very sorry.

495
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:23,733
That's not your fault.

496
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm still hoping that

497
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,800
you will marry my son.

498
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,367
Thank you.

499
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,733
You really love me, huh?

500
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm so honored.

501
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,267
You are

502
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:56,067
like a real mother to me.

503
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,600
You will be my mother from now on,

504
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:04,300
no matter who Irie will marry.

505
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,600
Kotoko...

506
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You mean it?

507
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,167
I'm home.

508
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,967
It took you so long, huh?

509
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,167
Where are my parents?

510
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,067
Already in bed?

511
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,767
Yes.

512
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,900
I see.

513
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,967
Good night.

514
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,167
Hey.

515
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:04,100
Sahoko is a nice lady.

516
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:07,600
She is pretty and a good cook.

517
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,000
That's not what I meant.

518
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
After we talked, I'm convinced that

519
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:17,400
she really loves you.

520
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,733
Now I understand

521
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,467
why you are totally in love with her.

522
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:36,167
You find a good guy. Okay?

523
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,867
AIHARA
IN PREPARATION

524
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,833
Good morning.

525
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,167
Good morning.

526
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,300
You are the only one?

527
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,800
Where are Kin-chan and Mr. Odawara?

528
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:38,433
They are out for shopping.

529
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,300
I see.

530
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,933
Then I will do the cleaning.

531
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,700
Hey, Kotoko. You have a moment?

532
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,633
We need to talk
before the restaurant opens.

533
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,100
Dad, what do you want?

534
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,133
We must leave Irie's house.

535
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,200
I'm sure you realized
everything yesterday.

536
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:19,767
Naoki is serious about the marriage.

537
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,300
If that's the case,

538
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,567
it's awkward for us to live with them.

539
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:31,533
The Oizumi family doesn't like you
to keep living with Naoki.

540
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,733
You should step aside.

541
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:43,367
That's why we should move out.

542
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:48,000
An old house? A small house?
I don't care.

543
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,333
I guess you are right.

544
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,433
I know it's so hard for you.

545
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,100
I'm not cool.

546
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,267
I promised myself not to give up on Irie

547
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:56,533
no matter how hurt I got.

548
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,767
Despite that...

549
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,367
It's important to know when to quit.

550
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:10,600
Naoki may be impressed
if you give up in a dignified way.

551
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:26,467
I hope you will forget

552
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:28,633
about Naoki soon.

553
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:09,667
<i>How many times have I wished</i>
<i>upon a shooting star?</i>

554
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,867
<i>But I must</i>

555
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:21,367
<i>stop doing that.</i>

556
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,133
Honey, don't make such a sad face.

557
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,833
I can't help it.

558
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,367
He will be engaged formally.

559
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:53,367
This is the worst day of my life.

560
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:55,633
Come on, honey.

561
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,633
I don't mean to depress you more,

562
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,033
but remember that we still have a wedding
ceremony and a wedding party.

563
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,767
Don't tell me that.

564
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,233
I'm going to cry.

565
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,167
I'm sorry.

566
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,333
Father and Mother, it's time to go.

567
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,133
Right. Let's go.

568
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,167
Mother.

569
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,967
Fine.

570
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:28,467
Hello, Kotoko.

571
00:45:28,633 --> 00:45:30,600
Good morning, Kin-chan.

572
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,033
Good morning.

573
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,833
Good morning.

574
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,367
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

575
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,600
Let's begin.

576
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:38,633
Please accept it.

577
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,767
I will accept it with great humility.

578
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,267
I will keep it

579
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:48,100
forever.

580
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,833
I will accept it with great humility.

581
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,633
I will keep it forever.

582
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,833
What do you want to eat?

583
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,633
What do you feel like right now?

584
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,300
How about Okonomiyaki?

585
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:08,933
Yes, your Okonomiyaki.
I haven't eaten it for a while.

586
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,533
You like my takoyaki, too.

587
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,000
<i>Right now Irie is...</i>

588
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:28,667
Kotoko?

589
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,600
Are you okay?

590
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,933
Why am I not?

591
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,600
Where do you want to go today?

592
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,633
I would like to go
to a video arcade again.

593
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,333
I want you to grab a stuffed animal
for me.

594
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,967
It's so cute with a red hat.

595
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,233
Let's get married.

596
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,200
Will you marry me?

597
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,867
How did you know that I wanted this?

598
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,733
I told you.

599
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:21,967
I know what you think.

600
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,467
Ms. Kotoko Aihara,

601
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,600
will you marry me?

602
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:32,933
Did Kin-chan propose to you?

603
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:36,533
Kin-chan is a better match for you than
Irie.

604
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,267
It is my dearest Sahoko's wedding.

605
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,300
I can't back out now.

606
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:43,833
Let's run a restaurant together to serve
the best home cuisine.

607
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,433
That is my dream.

608
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,867
I have endured a one-sided love
for many years.

609
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:50,500
I'm tired of the hopeless love.

610
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,767
I will leave the house.

611
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:56,633
{\an8}Everything is about to end.

612
00:50:56,733 --> 00:50:59,167
{\an8}You two are a perfect match.

613
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:00,433
{\an8}THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
