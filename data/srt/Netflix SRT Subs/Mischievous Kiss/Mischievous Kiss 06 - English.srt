1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,533
The couple that kisses
on the graduation day

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,000
will stay together forever.

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,933
Look over there.

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,733
Kiss?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,500
First kiss.

6
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:17,533
Among those three years,
this last year was the most fun for me.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,633
For the past 18 years for me,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,167
this last year was the most suffering.

9
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:26,633
You and I aren't good at studying,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,467
but we can find something
that we're good at.

11
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,400
If I find it

12
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:36,100
and succeed in it,
would you fall for me?

13
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:41,267
She finally came to realize

14
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,667
who treats her the best.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,033
Kin-chan, we're here.

16
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:51,867
Irie and Kotoko are meant
to be together.

17
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,067
-Stop kidding.
-You cold-blooded guy.

18
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,567
You love that cold-blooded guy,
don't you?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,867
<i>I...</i>

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,267
<i>...kissed with</i>

21
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,100
<i>Irie, didn't I?</i>

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,367
You come with me.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,533
What now?

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,900
I'll

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,067
stop loving you.

26
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:48,100
You are going to forget about me.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,100
Why don't you try, then.

28
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,867
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:31,000
I've been embarrassed
since that day that

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,000
I couldn't follow my heart.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,233
It was a dream.

32
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:29,700
<i>Since that day, I wake up</i>
<i>with this kind of dream.</i>

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,000
<i>However</i>

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
<i>let alone the second kiss,</i>

35
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:43,567
<i>but the relationship between Irie</i>
<i>and me hasn't progressed.</i>

36
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,367
<i>The short spring break is over.</i>

37
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,167
<i>Irie and I</i>

38
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,567
<i>are college students starting today.</i>

39
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:17,367
Tonan University
The day of the entrance ceremony

40
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,600
-Hey.
-Yes.

41
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,033
How long are you going to follow me?

42
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:27,067
Are you going to the School
of Science and Engineering?

43
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,600
Right. I'm at the School
of Literature. See you.

44
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,367
So you end up coming
to the school of Engineering

45
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,800
to spy on Irie?

46
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,967
Kotoko, you haven't progressed
at all since high school.

47
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,800
It's such a stable quality of Kotoko.

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,633
There are only men in the school
of Science and Engineering.

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,567
That'll keep Irie away from ladies.

50
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,100
Kotoko, you're safe.

51
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,533
Kotoko, look at her.

52
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,633
Who is that pretty girl?

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,333
Amazing.
In the men-dominated campus,

54
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,633
it looks shiny around her.

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,633
Irie.

56
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,800
Naoki Irie.

57
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,967
Have you decided on electives?

58
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,767
No, I haven't.

59
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,433
What should I take?

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,133
Whoa! Hey, Jinko, Satomi.

61
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,733
What do you want?

62
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,900
The desks
of the Engineering department.

63
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,800
I was wondering how they'd be like.

64
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,767
-She's hopeless.
-Right.

65
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,867
Is she your girlfriend?

66
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,233
No way.

67
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,700
<i>No way?</i>

68
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:51,900
<i>Even though we kissed,</i>
<i>does he still say "no way"?</i>

69
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,500
<i>What's going to happen</i>
<i>to my college life?</i>

70
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:01,700
MISCHIEVOUS KISS

71
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,067
He kissed you?

72
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,333
You both are too loud.

73
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
{\an8}How can I not be loud?

74
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,133
{\an8}RIVAL APPEARS!? HARDSHIP OF LOVE

75
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,767
{\an8}That Irie kissed you?

76
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,000
{\an8}His attitude didn't seem
like that at all.

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,633
I know.

78
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,267
It serves you right.

79
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,533
I don't understand what Irie's thinking.

80
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,233
Stop being so weak-spirited.

81
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,033
You dedicated your important
first kiss to Irie.

82
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,333
Right. You have to stay strong.

83
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,233
We're college freshmen.

84
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,000
Besides it's springtime.
It's time to meet new people.

85
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,600
If you don't do anything,
Irie will be taken by that pretty girl.

86
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,733
Aihara

87
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,933
Welcome.

88
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,667
Ai-chan, here we are availing
ourselves of your kind offer.

89
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,100
Tonight is the cerebration of Naoki
and Kotoko's college entrance.

90
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,300
-Please, take a seat over there.
-Thank you. Let's sit down.

91
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,100
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

92
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:40,867
Here.

93
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,767
It's a nice restaurant with good taste.

94
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,400
Isn't it? Ai-chan told me that

95
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,267
this paper is the best quality
washi paper.

96
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,700
-Really?
-Yeah.

97
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,567
You can't make a mess.

98
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,667
These chopsticks
are the best quality too.

99
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,467
You can't make it dirty.

100
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,100
I can't eat anything, then.

101
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,033
I'll use my hands.

102
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,133
Welcome.

103
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,500
Kin-chan!

104
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,000
Guess who.
You have a different aura.

105
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,933
I couldn't tell at all.

106
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,600
You look better this way.

107
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,933
Well, thank you, madam.

108
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,133
How come you're at Aihara?

109
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm aiming at becoming a chef
and being trained at this restaurant.

110
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:33,700
I see. Kin-chan,
you've been good at cooking.

111
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:37,300
From the professional's view,
my cooking is nothing.

112
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,133
But I'll try hard and get better
than your dad

113
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,700
then I'll become the best chef
in Japan.

114
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,667
I'll never lose against you.

115
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,333
I'll become an accomplished chef

116
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,867
and earn lots of money,
then I'll come get you,

117
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,367
so be ready for it.

118
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Kinnosuke, how long
are you chit-chatting?

119
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,233
Yes. Sorry. I'm coming.

120
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
Kotoko, serve these for me.

121
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:04,633
Okay.

122
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:30,400
This is so uneven
that we can't offer it to customers.

123
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,167
-I'm sorry.
-Give it to me.

124
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,567
-Fold them nicely one by one.
-Yes.

125
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

126
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,067
Thank you.

127
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,533
It was delicious.

128
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,500
-Kin-chan.
-Yeah.

129
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,067
You found your way to take.

130
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,133
How wonderful. Work hard for it.

131
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,367
Yeah. You work hard at college.

132
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,233
I will.

133
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,333
Jinko and Satomi are.

134
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,500
Cut it like pushing out
with the blade.

135
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,700
Yes.

136
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,767
It's still too thick.

137
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,033
Yes.

138
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,667
It's your turn for the bath.

139
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
Well, Irie.

140
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,400
What?

141
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,067
Well...

142
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,200
the lady at the School of Science
and engineering.

143
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,100
-Yuko Matsumoto?
-What?

144
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,100
You remember her full name
already?

145
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,667
I never forget when I hear it once.

146
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,833
Well, I'm wondering

147
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
if Ms. Matsumoto
has a feeling towards you.

148
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,033
What? Are you jealous?

149
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:53,733
It's not that.

150
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:56,833
You're right.

151
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,600
Matsumoto is definitely pretty.

152
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,033
She's got a nice figure.

153
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,067
She's also smart. She told me that
she made it to the 5th in national.

154
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,767
Why is that kind of person
in our college?

155
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,000
Who knows.

156
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,500
Maybe she has other goal.

157
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,800
Now...

158
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,767
weren't you going to forget about me?

159
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,633
Right.

160
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,200
Our relationship is serious enough
to kiss.

161
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,400
Can't you forget about me anymore?

162
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,233
<i>Is this going to be</i>

163
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,700
<i>the second one?</i>

164
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:02,233
<i>I'm being made fun of.</i>

165
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,433
<i>Irie doesn't</i>

166
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,433
<i>think anything about kissing me.</i>

167
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,700
How humiliating.

168
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,233
That girl's name is Yuko Matsumoto?

169
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,233
Beautiful and smart.

170
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
She's just like a female version
of Irie.

171
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:25,967
They're kind of suited
for each other.

172
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,100
Don't say such ominous thing.

173
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,300
You have to face the reality.

174
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,000
That girl is targeting Irie
without a doubt.

175
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,833
Kotoko, you're in a big crisis.

176
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,433
Let's eat and cheer up.

177
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
What will I eat?

178
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,567
Lunch A

179
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,633
Kotoko.

180
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,233
-Kotoko?
-Huh?

181
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,567
Haven't you ordered, yet?

182
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,233
Well, I was in a daze.

183
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,800
-Sorry.
-What are you doing? We'll go now.

184
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,800
Let's see. Lunch A is a hamburger.

185
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,333
Lunch B is fried shrimp.

186
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,367
Can't you think unless
you say it aloud?

187
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,633
Lunch A for me.

188
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,667
Well, I.

189
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,100
There's no lunch F here.

190
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,000
Lunch A for me too.

191
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,600
Two lunch A's.

192
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:38,867
What's this difference?

193
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,233
What is it, customer?
Are you complaining?

194
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,967
You're complaining about my fair serving.

195
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,300
What a nerve you have.

196
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,733
Kin-chan?

197
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,233
Hey!

198
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,400
What are you doing?

199
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,267
Haven't you found your way
to take?

200
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:59,267
You work at my dad's restaurant,
right?

201
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,567
Right.

202
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,400
At night at your dad's place

203
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,633
and during the day I work
at this cafeteria.

204
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,733
The taste that's affordable
for students,

205
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,500
the taste of the high-end restaurant
can be learned. Nice, huh?

206
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:15,300
Besides I have to save Kotoko
from the evil right there.

207
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
How about that, Mr. Genius?
Too surprised to speak, huh?

208
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,167
I'm impressed.

209
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,533
How can you decide your life
around a woman?

210
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,033
No, I can't.

211
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,000
What did you just say?

212
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,933
You two enjoy yourselves now.

213
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:43,533
He must have scared of
Mr. Kin-chan's power of love.

214
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,033
Right, Kotoko?

215
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,500
In a way, Kin-chan is right.

216
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:01,933
Humans tend to be conscious
about opposite sex who's close.

217
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:23,033
Kotoko, you should learn
from Kin-chan.

218
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,733
Right. Even though you're in the
same school, Irie is in Engineering.

219
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,467
You're in Literature.
The campus is different.

220
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:36,067
It's not going to be the same
as high school.

221
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,900
Yuko Matsumoto, who's in the same
school has far more advantage.

222
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,567
Moreover, she's a beautiful girl
with a nice figure.

223
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,200
No.

224
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,533
Hey, there you are, Irie.

225
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,867
-Hello, Mr. Sudo.
-Hey.

226
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,100
Who's that dude?

227
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,767
I don't know.

228
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:05,200
Upperclassman? Or a professor?

229
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,533
You know why I'm here, right?

230
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:12,533
Why don't you join our club?

231
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,833
I have no intention on
joining a club.

232
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,100
Don't you say stuff like that.

233
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:20,167
You and I know each other since
elementary school, don't we?

234
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,067
I'll be waiting for you
after school.

235
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,067
Okay?

236
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,433
Right?

237
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,767
Adios!

238
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:31,500
Kotoko.

239
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,533
You've got a chance.

240
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,433
Join the same club as Irie.

241
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,433
Then even if your school is different,

242
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,567
you can be close to Irie all the time.

243
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,333
Right. It's your chance
to get rid of Yuko Matsumoto.

244
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,433
I see.

245
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,633
I'll do that.

246
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,633
-I'll take your shrimp.
-Okay.

247
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,800
It's good.

248
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,300
It's delicious.

249
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:03,233
Irie, are you joining a club?

250
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,733
What kind of a club
are you joining?

251
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,267
I'm not telling you.

252
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,133
Why not?

253
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,633
Because you might join with me.

254
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,400
Well.

255
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,267
That's not.

256
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:26,033
-He read your mind.
-That's genius all over.

257
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,033
I'm not giving up. Good!

258
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,633
Good!

259
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,700
<i>That guy with the mustache</i>

260
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:00,100
<i>said he'd be waiting for him after school.</i>

261
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:06,067
<i>If I follow him I'll know</i>
<i>which club that is.</i>

262
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:42,067
<i>Anyway, there are so many</i>
<i>different clubs.</i>

263
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,567
<i>Which club is Irie joining?</i>

264
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh, that one.

265
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,533
I want to join you.

266
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,133
Anime Club

267
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,100
Anime club?

268
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,067
Well... is Irie here?

269
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,367
Irie?

270
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,700
Who is that?

271
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,300
Isn't that a guy who just came in
and left?

272
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,433
Excuse me now.

273
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,700
Brass band members wanted.
No experience necessary.

274
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,733
You're late.
I told you to go together.

275
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,967
That's just what you said by yourself.

276
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,267
Okay.

277
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:05,900
But we're going to join the same club
so may as well, right?

278
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,933
Same club?

279
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,333
Let's go in.

280
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,000
All right.

281
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:19,267
Excuse me, I want to join too.

282
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,867
Well, who are you?
Do you have an invitation?

283
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,933
Well, I don't have any invitation,

284
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,800
but I really want to join

285
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:39,167
the tennis club.
When I'd enter Tonan University,

286
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,267
I definitely wanted to join this club.
I was yearning for it.

287
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,300
Please consider me.

288
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,400
Isn't it great, captain?

289
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,467
We welcome passionate people.

290
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,900
What's your name?

291
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,567
Kotoko Aihara.

292
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,367
Kotoko-chan, come on in.

293
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,700
I'm in charge of freshmen, Sudo.

294
00:25:57,867 --> 00:26:01,767
We're having a welcome party
for newcomers. Join us.

295
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,367
-You're over here.
-Right.

296
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,800
I'll give you a rundown.

297
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,933
If you have questions ask Sudo.

298
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,400
I'll tell you anything except for
my cell number. It's 0120.

299
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:21,133
-How do you like it?
-Wow, great!

300
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,733
Can I wear this?

301
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,700
I'm so happy
that you're playing tennis.

302
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:29,233
I was a pretty good player
when I was young.

303
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,467
-You were?
-I was.

304
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:35,500
It's me who taught Naoki tennis
for the first time.

305
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,933
Look, Naoki.

306
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,933
Isn't Kotoko's clothes adorable?
How do you like it?

307
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,467
I don't think you should go
by the looks.

308
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,767
Aren't you guys doing well?

309
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,833
Because you and Naoki
are joining the same club.

310
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,800
You both must be in love.

311
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,333
Not at all.

312
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:10,333
-Irie is popular.
-He is?

313
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,467
Mrs. Irie.

314
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:23,867
Does Irie like beautiful
and smart woman?

315
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:27,433
Is there such a girl for him?

316
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,867
Wow, Naoki is popular
than I thought.

317
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,067
Even though he's so unfriendly.

318
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:39,600
You'll be okay.

319
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,033
Go over to the school
of Engineering

320
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,333
and keep working on him.

321
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
No matter what kind of woman
comes by

322
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:50,533
you're the best for Naoki.

323
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,633
I don't know.

324
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,400
I've been living with both of you

325
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,000
and kept watching you so I know.

326
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,367
Do your best.

327
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,533
Yes.

328
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:08,700
Hold the racket. Strike a pose.
You look good.

329
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,600
Do it. Right.

330
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,267
Receive. Good. It's this next.

331
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,267
Do like this.

332
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,567
All right. I'll get my love
with this energy.

333
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,000
You look good, Kotoko.

334
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,200
What are you doing?

335
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,467
Serve.

336
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,567
Good job, Kotoko. Nice!

337
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,767
Okay, freshmen.

338
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:15,100
It's the first day today
so we'll have tryouts.

339
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,167
It's just to see your skills.

340
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,733
-Do your best.
-Yes.

341
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,467
<i>What? I didn't know</i>
<i>that there was a tryout.</i>

342
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:29,867
You'll match with Sudo who's a Junior
and in charge of freshmen.

343
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:32,700
I'm Sudo. Good to see you guys.

344
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:36,000
Good to see you.

345
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,233
I'm relieved that it's Sudo.

346
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
You don't know anything, yet.

347
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,333
What do you mean?

348
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,733
He seems to be changed.

349
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,767
Let's start with Wada.

350
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,633
Me first?

351
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,667
Did you think I'd start from the top
of the list? Loser!

352
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,367
I'm the guy who's unpredictable.

353
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,000
Wada.

354
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,567
Come to the court.

355
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,467
Why are you idling there, Wada.

356
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,533
-Attack with your whole body.
-He's called as the Evil Sudo.

357
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,200
More.

358
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,567
Next, Yada.

359
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,333
-Come in.
-Yes.

360
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:00,600
Sudo has been known

361
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:03,567
for his personality change
when he held a racket

362
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:06,867
ever since he was in
an elementary school.

363
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,700
Although he's usually peaceful.

364
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:12,700
Next.

365
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,067
Miyamoto. Come on in.

366
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,667
yes.

367
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,100
Matsumoto is on fire.

368
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,067
She was in the best four in women's single
when she was in high school.

369
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,900
Her grades are good also,

370
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,833
so she could have gone
to any college if she wanted to.

371
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:07,300
The tennis club in Tonan
is prestigious.

372
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,700
How do you know that?

373
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:14,467
She asked me when we were
applying to colleges.

374
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:18,633
I've known her since freshman in
high school at national competition.

375
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,933
<i>When I was a freshman</i>
<i>in high school,</i>

376
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,667
<i>Irie didn't know me.</i>

377
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:33,500
<i>I was just watching him.</i>

378
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,067
<i>That means Ms. Matsumoto</i>
<i>has longer history with Irie.</i>

379
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,933
I feel like I'd lose.

380
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,600
Okay, Matsumoto. As expected.
Great job.

381
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,367
Thank you.

382
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,867
Next.

383
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,333
Naoki Irie.

384
00:32:58,733 --> 00:32:59,800
Come in.

385
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:02,000
Yes.

386
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,700
Finally, the day has come.

387
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:09,633
Yes. Please don't be too hard on me.

388
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,667
Like I'm not going to be hard on you.

389
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,433
Irie is fantastic.

390
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:53,700
Okay, that's it.
Irie, move out of the court.

391
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,700
Wait, Irie. One more time.

392
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,100
Sudo.

393
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,367
It's a tryout today.

394
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,300
No, one more time.

395
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,400
Amazing, that Naoki Irie. As I heard.

396
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,133
Look at Sudo's expression.

397
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Irie made him mad.
The next one will face that rat.

398
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:21,533
Next, Kotoko Aihara.

399
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,800
Come in.

400
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,433
Don't walk slowly.

401
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,200
Wait!

402
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,633
It's the first time for me
to play tennis.

403
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,300
Shut up. Here I come.

404
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,167
What's up with her?

405
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,133
Wait, don't run away.
Hold your racket.

406
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,533
Open your eyes.
Here's another one.

407
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,567
Oh, my gosh, Aihara fainted.

408
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,400
There.

409
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,267
Are you okay, Kotoko?

410
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:05,367
Kotoko is so lame as usual.

411
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:07,433
Yuki.

412
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,667
Kotoko, why don't you take a break
from practice tomorrow.

413
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:15,667
Freshmen are not allowed
to miss practices.

414
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,700
I'll be okay.
I'll get used to it soon.

415
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,333
You're a girl. Don't kill yourself.

416
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,567
Yes.

417
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:23,233
Do you have any other scratches?

418
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,167
I think I'm okay.

419
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,400
I'm a little sore, though.

420
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,000
Aihara
We're getting ready

421
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,433
Chef, what should I do with these?

422
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,733
Wash and peel them.

423
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,367
Yes.

424
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,700
Hey, Kinnosuke.

425
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:02,800
Yes.

426
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,867
You work at college during the day, right?

427
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,067
Yes.

428
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,467
How's Kotoko doing at college?

429
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,433
She hasn't changed since high school.

430
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:22,567
She can't be the same.
She's in a good age.

431
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:28,633
Well...that.

432
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,067
Boyfriend or somebody?

433
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,700
If that's your concern,

434
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:36,033
I'm watching her not to get a bad one.

435
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,600
Then how about Naoki?

436
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,700
Chef, don't worry.

437
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,033
I'll always protect her
from his evil hands.

438
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,933
Besides, at college,
they go to different buildings.

439
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,600
Compared to high school,

440
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:58,300
the distance between them
seems to be way farther.

441
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:02,333
It shows that justice will conquer.

442
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,233
Hey, Kinnosuke...kun.

443
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:13,400
-Yes.
-Can you deliver a message for me?

444
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:23,100
Kotoko, is your face okay?

445
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,667
Ouch, it hurts!

446
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:28,167
I heard that the tennis club in Tonan
is seriously athletic.

447
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,333
They're so strict
that most newcomers quit.

448
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,233
They end up with a couple
of them left every year.

449
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,000
Kotoko, are you sure you can
keep going?

450
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,867
It's for me to be close to Irie.
I'll do my best.

451
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,567
Quit it now.

452
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,433
Kin-chan.

453
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:49,633
Kotoko Love

454
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,333
Kin-chan, It's not fair that only
Kotoko gets it.

455
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,300
Do you have a problem?
I'll give you a hip shake.

456
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,933
It's Kin-chan special.

457
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,067
Hey, Kotoko.

458
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,467
Quit tennis.

459
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,700
You don't have to injure your pretty face
to do stuff like that.

460
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,100
Since I joined, I want to try hard.

461
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:14,933
It's not good to give it up
in the middle of it.

462
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,067
My dad taught me that.

463
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,300
Kotoko.

464
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:22,933
How courageous!

465
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:28,033
Oh, now I remember.
I have a message from your dad.

466
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,200
Come to Aihara tonight.

467
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:31,867
Why?

468
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:35,233
I don't know. He said he wanted
to discuss something with you.

469
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,500
-Eat it.
-Sure.

470
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,567
Let's eat.

471
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:43,900
You guys are eating too much
during our talk.

472
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:49,200
Stop kidding. You ate "Love."

473
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,133
You ate my love.

474
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,767
What are you doing.
Don't be so slow.

475
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,133
Yes.

476
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,000
Lower your hip more.

477
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,200
Yes.

478
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,533
You guys are lacking motivation.

479
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
This tennis club doesn't need
that kind of a guy.

480
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:07,133
Quit now.

481
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,800
-Do you want to quit?
-No.

482
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:14,233
Right? A river is flowing.

483
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,033
A forest is alive. We all are.

484
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,233
-Alive.
-That's right.

485
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,633
Time for a break. A break is over.

486
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,933
Listen.

487
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,600
There's no time for you to rest.

488
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,667
-Next, 100 sit-ups.
-Yes.

489
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,400
-Answer me.
-Yes.

490
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,900
One...

491
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,567
Together. One.

492
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,800
<i>Is this tennis club?</i>

493
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,600
<i>It's all conditioning.</i>

494
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:42,000
<i>Besides,</i>

495
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:46,533
<i>Irie and Yuko Matsumoto,</i>
<i>who joined together, aren't here.</i>

496
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,433
<i>What's going on?</i>

497
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,000
One.

498
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,200
Oh, my!

499
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:58,400
Sorry, Kotoko.
Could you throw it to me?

500
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,900
Wait.

501
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:04,567
There.

502
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,200
Hey you.

503
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,200
How come you're hitting balls
even though you're a freshman?

504
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,700
How about conditioning?

505
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,067
Oh, you didn't know?

506
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:16,633
Tonan tennis club goes
with players' abilities.

507
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,967
If one passed the tryout yesterday,

508
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:22,267
even a freshman can get priority
to practice on the court.

509
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,467
Is that right? Then is Irie there?

510
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,967
Irie is even more special.

511
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,733
He'll come whenever he feels like
and to the tournament.

512
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,000
That was his condition to join here.

513
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,167
Does that mean that he won't come
to the practice?

514
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:42,667
<i>Why did I join the tennis club for?</i>

515
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:48,833
A little bird told me that you lived
in the same house as he does.

516
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,600
However, you don't know much
about him.

517
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,567
I guess that's the kind of relationship
that you have.

518
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:05,000
Aihara,
what are you goofing off for?

519
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:08,500
As a punishment,
you'll run 100 rounds on the track.

520
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,900
-It was a great meal.
-Thank you.

521
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,900
Oh, Kotoko. Welcome.

522
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,467
Hey, Kinnosuke, when did I tell you
that you could leave your spot?

523
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,567
-You got lots of dishes to do.
-Sorry, bro.

524
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:34,700
See you at school, then.

525
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:39,000
What's wrong, Kotoko?

526
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,100
I'm just sore.

527
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,867
Anyway, what do you want
to talk about, Dad?

528
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,500
-I'm going to use the private room.
-Yes.

529
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:55,000
Are you okay?

530
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,133
Looks delicious.

531
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,533
I'm going to eat now.

532
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:18,767
It tastes much better after
working out.

533
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,167
You're not good at ball games,
are you?

534
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,700
You're not interested in it.
Why do you play tennis?

535
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:32,567
Is that because of Naoki?

536
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,167
Why are you being serious
all of a sudden?

537
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:38,667
Listen, Kotoko.

538
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
It's been almost a year since
we started living with Irie family.

539
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,833
I thought about many options,

540
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:54,133
but keep depending on Irie
family's kindness is not good.

541
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:01,567
Iri-chan and his wife
take good care of you.

542
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,300
To be honest,
I thought about you and Naoki

543
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:11,333
being together
in the future... possibly.

544
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,567
Dad.

545
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,667
However.

546
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,967
After watching you guys for a long time,

547
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:23,500
it doesn't seem like Naoki's feeling
is towards you at all.

548
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,300
Then it's not going to work.

549
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,633
With me again,

550
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:40,633
let's go back to live just two of us,
okay, Kotoko?

551
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,600
<i>Of course I want to consider</i>
<i>your feelings too.</i>

552
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:04,767
<i>But I found a good property nearby.</i>

553
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:09,200
<i>So please consider my feelings too.</i>

554
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:13,833
<i>For me,</i>

555
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:18,200
it's hard to see your heart broken.

556
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,667
<i>But if I</i>

557
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:28,133
<i>leave Irie family now,</i>

558
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:32,900
<i>the contact with Irie</i>

559
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,133
<i>will be gone for me.</i>

560
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:45,567
What are you dazing about?

561
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:48,233
Irie.

562
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:50,433
Are you going home now?

563
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,233
Where have you been?

564
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,067
It's none of your business.

565
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:58,867
What about you? You're late.

566
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,133
I was at my dad's restaurant.

567
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,467
-Your dad's restaurant?
-Yes.

568
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,233
I wondered

569
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,667
if you went to see that guy.

570
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:18,900
That guy?

571
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,700
No, never mind.

572
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:29,433
I was told that my dad
found a good property.

573
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,733
What?

574
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:39,167
Our new house.

575
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,967
He hasn't made a contract, yet.

576
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,067
See, my dad and I

577
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:51,667
are at your house
for almost a year, right?

578
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:56,033
So my dad thought about this
and that.

579
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,467
That's why.

580
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,167
Are you leaving my house?

581
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,500
If that happens...

582
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,333
Will you miss me?

583
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:32,133
Irie?

584
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,700
It's more like I can finally go back
to my regular life.

585
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,533
<i>I don't know.</i>

586
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,867
<i>I don't know</i>

587
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,733
<i>how Irie feels.</i>

588
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,467
<i>What...can I do?</i>

589
00:49:40,967 --> 00:49:41,900
I gave up on Irie.

590
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:42,800
NEXT EPISODE

591
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:43,967
You're kidding!

592
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,700
We'll match with doubles.

593
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:47,900
You team up with Kotoko Aihara.

594
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,700
-No kidding.
-Don't get in my way.

595
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:54,100
Accomplishing something together
might change Irie's mind.

596
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:56,767
The reason why you try hard
on tennis is because

597
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:00,200
-you want to be with Irie?
-We'll definitely win.

598
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:03,567
-You got it?
-Being a nuisance to your love

599
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,367
won't make you feel bad at all?

600
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,867
{\an8}DISCLAIMER:
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

601
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:09,867
{\an8}It's all over.
