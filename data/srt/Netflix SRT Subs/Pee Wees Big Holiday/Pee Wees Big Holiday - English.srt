1
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,083
Wow.

2
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,212
I can't believe
we're already saying goodbye.

3
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,591
It's been great getting to know you,
Pee-wee Herman.

4
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,178
Earth sure is a great planet.

5
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,432
Your art, music, pizza.

6
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,395
You sure took to our customs fast.

7
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,731
Thanks for showing them to me.

8
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,651
I've loved these last two weeks.

9
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,571
-I wish I didn't have to go.
-[Pee-wee sniffles]

10
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:35,990
Me, too.

11
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,952
Come with me, back to my planet.

12
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:42,038
Meet my family and friends.

13
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,874
Live with me.

14
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,291
I can't.

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,545
I need to stay here
with the people of Earth.

16
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm going to miss my new best friend.

17
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:57,261
I'll never forget you, Pee-wee.

18
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,389
I'll always remember you, too, Yul.

19
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,767
Look.

20
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,019
I made us both friendship bracelets.

21
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,395
[gasps]

22
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,566
Pee-wee, they're beautiful.

23
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,484
Let's put them on.

24
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,619
[sniffles]

25
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,748
I guess this is...

26
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,626
<i>arrivederci</i> then, right?

27
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,252
Right.

28
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,214
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Pee-wee Herman.

29
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,051
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Yul.

-[spaceship whirring]
-[both gasping]

31
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,074
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

32
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,577
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

33
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,831
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

34
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,291
-I can't leave home! I can't leave home!
-[alarm ringing]

35
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,626
-I can't leave home.
-[ringing continues]

36
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,338
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

37
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,716
[chuckles] Morning!

38

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,221
[laughing]

40
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,602
[chuckles] Ooh!

41
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,365

[laughs]

46
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,565
Ooh!

47
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,983
Apple-y! [chuckles]

48
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,361
-Good morning, Pee-wee!
-Morning, Mr. Murgatroyd!

49
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,948
[chuckles]

50
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,243

-Hi, kids! [grunts]

51
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,171
Ooh! Ooh! [chuckles]

[barking]

54
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,108
Hello! [chuckles]

55
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,651
[chuckles]

56
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,945
Breakfast bar!

57
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,447
Scone, French toast, American toast...

58
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,698
[sneezes]

59
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:09,078
Green grapes, sausages,
bacon, cinnamon toast!

60
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,831
Buh-bye!

61
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,377
[screaming]

62
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,221
Good morning, Pee-wee!

63
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,100
[Pee-wee grunts]

64
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,852
Good morning, Mrs. Rose!

65
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,938
[chuckles] Oh, look at you.

66
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,523
You're cute as a peanut!

67
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,484
-Ow!
-[both laughing]

68
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,071
Have you heard about
those new corduroy pillows?

69
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,615
-Corduroy pillows? No.
-[chuckles]

70
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,201
I'm surprised,
'cause they're making head lines!

71
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,452
[laughs]

72
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,371
Get it? "Head lines!"

73
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,872
Oh! [laughs]

74
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,001
-Hold on. Hey, Ruby!
-Morning, Pee-wee.

75
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,962
-Last stop, Nana's Yarn Barn!
-Oh!

76
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,215
[both exclaim]

77
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,634
[both laughing]

78
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,554
You're the sweetest boy in Fairville,
Pee-wee.

79
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,184
-Me?
-Is there anything sweeter than you?

80
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,145
Uh... a Root Beer Barrel?

81
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,273
-That's right!
-[chuckles]

82
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,193
I know they're in here somewhere.

83
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,904
There it is. [gasps]

84
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,157
No.
What was I looking for?

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,826
[gasps] Oh...

86
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,871
[laughs]

87
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,664
Root Beer Barrels are my favorite!

88
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,917
Boop! [chuckles]

89
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,009
Ah! [chuckles]

90
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,929
Well, listen, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run.

91
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,432
-Bye, Mrs. Rose!
-Bye-bye, Pee-wee.

92
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,059
[laughing]

[horn honking]

94
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,812
-Pee-wee!
-Yo, Billy!

95
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,524
-Hey, Pee-wee!
-Hey, Ben!

96
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,486
-Morning, Pee-wee!
-Kevin!

97
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,947
-[chuckles]
-Pee-wee!

98
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,574
I'm so glad I bumped into you.

99
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,910
I've got an amazing deal
I want to tell you about.

100
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,578
You're gonna have to tell me later,
Marvin.

101
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,996
I'm on my way to work. [chuckles]

102
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,333
Just a moment of your time.
Come on, Pee-wee.

103
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:24,129
Tell me, Pee-wee, where do you
picture yourself on vacation?

104
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,714
Mexico?

105
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,132
Or Morocco?

106
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,800
Mexico?

107
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,677
Morocco?

108
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,805
What is this?
A travel agency or a millinery?

109
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,142
Sorry, Marvin, I'm not interested.

110
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,352
[stutters] Come on, Pee-wee.

111
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,853
Don't you ever wonder

112
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,647
-what life is like outside Fairville?
-Nope!

113
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,319
Marvin, you know I don't want
to go anywhere or try anything new.

114
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,487
Bye! [chuckles]

115
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,209
[chuckles]

116
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,881
[chuckles] Phew!

117
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,925
[screams]

118
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,095
Emily, you scared me there for a moment.

119
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,597
I know I have overdue books.

120
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,557
I'm gonna return them soon, I promise.

121
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,144
-I don't care about silly overdue books.
-Oh?

122
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,230
But I do have something special
I wanted to give to you.

123
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,648
[chuckles]

124
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,066
Hmm.

125
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,321
[Pee-wee gasps] The new <i>Scuba Cop?</i>

126
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,863
<i>The Emerald Sharks?</i>

127
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,616
And the sharks are hammerheads?

128
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,619
These are the exact type of sharks
that Scuba Cop hates the most!

129
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,332
I haven't received your RSVP
for the Book Club tomorrow night.

130
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,375
I was thinking that, maybe afterwards,
you and I might--

131
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,295
Whoa, whoa!
Emily, let me stop you right there.

132
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,005
The fact is...

133
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,424
I neglected to RSVP my regrets.

134
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,801
I have rehearsal that night. NA.

135
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,471
-NA?
-Not available.

136
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,555
-Sorry.
-[chuckles]

137
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,390
Well, what time is your rehearsal?

138
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,100
Oh, uh, TBD.

139
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,727
-TBD?
-To be decided.

140
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,940
LATT, Em. IHTBG.

141
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,944
-[chuckles] What?
-LATT, IHTBG.

142
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,488
-IHT--
-"Look at the time."

143
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,573
"I have to be going."

144
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,616
You understand.

145
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,953
[horn honking]

146
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,081
Yay! Work time!

147
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,000
[chuckles]

148
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,751
[indistinct chatter]

149
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,509
Two eggs, fried, extra hash browns,
side of sausage. Enjoy!

150
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,387
Looks fantastic as always, Beverly.

151
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,596
[phone ringing]

152
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,474
Dan's Diner.
Dan speaking.

154
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,811
[chuckles]

155
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,611
-French toast is up, Bev!
-[bell dings]

156
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,739
Denver omelet.
Easy on the cheese.

157
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,534
Easy on the cheese-y, coming right up-y!

158
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,829
Boop. [chuckles]

159
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,293
Dudley! Sylvester! Clovis!
What are you guys doing here?

160
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,088
Pee-wee, we need to talk to you
about band rehearsal.

161
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,758
Well, it is unusual to be discussing
Renegades business at my workplace,

162
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,009
but, sure, what's up?

163
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,638
My promotion at the grocery store means
I'm gonna be working a lot more hours.

164
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,139
Nights.

165
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,851
Yeah, and my girlfriend's making me take
ballroom dancing with her

166
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,562
four times a week.

167
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,729
Nights.

168
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,275
My office just pressured me into joining
their nighttime bowling league.

169
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,401
Nights.

170
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,986
But the Renegades rehearse at night.

171
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,156
Hello? How's that gonna work
if all you guys are so busy at night?

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,408
It's not.

173
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,452
The Renegades are breaking up.

174
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,495
What?

175
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,831
-No!
-Things are changing.

176
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,460
None of us have enough time
to be in a band anymore.

177
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,544
I do!

178
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,421
That's because you're stuck in a rut,
Pee-wee.

179
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,047
We want to move on to other things.

180
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,007
What am I supposed to move on to?

181
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,009
What am I supposed to do
with my flutophone?

182
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,928
Why don't you think about a solo career?

183
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,721
Why don't you?

184
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,400
[Pee-wee] Good luck, you guys.

185
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,280
Good luck with all your stupid, important
reasons for breaking up the Renegades!

-Nice seeing you, Dan.
-Bye, Dan!

191
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,102
Pee-wee, I gotta say,
your French toast is perfection!

192
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,312
Thanks.

193
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:54,232
Same with your pancakes, Herman.
They drive me crazy!

194
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,443
Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.

195
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,945
I'm taking this biscuit with me.

196
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,030
I love it.

197
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,699
-Why don't you marry it?
-[all laugh]

198
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,327
Listen, you guys, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run, okay?

199
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,828
All right? Buh-bye!

200
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,996
-Thanks for coming.
-Later!

201
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,540
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

202
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,001
Hey, sport, can you watch over the diner?

203
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,295
I gotta go meet a couple pals
at the lodge.

204
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,632
Sure, Dan. I'll be right here.
Where else would I go?

205
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,259
Gonna be right here.
Just like always.

206
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,762
Have fun with your pals!

207
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,889

Sharks pulling off a jewel heist?
[chuckles]

212
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,802
It could happen,

213
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,097
but not if Scuba Cop happens to be
swimming around! [laughs]

Triple cool.

221
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,341
Uh, hi! What can I get you?

222
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,761
-Milkshake, please.
-Flavor?

223
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,555
Let's say chocolate.

224
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,265
Sure. Three, two, one.

225
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,851

Boop! Think fast!

238
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,979
Wow!

239
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,023

Wow, man!

246
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,877
This milkshake is outrageous.

247
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,879
I really mean it.
Probably... [inhales]

248
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,296
top five, all-time.

249
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,841
[chuckles] Thanks, my specialty.

250
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,968
You know what would go great
with a milkshake of this caliber?

251
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,261
[both] A Root Beer Barrel!

252
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,599
[both] Only the best candy in the world!

253
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,725
[both] It really is!

254
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,184
[both] Distant second?

255
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,854
[both] Charleston Chew. Third?

256
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,564
[both] Tie between two candies.

[both] Rolos and Skittles!

258
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:04,900
[both] Shut up!

259
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,484
[both] Shut up!

260
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,027
[both] Shut up.

261
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,742
Well, all right,
Mr. Master Milkshake Maker,

262
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,744
what do you say you show me around
this little burg of yours?

263
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,205
Me? A tour of Fairville?
I'd love to!

264
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,959
Oh, I can't.
I gotta watch over the diner.

265
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,252
-I promised Dan and Beverly--
-"Promised Dan and Beverly"?

266
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,005
Will you listen to yourself?
You sound like a little baby.

267
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,048
We'll only be gone ten minutes.

268
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,676
Chillax, man.
Live a little.

269
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,261
What?

270
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,514
Live a little.

271
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,601
[whispers] Live a little.

272
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,356

[motorcycle engine idling]

274
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,865
I have kind of limited experience
on a motorcycle.

275
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,241
Shh!

276
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,912
-You hear that?
-What?

277
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,332
It's the old highway callin'.
Get on.

278
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,542

-Wicked-awesome view, dude!
-[chuckles]

282
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,358
-And it's right in your backyard.
-I'm glad you like it.

283
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,195
It roughly corresponds
to the model scale HO-187.

284
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,155
Wow, this is a whole new world for me.

285
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,074
A miniature world!

286
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,283
[both laughing]

287
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,661
A miniature world.

288
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,998
I mean, look at the detail.
It's breathtaking.

289
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,875
You got a real gift, man.

290
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,001
Thank you.

291
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,712
Hey, how about that tour of Fairville?

292
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,257
Right over there, that's Dan's Diner,
where we met.

293
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,427
And there, Fairville Public Library.

294
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,096
Fairville High.

295
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,098

Barber of Fairville.

298
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,644
And this right here,

299
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,523
this little building is where Fairville's
premier music group, the Renega--

300
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,485
-What's wrong? What's that building?
-Nothing.

301
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,821
It's just some stupid building

302
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,282
where my stupid band used to rehearse
before we broke up!

303
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,951
Let me get that right out of there.

304
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,788
[Pee-wee grunts]
Stupid! Stupid!

305
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,457

[yelling continues]

307
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,671
You okay?

308
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,091
Yeah, sure. I'm fine. [chuckles]

309
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,843
Hey! What's that?

310
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,888
[chuckles] Is that your house?

311
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,640
I didn't notice you had a tree house.

312
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:43,725
Oh, I don't.

313
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,853
That's the only detail
of this entire model that doesn't exist...

314
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:47,896
yet.

315
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,522
-[both laugh]
-That's funny.

316
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,524
You know, I always wanted
a tree house, too.

317
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,317
That is funny!

319
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,114
Say...

320
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,742
What do you say you and me
get a picture of us

321
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,619
at the site of your future tree house?

322
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,039
You ready?
Three, two, one.

00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,791
-[both] Root Beer Barrels!
-[shutter clicking]

Oh, it's Pee-wee. Pee-wee Herman.
And you are?

Uh... what?

328
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,973
Wait...

329
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,182
you don't know who I am?

330
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,309
How could I?
Why would I?

331
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,145
I'm Joe...

332
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,312

Sorry, trick ear.
One more time.

337
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,781
I'm an actor.

338
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,533
I'm told show business
can be very competitive,

339
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,536
so hang on to your dreams
and who knows? [chuckles]

340
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,413
I wish you luck, Joe Man... [mumbling]

341
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,458
-Certainly you've heard of <i>True Blood?</i>
-Uh-uh.

342
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,962
<i>-Magic Mike?</i>
-Hmm, you'd think so, but no.

343
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,964
Man, you're so real.

344
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,924
That's what I like about you, Pee-wee.
You're normal.

345
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,342
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

346
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,845
[exclaims]
Your miniature world is awesome.

347
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,516
Hey, what's on the other side
of those railroad tracks?

348
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,976
Beyond Fairville?

349
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,145
I don't know, I've never been there.

350
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,188
Never?

351
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,983
May I tell you something
I've never told anyone?

352
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,527
Sure.

353
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,653
What is it?

354
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,280
Once upon a time, I won a contest.

355
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,075
A trip to Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,628

[sighs] Hmm...

363
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,387
[stutters] Do you ever get worried
that life's just passing you by?

364
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,763
Ha!

365
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,350
What could possibly be going on out there
that I haven't tried already in Fairville?

366
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,728
-You ever been in a fight?
-No.

367
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,605
-You ever broken a rule?
-No!

368
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,107
You ever had two women fight over you?

369
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,358
Uh...

370
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,902
Have I? No.

371
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,489
Breaking rules and breaking hearts,
that's what life's all about.

372
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,075
I believe in fate.

373
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,784
And I think I know why you and I met.

374
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,455
You're gonna leave Fairville...

375
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,875
and you're gonna take a holiday.

376
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,877
I got your reason right here.

377
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,171
What is it? What?

378
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,886
I want you to be at my birthday party.

379
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,056
New York City! [chuckles]

380
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,348
How would I ever...

381
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,102
[stammering] I couldn't possibly...

382
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,187
This is all happening so fast.

383
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,980
See you in five days, brother.

384
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,524
"Five days"?
"Brother"?

385
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,194
-I've never even been on an airplane.
-No!

386
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,362
The only thing you're gonna
learn about yourself on a plane

387
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:47,117
is that you like the honey-roasted peanuts
better than the plain-salted.

388
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,535
If you're really hungry,

389
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,289
the open road is a smorgasbord
of life experience.

390
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:57,294
A few days on the open road
is worth a lifetime in Fairville.

391
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,962
The way I see it, Pee-wee Herman,

392
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,672
you got a choice to make.

393
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,424
Stick around here...

What should I do?

400
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,903
I wish I had some kind of sign.

401
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,200
Whoa, that's a big apple.

402
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,577
Big Apple!

403
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,454
That's it! Bingo!

I'm starving!

Pee-wee, where have you been?

I'm leaving town.

412
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:00,190
I won't be at work tomorrow
or the next day or the day after that.

536
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,422
There's a bag of groceries on your roof!

537

[both laughing]

540
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,307
Bingo.

541
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,895
Ew! Snake farm, yuck.

542
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,106
Ugh, I hate snakes.

543
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:42,401
One of the area's
most popular attractions!

544
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,112
And, it just so happens, our next stop.

545
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,574
I supply their gift shop. [chuckles]

546
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,618
These...

547
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,579
are what I call "the classics."

548
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,665
-The big-sellers.
-[gasps]

549
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:59,877

550
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,547
-[chuckles]
-Please do not touch the merchandise,

551
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,633
however tempted you may be.

552

-I won't, I promise.
-Okay.

553
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,220
-Hey, what's that over there?
-Hmm?

554
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,517
[rustling]

555
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,979
I think that's a...

556
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,815

-Oh!

557
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,566
-Forgot that word.
-[both laughing]

558
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,319
Ooh, pecan logs.

560
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,238
Here.

561
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:32,284
A solar-powered calculator
the size of a business card.

562
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,536
-[gasps]
-Complimentary.

563
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,829
Ooh, thanks.

564
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:39,124
Want anything else?
I'm feeling generous.

565
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,504
Top Secret Disguise Kit?

566
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,172
Wise choice!

567
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,049
It's yours.

568
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,051
You never know when
you're gonna need one of those.

569
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,557

571
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,150

Ew! Snake farm.

573
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,657
Yuck. Ugh!

574
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,450
Have I mentioned I hate snakes?

575
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:14,952
Ah, Pee-wee.

576
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,696
[speaking Spanish]

577
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,076

580
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,342

581
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:14,845
Blech!

582
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,054
Yuck.

583
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,723
Ugh!

584
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,689
-I think I'll just wait out here.

585
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:26,983
Come on.

586
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:31,278
By the time we leave this place,
I bet you'll be a snake lover, Pee-wee.

587
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,613
Bet me!

588
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,948
Come on.

589
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:41,413
Baby rattlers are the most dangerous,
because their venom is the strongest.

590
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,591
-That's stupid.
-[laughs]

591
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:56,178
Come on, I can't wait
for you to see this place.

592
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,181
They got a snake in here
as big as that bus.

593
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:05,270
Clay and Jimmy, behold the Cuatro Fuego.

594
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,192
Light four flames at the same time.

595
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,237
-[exclaiming]
-[laughing]

596
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,239
What do you think, honey?

597
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,449
We'll take four boxes.

598
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,702
-Deal.
-Deal.

599
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,995
[both laughing]

600
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,177
Lame.

601
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,346
Yawn.

602
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,472
Stupid.

603
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:43,934
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, as always.

604
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,063
How you liking the Snake Farm, Pee-wee?

605
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,898
I thought it would be a little scarier.

606
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,649
You want scary, huh?

607
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,486
If you're really looking to see
something scary...

608
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,655
who's he gotta see, Jimmy?

609
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,240
The Monster.

610
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,702
That is, if you're brave enough.

611
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,662
I think I could handle it.

612
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,288
Well, let's go.

No such thing in the heartland, stranger.

Well--

Say no more.

655
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,807

I'm not gonna make it.

842
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,596

Look where I am.

844
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,684

What's wrong, baby?

847
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,691
I might as well give up
and go back to Fairville.

848
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,487
My friend won't even notice
I'm not at his party.

849
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,030
Oh, I bet he will.

850
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,991
I would notice if Brook or Lane or Wanda
didn't show up to my party.

01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:35,894
I'm obsessed with this cookie tower.

1247
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,063
-Where is the birthday boy?
-Huh.

1248
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,565
What could be keeping him
from the party of the century?

1249
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,320
Where are you, Pee-wee?

1250
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,655
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

1251
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,956
Pee-wee's never gonna make it.

1252
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,332
It's okay, there's still time.

1253
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,334
The party's only been going on
for a couple of hours.

1254
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,961
Nah, I know him.

1255
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:02,921
If he was coming, he'd be here already.

1256
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:07,008
[sighs] Why wouldn't he come?

1257
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,595
Did I do something wrong, Shelly?

1258
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,430
Of course not.

1259
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:16,268
Inviting him to a party cross-country,
I mean, who does that?

1260
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,061
I should've known better.

1261
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:21,148
Stupid Joe.
Stupid, stupid Joe.

1262
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:23,650
[softly] I'm gonna let you
have some space.

1263
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:28,404
[door closes]

1264
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,877
Pee-wee, where are you?

1265
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:47,174
Well, well, well.

1266
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:50,635
I'm trapped in a well.
Halfway to hell.

1267
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,680
I sure hope I don't crack up down here.

1268
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,431
Uh-oh! Too late!

1269
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:56,641
[cackling]

1270
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,694
Mr. Lincoln, what are you doing here?

1271
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,280
I am here to tell you
something very important.

1272
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:12,240
Always eat your vegetables.

1273
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,491
I hate vegetables!

1274
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,659
Eat those Brussels sprouts!

1275
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,161
-[gasps]
-I command you.

1276
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,579
I am the President of the United States.

1277
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:24,711
Your Majesty.

1278
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:26,963
Don't you "Your Majesty" me.

1279
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:30,508
Do you happen to know,
has the hamburger train arrived yet?

1280
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,719
[sighs] Why don't you look
at the schedule?

1281
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,138
-Why don't you?
-[both chuckle]

1282
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:38,892
We suspect that you've stolen
the palace jewels.

1283
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:40,727
Where are they?
Hand them over.

1284
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:44,105
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've never seen those jewels.

1285
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,690
Uh-oh.

1286
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,692
My last match.

1287
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:51,529
[high-pitched screaming]

1288
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,114
Shut up, you little baby!

1289
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:55,283
It doesn't matter
if you make it to the party.

1290
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:58,161
-Joe won't even notice you're not there.
-Yes, he will.

1291
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,496
You're a nobody.
From Nowhere-ville.

1292
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,831
It's Fairville.

1293
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,875
Nobody will notice or care!

1294
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,753
Not Joe, not Fairville...

1295
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,381
Not nobody.
You'll never get out of here.

1296
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:10,965
[cackling]

1297
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:13,634
Help! Help! Help!

1298
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:15,803
-[in distance] Help!
-Hold on...

1299
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,847
-Help!
-Do you hear that?

1300
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,766
[cartoon music playing on TV]

1301
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:24,687
<i>I'm here live in Central Park,</i>

1302

1304
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,278
Now you're in bed?

1305
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:32,862
It's my party, Shelly.

1306
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:34,572
Your guests are asking where you are.

1307
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,367
Some of them have traveled half-way
around the world to be here.

1308
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:41,455
There is only one person that I wanted
to show up to my party and he didn't.

1309
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,916
I know that you're upset about Pee-wee,

1310
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,211
but why don't you come downstairs,
open some presents?

1311
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,464
Venus and Serena are here.

1312
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:52,966
Elton.

1313
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,552
No, I'm just gonna stay here.

1314
01:15:57,471 --> 01:16:00,723
Okay, I'll tell everyone
that you aren't ready yet.

1315
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:11,318
<i>When he was asked if he needed anything,</i>
<i>the boy requested, quote,</i>

<i>A lot of Root Beer Barrels, please."</i>

[whirring]

01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:53,568
May my hand be steady.

Bull's-eye.

1326
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,744
Here I come, Pee-wee!

1327
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,088
Captain Jones.

1328
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:16,299
Good evening.

1329
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:18,593
Joe Manganiello?

1330
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,636
-What are you--
-The boy trapped down the well.

1331
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,263
What's his name?

1332
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:24,516
Well, Mr. Manganiello,
I can't give that information.

1333
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:28,353
Captain... is his name Pee-wee Herman?

1334
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:30,230
Well, yeah.

1335
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,524
Yes, it is.
How'd you know?

1336
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,318
He's my friend.

1337
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:37,945
-Now, what's the plan on getting him out?
-Well...

1338
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:42,325
<i>And we have just received the name</i>
<i>of the boy who fell down the well,</i>

1339

<i>Pee-wee Herman.</i>

1340
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,663
Shut up, everybody!
We know this guy.

1341
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,083
Turn up the volume, Tugboat!

1342
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,127
Pee-wee?

1343
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:54,588
You know Pee-wee?

1344
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:56,964
You know Pee-wee?

1345
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,800
Quiet down, everybody!

1346
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:03,597
Pee-wee's in trouble.

1347
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:05,681
Pee-wee!

1348
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,559
Joe!

1349
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,520
Welcome to New York.

1350
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:12,939
Happy birthday, Joe.

1351
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,524
I fell down a well.

1352
01:18:15,442 --> 01:18:16,443
Yeah, I heard.

1353
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:18,778
How are things going down there?

1354
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:21,864
Great! Really good.
I'll be right up!

1355
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:23,199
-[chuckles]
-Actually, Pee-wee,

1356
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:26,286
I was just informed that,
for safety reasons...

1357
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:30,081
they won't be able to get you
out of this well for another two days.

1358
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,374
Oh...

1359
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,877
So, I guess I'll be...

1360
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,380
Missing my party, yeah.

1361
01:18:37,464 --> 01:18:39,424

1362
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,635
I did everything you said, Joe!

1363
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,095
I broke rules, I broke hearts.

1364
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,346
I lived a little.

1365
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:49,434
I wanted to find out who I was.
Well, I found out, all right!

1366
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:53,813
I'm a stupid little baby
crying at the bottom of this crappy well!

1367

[sobbing]

1368
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,610
Come on, Pee-wee.
You can do it.

1369
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,612
They'll get you out, sport.

1370
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:03,490
You probably didn't even notice
I wasn't at your party!

1371
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:04,949
Are you kidding?

1372
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,828
Pee-wee, can I tell you something?

1373
01:19:11,498 --> 01:19:13,749
Ten minutes ago,
I was bawling my eyes out.

1374
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,627
You were? Why?

1375
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,128
Because...

1376
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,298
I thought you weren't coming to my party.

1377
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,300
[sniffles] Really?

1378
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,135
Mmm-hmm.

1380
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:28,848
I'm getting you out of here, Pee-wee.
Just hang on.

1381
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,183
I'll be right back.

1382
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,434
-Captain...
-Yeah.

1383
01:19:31,518 --> 01:19:34,228
I can't wait two days.
I need Pee-wee out of that well now.

1384
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,605
No, it's too dangerous.

1385
01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:37,315
Gotta make sure the well
doesn't collapse on him.

1386
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:38,650
Collapse on him?

1387
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:40,860
Darn it, Captain, how could
something like this even happen?

1388
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,070
Why wasn't there something
covering the well?

1389
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:45,448
You're right, Mr. Manganiello.
That's the problem.

1390
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:48,368
This metal plate should've
been covering the well.

1391
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:51,954
Metal plate?

1392
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:54,790
Wait...

1393
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:56,917
I've got it.

What party?

Wait, I thought you lived
in the penthouse.

Oh, I do.

1416
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,334
Aren't we going to your party?

01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:22,378
Pee-wee, we are the party.

1418
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:23,546
[elevator bell dings]

1419
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:32,346
[gasps] Holy fudge!

1420
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,683
-A giant miniature world!
-[Joe] Yep!

1421
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:37,852
A giant miniature world.

1422
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:41,230
I made it all myself.
From my imagination.

1423
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:44,400
[Pee-wee] Dinosaur world!

1424
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:47,069
-Cool volcano!
-[Joe] That lava's cotton candy.

1425
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:51,324
Hey, you and I hit it off
the minute we met, remember?

1426
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,075
[chuckles]

1427
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:54,285
You inspired me.

1428
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,665
This is Glitter Mountain. Look!
I covered it with pixies.

1429
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,083
[train horn tooting]

1430
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,003
-[gasps]
-Oh, hey, looky here.

1431
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:08,215
Wow! You even have Fairville!

1432
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:10,677
Dan's Diner.
The town square.

1433
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,595
[gasps] My house!

1434
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:17,933
[gasps] Look, a miniature of my miniature!

1435
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:20,102
I knew you'd notice that. [chuckles]

1436
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:22,563
And... the best part.

1437
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:25,608
[gasps]

1438
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:36,828
My tree house!

1439
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:42,249
Look, Joe.

1440
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,502
I made this present for you.

1441
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:48,339
Happy birthday.

1442
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:50,633
A friendship bracelet.

1443
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:51,843
Right.

1444
01:22:58,558 --> 01:22:59,684
And look.

1445
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,353
[chuckles] It's just like mine!

1446
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,438
-Yeah!
-[both laughing]

1447
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,903
-You know what would make this perfect?
-Yep.

1448
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,118
Boop!

1449
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:20,287
Boop!

1450
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,584
-[both] To friendship.
-[clinks]

1451
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,425
[both] Ah!

[both laughing]

1453
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:49,776
Here you go, fellas.

1454
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:51,527
-Thanks, Bev. Yum!
-Thanks, Bev.

1455
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,113
What's this stuff on my plate?

1456
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,907
Look, it's on my plate, too.

1457
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:58,952
Let's ask the chef.
Hey, Pee-wee!

1458
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,202
Yes, Beverly?

1459
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:02,872
What is this on these gentlemen's plates?

1460
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:04,999
-Fish sticks.
-No, there.

1461
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,042
-Oh. You mean the garnish.
-Garnish?

1462
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:09,128
Yes, garnish.

1463
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:14,008
A decoration or embellishment
of a prepared food-plate or drink

1464
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,260
to augment the visual impact on the plate.

1465
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:17,386
Can you eat it?

1466
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,138
My garnish tastes like an orange.

1467
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,306
It is an orange.

1468
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,057
[Beverly] Yes, your meal
will come with garnish.

1469
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:23,434
Welcome back, Pee-wee!

1470
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,312
I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something different about you.

1471
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,522
[Emily] He's worldly now.
Right, Pee-wee?

1472
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:29,983
[Renegades] Pee-wee!

1473
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,693
Pee-wee, why don't you stop by
and jam with us tonight?

1474
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:34,487
Why don't you?

1475
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,823
-This adding machine... hmm?
-Dan, check this out.

1476
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:38,866
Solar-powered calculator.

1477
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:39,951
Solar?

1478
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:41,911
Yep, from the Latin, <i>solaris,</i>

1479
01:24:41,995 --> 01:24:45,498
meaning, "Derives its power
from the sun or <i>sol."</i>

1480
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,582
Hmm?

1481
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,044
[chuckles] It works!

1482
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:53,006
And this thing is just the size
of a business card!

1483
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,548
Ain't that a miracle?

1484
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:55,591
[chuckles]

1485
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:04,350
[motorcycle engine revving]

1486
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:28,875
[Pee-wee exclaims]

1487
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,669
[Pee-wee laughs]

1488
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:35,756
