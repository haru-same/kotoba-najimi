1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,435
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers picked to live in a house

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,228
and have their lives taped.

4
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,481
All that has been prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,318
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,905
-Let's see. A lot happened last time.
-What happened?

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:34,618
The night before Naomi left for Japan...

8
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,953
There was a great line.

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,540
-That's right! By the pool.
-Yes, by the pool.

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,584
What do you mean by "positive"?

11
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,294
In terms of both my work and my love life.

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,672
I actually already made a move.

13
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,965
Really?

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,800
That's why Yusuke's not here.

15
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,303
I told him I wanted to talk to you alone
before I left.

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,808
From Naomi's perspective,
she and Yuya were becoming closer.

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,603
His behavior made her think so.

18
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,521
He was wearing her earring.

19
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,609
And that night, he made parfaits with her.

20
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,694
-He lent her his jacket.
-He did.

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,989
-But for now, he's brushing it aside.
-Yeah.

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,075
-Yuya and Avian...
-That's right.

23
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,702
-He wants Avian, right?
-Yes.

24
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,786
He said he did.

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,413
-Are you interested in anyone?
-Right now?

26
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,084
You are?

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,673
The time right before something starts
is the best.

28
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,549
-If something's starting.
-It's exciting.

29
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,012
-That "hmm" was the top of its class.
-A top-class hmm?

30
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,805
It's decided then?

31
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,557
-Yes, a top-class hmm.
-It was very progressive.

32
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,936
-And Lauren and Eric...
-This is the problem!

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,980
But they're not...

34
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:49,317
-We don't know what will come of it.
-They just went shopping.

35
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,654
But later, Eric and Lauren...

36
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,240
-Eric asks Lauren to help with his wall.
-Yes.

37
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,700
He's coming on strong.

38
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,245
-And Yusuke sees that and sort of...
-Yes.

39
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,955
He walks away.

40
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,874
-He held back a little.
-Yeah.

41
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,710
We were going to just paint it at first...

42
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,047
So that's where I want your help.

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,131
Of course!

44
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,763
He should've invited Yusuke
to take a look, too.

45
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,222
-Right!
-That wasn't cool.

46
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:24,144
I mean, he knows Yusuke
is interested in Lauren.

47
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,104
-He knows that.
-Right.

48
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:31,026
Maybe working with Lauren
has nothing to do with Yusuke.

49
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,404
Maybe he's simply thinking,
"Lauren's a little fox."

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,449
You're an idiot.

51
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,994
[impersonating Eric]
"Lauren's such a little fox."

52
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,664
-That sounds like him!
-Exactly like him.

53
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,083
Remember we talked about
me asking Lauren out?

54
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,251
I haven't gotten, like...

55
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,837
my head in the right place.

56
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:55,092
I recently found out
how amazing Yusuke really is.

57
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,928
-How's that?
-I keep mentioning him...

58
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,807
but Eiichiro Oda sent me
his thoughts again.

59
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,268
He sends me a message
every time Terrace House airs.

60
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,773
He said, "Yama-chan, are you sure it's
okay to make fun of Yusuke?"

61
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,944
And he sent me a video of Yusuke.
I forwarded it to all of you.

62
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,780
-Yes, you did.
-Eiichiro Oda messaged me...

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,240
"He's so amazing.

64
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,077
How can you make fun
of his virginity, Yama-chan?"

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,412
-He is really amazing.
-Is he that good?

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,998
He's amazing.

67
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,793
It made me want to send him a tweet.

68
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,713
-To Yusuke?
-You?

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,883
I decided not to, though.
I'm a professional after all.

70
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,593
Of course not!
How could you even consider it!?

71
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,388
Stop trying to suck up to 18-year olds.

72
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,557
I said I decided not to!
I stopped myself.

73
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,809
Watch out, Ken-chan.

74
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,897
Your popularity's taking off
like a rocket right now,

75
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,607
so Yama-chan might
try to hop on for the ride.

76
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,486
If you make one more good movie,
I'll really start kissing your butt.

77
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,448
If it goes that far, it's almost cool.

78
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,910
That's true, that's true.

79
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,597
Did anything happen while I was away?

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,474
Just my date with Avian.

81
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,268
That's all that happened around here.

82
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,146
Can I ask about it?

83
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,941
You should ask Avian first.

84
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,027
That would definitely be better.

85
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,365
-Here, eat this, Yusuke.
-You're right.

86
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,368
-Bon appétit.
-What do you want to do tomorrow, Naomi?

87
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,079
-I want to go shopping.
-Shopping?

88
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,831
-For stuff for the house.
-Groceries?

89
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,165
-That and...
-Have fun.

90
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,377
Huh? You're coming, too.
Come on, let's go together.

91
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,923
-It'll be too heavy to carry.
-I might have to go to school.

92
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,883
Did you get up on time all week?

93
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,302
-Were you late at all?
-Hm?

94
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,639
Were you late?

95
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,932
You really want to know?

96
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,143
This week? Yeah, I was late.

97
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,644
How many times?

98
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:54,980
Twice.

99
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,648
No one woke you up?

100
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,153
Eric told me your alarm kept going off.

101
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,862
For, like, 30 minutes.

102
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,493
-What did you do in Japan?
-I shopped.

103
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,371
I bought some cute pajamas.

104
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,123
-Oh, yeah?
-Nice ones.

105
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,166
I'll show you sometime.

106
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,377
Do you usually wear pajamas?

107
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,170
No.

108
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,882
-You don't?
-Not usually.

109
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,676
Why'd you buy some if you
don't usually wear them?

110
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,469
-Because it's cute, right?
-Yeah.

111
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,639
-Would you want a girl to wear pajamas?
-Would I?

112
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,143
It's okay for me to wear them,
but I wouldn't want my partner to.

113
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,520
-You know?
-That's weird.

114
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,106
Well, maybe it's weird
for me to say this...

115
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,277
but pajamas just seem so stiff.
Don't they? No? What am I saying?

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,406
Wearing pajamas makes someone seem
more open, doesn't it?

117
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,116
The most open is being naked.

118
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,870
-That's a given.
-Don't say that with a straight face.

119
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,580
Do you sleep naked, Lauren?

120
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,542
There are three of us, so, no.

121
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,295
-I sleep like this.
-You should just sleep naked.

122
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,924
Lauren is never naked in the room.

123
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,636
Yeah, only in the shower.

124
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,180
-Only in the bath.
-Yeah.

125
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,266
-But Naomi's naked all the time.
-Yeah, I am.

126
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,894
I walk around the bedroom naked.

127
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,062
You do?

128
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,023
-Not much I can say about that.
-Yeah, right?

129
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,776
-You do, huh?
-Maybe that was too much information.

130
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,867
How was your date with Yuya?

131
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,078
The date, yeah...

132
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,872
It was, like...

133
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,295
It was different than usual.
You know, when we all go surfing together?

134
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,047
I felt nervous this time.

135
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,757
-Nervous?
-Really nervous.

136
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,677
Because it was a date this time?

137
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,303
Yeah...

138
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,391
-What do you think of Yuya?
-I really had fun that day.

139
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,101
-Really?
-The date was fun.

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,729
Terrace House just started airing,

141
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,898
so I watched the first episode.

142
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,401
-You saw it?
-Yeah, I told you. Did you?

143
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,069
-Not yet.
-Oh, really?

144
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,989
I haven't seen it,
so I don't know what's going on.

145
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,158
On the first night...

146
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:17,122
the guys were talking in their room
about who they were interested in.

147
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:23,545
And Yuya said he gets along with you best.

148
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,380
That he was interested in you.

149
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,008
-He said that!?
-He did. On the first day.

150
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,513
That's really embarrassing.

151
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,889
-Embarrassing?
-Yeah.

152
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,601
-I suppose so.
-He doesn't act that way at all at home.

153
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,688
Even though we're living together,

154
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,024
he doesn't really talk to me.

155
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,568
Yeah.

156
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,987
-He's always on his phone.
-Or listening to music.

157
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,322
Yeah, or watching Netflix.

158
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,245
-What about Eric?
-I think he's a good person.

159
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,125
The first couple of weeks,

160
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,253
I didn't get along great with him.

161
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,255
But now I really like his personality.

162
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,592
What if he asks you out on a date?
Would you go?

163
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,801
Well...

164
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,682
I might get all anxious like that.

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,090
I finally get to see it.

173
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,719
-Where I work has been a mystery, right?
-Yeah.

174
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,140
So, have you come up with any good ideas?

175
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:44,436
It might be hard to see
with a design like this.

176
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,064
-You mean the letters?
-Yes, it might be hard to see the letters.

177
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,774
But I want to draw it...

178
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,404
so that the letters pop.

179
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,988
And the colors?

180
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,576
It'll be something like this,
but with different colors.

181
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,118
-The colors--
-Nice.

182
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,787
-Nice?
-Nice.

183
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,080
These four.

184
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,842
If you finish that...

185
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,595
I'll bring it home after it dries.

186
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,724
Okay, then I'll paint it at home.

187
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,731
We're all so quiet.

188
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,566
Sorry.

189
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,193
Why?

190
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,236
We're starting to build on Tuesday.

191
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,574
-You're starting already?
-Yeah.

192
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
-Those are the colors?
-The Punch Bowl?

193
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,205
-Are you adding more colors?
-No, this is about it.

194
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,000
-Show me the bottom.
-I'm gonna get ready for school tomorrow.

195
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,627
Okay.

196
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,920
Good luck, Eric.

197
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,257
-Thank you!
-Like this?

198
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,634
I'm making everything.

199
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,554
I'm going downstairs.

200
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,765
Okay.
To do work?

201
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,184
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

202
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,277
I'm gonna head downstairs
for a chat with...someone.

203
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,194
With who?

204
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,487
Who knows?

205
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,615
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Who knows?

206
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,955
-I'm going downstairs, too.
-Okay.

207
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,957
-Good luck.
-Thanks, thanks.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,842
Mysterious Avian.

209
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,346
-Right?
-Mysterious?

210
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,848
Why do you think so?

211
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,642
Because I can't guess anything.

212
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,937
-Really?
-About what you're like in a relationship.

213
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,606
Are you the type to
pamper or be pampered?

214
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,776
I like to be pampered, like any girl.

215
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,571
How? Like getting more attention?

216
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,074
What about you?
You like to be pampered alot, right?

217
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,369
-Yeah, I'm that type.
-That's what I thought.

218
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,121
You're the type that can't be alone.

219
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,709
-Yeah, not really.
-Right?

220
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,003
-Seems that way.
-I need someone to talk to.

221
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,755
That's why you're always talking to Naomi.

222
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,512
She's always willing
to accommodate me.

223
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,433
-Accommodate you?
-I mean she responds to what I say.

224
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,936
Lauren doesn't respond to you?

225
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,564
Yeah, you and Lauren always ignore me.

226
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,942
I don't ignore you.

227
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,445
You never talk to me.

228
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,196
Yes I do!

229
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,700
Recently, I think we were talking
on the sofa,

230
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,410
but you ran off to the rec room.

231
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,539
-Got any plans tomorrow?
-No.

232
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,457
That's perfect.

233
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,752
Want to go somewhere?
Maybe a café?

234
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,630
-We can get something to eat.
-Sure. Let's go.

235
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,840
We can go whenever.

236
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,969
I'll wake you when I get up.

237
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,262
Don't stare like that.

238
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,102
-Stop. Seriously.
-Why are you embarrassed?

239
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,062
I'm not embarrassed.

240
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,035
-Want to split this? It would be perfect.
-Sure.

241
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,329
We can split this
and get two cups of coffee.

242
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,415
Sure.

243
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,459
Do you get asked out by guys often?

244
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,878
It seems like it.

245
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,713
They do.

246
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,550
They do, but...

247
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,635
Do you go out a lot?

248
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,595
No.

249
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,055
You turn them down?

250
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,475
I don't want to be misleading.

251
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,064
And you?
Would you go if you were asked out?

252
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,983
If I was asked, then I would go.

253
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,947
It's not something I try to be, but...

254
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,199
I've been told by a lot of people

255
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,493
that I can be really misleading.

256
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,745
People always tell me that.

257
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,831
I can see that.

258
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,417
No way, really? Do I do that?

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,168
Well...

260
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,256
-With Naomi, yeah.
-No way!

261
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,259
Seriously?

262
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:32,474
For example, when Naomi says she's cold...

263
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,059
you'll lend her your jacket.

264
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,395
-That sort of thing.
-That's what you mean?

265
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,191
-That's not my intention at all.
-People don't usually just lend jackets.

266
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,861
You do it someone's cold, right?

267
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,904
I do it all the time.

268
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,909
You do? To just friends?
I don't do that.

269
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,412
-Why not? They're cold.
-I don't think I would.

270
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,707
-Really?
-Well, it's because you're nice.

271
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,419
I'm not conscious of that
when I'm doing it or anything.

272
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:06,423
I think there's a limit
to how nice you should be.

273
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,806
There's a love triangle,
and Yuya's in the middle.

274
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,810
Even while she's telling Yuya
he shouldn't do something...

275
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:24,275
Avian's feelings toward
the sweetness of this younger guy is...

276
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,403
It's like it might overtake her.

277
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,532
They were flirting a little bit, right?

278
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,075
-When they were cutting shirts together.
-Yeah.

279
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,745
But on the other side of the wall,
Naomi's like...

280
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,875
-And the way the phone lit her face...
-Yes.

281
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,459
-It was lit up.
-Kind of blue.

282
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,004
She was really focused on her phone.

283
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,715
-Maybe she was googling poisons.
-Could be.

284
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,466
-"Poison. Untraceable."
-Exactly.

285
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,636
-"Easy to grow."
-Stop it!

286
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,764
She's not like that!

287
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,060
And what was with that
ridiculous pajama theory Yusuke had?

288
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,478
"Pajamas seem stiff."

289
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,817
-It was so cute!
-After Lauren mentioned being naked,

290
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,571
-Yusuke became quiet and did this.
-Stop that.

291
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,739
Tokui said the table was about to rise.

292
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:15,535
-A little bit, right above Yusuke's lap.
-Like in the comics.

293
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,537
Like a Japanese porno comic.

294
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,873
But Naomi also says she bought pajamas.

295
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,961
And that she'll show them off sometime.

296
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,505
And Yuya asks all insensitively,
"Why'd you buy them?"

297
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,467
"Do you usually wear them?"
"No."

298
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,345
-"Then why'd you buy them?"
-He did say it like that.

299
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,765
Yusuke jumps in to say,
"It's because they're cute, right?"

300
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,516
That was nice of him.

301
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,229
-It was sweet.
-It was so sweet.

302
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,898
-Yuya's so insensitive.
-He is.

303
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,692
He's seriously insensitive.

304
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,987
You always know one person like that.

305
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,865
An older woman like Avian
might find that cute.

306
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,492
That kids are like this.

307
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,496
That's fine if she thinks it's cute.
But if she sees him as a kid,

308
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,332
-then she won't see him as a man.
-That's true.

309
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,920
There was a younger guy that really
liked Seina, remember?

310
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,923
With hair like a shih tzu.
What was his name?

311
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,717
-Daiki!
-Daiki.

312
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,012
He has to love Avian at that level.

313
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,057
Otherwise, she won't think it's cute.

314
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,645
Avian is calmer than Seina.

315
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,062
She's saner.

316
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,440
It'd be interesting if Seina showed up.

317
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,028
-What would happen if she did?
-That would be really interesting.

318
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,197
-She'd be so high-energy in Hawaii.
-Right?

319
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,660
Maybe we can have a separate shoot
with Seina in Hawaii.

320
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,663
-I want to see that.
-There'd be so many great lines!

321
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,575
Nice work!

322
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,079
You were so cool.

323
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,622
Really? Thank you.

324
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,959
I was so worried.

325
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,127
You were first!

326
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,129
-I was like, "Oh, it's Lauren!"
-Yeah.

327
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,756
It was a last-minute change.

328
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,841
I was third,
but then all of a sudden

329
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,094
They were just like,
"Put on this bathing suit. Go!"

330
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:06,849
-So you weren't meant to go first?
-Yeah, I was supposed to be third.

331
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,226
But thank you so much for coming.

332
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,688
-It was fun.
-Yeah, it was amazing.

333
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,648
Are you heading home now?

334
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,109
-I have work.
-I'll probably head home.

335
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,488
-Then I'll see you in the evening.
-Let's talk then.

336
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,157
-Let's talk then.
-Good job.

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,575
Thank you so much.

338
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,551
I'm going to take a bath and go to sleep.

339
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,761
-Right, you've got tomorrow.
-Good job.

340
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,722
Good luck. I'll come tomorrow.

341
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,101
Good night.

342
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,311
-Good work.
-Good night.

343
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,363
What's that?

344
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,949
-Someone's knocking.
-Someone's here.

345
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,658
Who is it?

346
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,160
There it is again!

347
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,996
-Hello.
-Good evening.

348
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,372
Nice to meet you.

349
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,623
Nice to meet you.

350
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,251
Aloha! Mahola!

351
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,378
That means "thank you."

352
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,631
-I'm Daiki. Nice to meet you.
-I'm Eric. Nice to meet you.

353
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,425
-I'm Seina. Nice to meet you!
-I'm Yuya.

354
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,136
Sorry for the intrusion.

355
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,096
Wow, amazing!

356
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

357
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,391
It's nice to meet you.

358
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:31,976
Let's drink.

359
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,520
-You're in Hawaii?
-Yes, I'm visiting Hawaii.

360
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,897
SEINA SHIMABUKURO, MODEL

361
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,981
I arrived yesterday.

362
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,526
I've been in Maui for about two months.
She came yesterday.

363
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,236
DAIKI ITOH, WINDSURFER

364
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,071
We met up and came to Oahu.

365
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,698
-Where should I sit?
-Anywhere.

366
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,827
-Really? I want to sit there.
-It's free.

367
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,371
Please, go ahead.

368
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,873
-I want to sit here.
-Let me get a glass.

369
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,627
This has the best camera angle.

370
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,382
-Is that so?
-Seina, did you used to be on...

371
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,843
-Were you on the show?
-Yeah, I was one of the first members.

372
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:10,932
-I'm pretty much a legend.
-I knew I heard your name before.

373
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,766
I'm a pretty big legend.

374
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,643
-Wow.
-I recognized your name.

375
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,727
Let's toast.

376
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,315
-Cheers.
-Thanks for having us!

377
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,818
This is great. I'm so happy!

378
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,862
I never thought they'd set
Terrace House in Hawaii.

379
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,281
Insane, isn't it?

380
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,701
-Wasn't there another surfer?
-There was.

381
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,578
What was his name?

382
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,830
-Masato Yukawa.
-Oh, Masato.

383
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,915
I was mixing you two up.

384
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,375
-That's not me.
-Right.

385
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,918
I'm the long-haired one.

386
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,713
-The one with the long hair.
-Yes, yes.

387
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:47,093
And there was a party
where you got drunk and...

388
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,054
-kissed in the rec room.
-That was her.

389
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,139
Yeah, that was me and another guy.

390
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,891
-Oh, I see.
-Yeah.

391
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,858
But we're here now
because all of that happened.

392
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,985
Yeah.

393
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,238
-What do you do, Daiki?
-I windsurf and...

394
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,740
I've been traveling overseas
for the World Cup.

395
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,952
Going to different places,
like Spain, now Maui.

396
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,123
I stay in Maui every year
for about three months.

397
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,124
Amazing.

398
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,458
But she gets mad.

399
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,044
-Why?
-She wants me to come home.

400
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,171
-I do go home.
-It's a long distance relationship.

401
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,883
But it's been a pretty long time now.

402
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,969
Around two and a half years?

403
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,223
-That is long.
-Yeah, and we met on Terrace House.

404
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,725
So there's hope for you.

405
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,643
Yeah, there is.

406
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,521
-Yeah, just go for it.
-There's hope.

407
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,234
So is there anything going on,
romantically?

408
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,112
-Romantically?
-Not really. Here and there...

409
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,571
Are you in love?

410
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,572
-I'm...
-Are you?

411
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,116
-Are you?
-Not at all.

412
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,033
Well...

413
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,536
-Why are you being vague?
-You are, for sure.

414
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,746
I'm focused on work right now.

415
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,791
You're focused on work?
You're already 27, right?

416
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,252
-Am I getting old?
-Yeah, you better hurry.

417
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,299
What was it like
when you first started going out?

418
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:13,137
He's six years younger than me,
but he kept asking me out on dates.

419
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,557
Yeah, it's just harder
for girls to ask the guys out.

420
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,517
So if you're interested in someone,

421
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,728
you should just ask them out on a date.

422
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,480
-You're right.
-Yeah.

423
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:27,568
Everyone hanging out together is different
from two people hanging out alone.

424
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,695
Yeah, it really is.

425
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,030
-Have you had a girlfriend before?
-Never.

426
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,325
-You've never dated anyone?
-Not even once.

427
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,203
-Seriously?
-So you've never been with a girl before?

428
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,246
-Well, yeah.
-Excuse me.

429
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,707
-You've never kissed a girl?
-Never.

430
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,419
That's amazing.
You have so much to look forward to.

431
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,800
Looks like Avian never came back home.

432
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,677
-She's late.
-I can't reach her.

433
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,262
-What?
-She's super late.

434
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,806
-If she's coming, we'd like to meet her.
-Yeah.

435
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,267
-But it is late.
-She's not coming?

436
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,854
-We should get going.
-Maybe she's out seeing another guy.

437
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,772
No way!

438
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,732
No, she's working.

439
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,775
Oh, is she?

440
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,401
I'm just joking.

441
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,821
Even if she is, it doesn't matter.

442
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,324
"It doesn't matter"? Oh, wow!

443
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,910
He's making you look bad.

444
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,872
Pretty bad, no?
"It really doesn't matter."

445
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,667
Wow, I didn't think I'd hear that
from an 18-year-old.

446
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:30,631
If you just show what makes you appealing,
they'll come to you on their own.

447
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,509
-Well, yeah, that's true.
-Right?

448
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,219
You're right, it doesn't matter.

449
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,554
-It doesn't matter.
-It totally doesn't.

450
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,390
It doesn't matter
if she's out dating or whatever else.

451
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,975
-That's right.
-Yeah.

452
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,479
Well, that was fun and I got to say
what I wanted. Time to go home!

453
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,397
-You're leaving already?
-Yup.

454
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,234
It was fun. I'm glad you came.

455
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,736
-Thank you.
-I'm glad we got to meet.

456
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,696
-See you! Hug me, hug me!
-Thank you.

457
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,659
-Hug me, see you later!
Thanks for coming.

458
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,076
Thank you! Hug me!

459
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,579
-Thank you.
-You can do it!

460
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,623
-Come again.
-We will!

461
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,917
Thanks for having us! It was a lot of fun!

462
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,044
Thank you! Sorry to bother you!

463
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,422
-Good night! See you!
-Good night.

464
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,799
-See you.
-Thank you!

465
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,552
Man, she's a vibrant one.

466
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,555
-Amazing.
-She's got a lot of energy.

467
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,723
[impersonating Seina]
"See you! See you!"

468
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,850
-It was crazy.
-It was nice.

469
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,019
-That was surprising.
-That was fun.

470
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,235
It's hot.

471
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,196
-Too hot.
-Right?

472
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,448
Can I turn on the air conditioner?

473
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,284
Are you just getting ready
for your test today?

474
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,411
Yeah, all I have to do today is study.

475
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,497
-Nice. Good luck.
-Thank you.

476
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,668
But the test seems like
it'll be pretty easy this time.

477
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,380
-Really?
-Yeah. Last time it was about names.

478
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,883
But this time it's about
what I like on the menu.

479
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:01,138
I haven't tried anything yet,
so I'm just imagining it as I go.

480
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,559
-You have to ask about allergies, too.
-Yeah, stuff like that.

481
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,519
-Like, what's in it.
-Good morning.

482
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,437
Good morning.

483
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:17,529
Is it okay if I talk to Lauren alone?

484
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,659
I was just thinking of leaving.

485
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,202
I'll show myself out, then!

486
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,371
-Let me get up.
-Take your time!

487
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,296
Ah, don't worry about that.

488
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,592
You don't have to be so formal.

489
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,765
Are you already done
with that modeling job?

490
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,267
Yup, it's all over.

491
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,145
Are you free at all next week, then?

492
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,605
Next week...

493
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,941
Yeah, I'm pretty free.

494
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,943
Are you free on the 18th or the 20th?

495
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,653
The 18th...

496
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,404
Okay.

497
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,531
Let me take a look.

498
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:05,536
I think it's a Friday and a Sunday.
Either day is fine.

499
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:06,828
Yeah, I'm free.

500
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,747
-Wanna go somewhere?
-Which day?

501
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,874
Um... whichever.

502
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,543
Either day works?

503
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,836
Want to go see a movie together?

504
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,048
Is there anything you want to see?

505
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,966
Hmmm, what's playing now?

506
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,346
You said before you like animated movies.

507
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,222
Is there something like that out?

508
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,684
I'm sure there is. There must be.

509
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,352
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

510
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,770
Something must be playing.

511
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,899
Any time is okay with me.

512
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,734
-Any time?
-Whenever works for you.

513
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,239
I'll check my schedule

514
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,200
and get back to you later.

515
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,244
Okay, thanks.

516
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,453
Don't thank me!

517
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,747
I'm sure it'll be fun.

518
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,626
I'm going to get ready for the gym.

519
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,338
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

520
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,632
Alright.

521
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,768
Hey.

522
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,483
-What are you doing?
-Playing a game. Killing time.

523
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,903
You asked her?

524
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,905
Yeah.

525
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:24,906
How'd it go?

526
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:27,993
It went.

527
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,913
It went?
You mean you're gonna go out together?

528
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,206
Yeah.

529
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,960
That's great. What did you say?

530
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,006
-What did you say?
-Well... I...

531
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,428
I asked her if she was free
on the 18th or the 20th.

532
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:50,932
And if she'd want to see a movie
if she's free.

533
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,604
-I was so nervous.
-And?

534
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,774
She said she'll check her schedule,
but she's probably free.

535
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,109
-Like, "Sure."
-Nice.

536
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,652
A movie date, huh?

537
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,616
-It's a date, right?
-I'm sure she doesn't think it is.

538
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,118
-But for me...
-It's a date?

539
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,036
Yeah, it is.

540
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,080
A movie alone with a girl...

541
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,165
Your first time?

542
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,709
-Of course.
-Oh, yeah.

543
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,252
That's great.

544
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,505
-Makes your heart race, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

545
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,384
Wow, this is insane.

546
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,844
-You're happy?
-I'm happy.

547
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,972
He's so cute!

548
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,559
This is going to affect his music.
Is that okay?

549
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,144
-He's so cute!
-I'm happy for him.

550
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,228
Nice!

551
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,231
-It was so surprising!
-We predicted it.

552
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,317
-We must be prophets.
-Yes!

553
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,403
I yelled so loud, I'm embarrassed.

554
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,822
You really did.

555
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,573
Wait!

556
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,366
Isn't that Seina and Daiki?

557
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,411
-No way!
-It's Seina!

558
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,623
She has descended! Seina has descended!

559
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,335
-I was thirsting for Seina.
-Seriously.

560
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,756
There was the famous "hug me."

561
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,051
"Bye! Thank you! Thank you! Bye!"

562
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,303
"I'll come again!"

563
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,098
It was past midnight. How terrible!

564
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,851
-But it was great.
-Thanks to Seina...

565
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,687
Is it? Is it really thanks to Seina?

566
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,231
-Yeah.
-She pushed him to do it.

567
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:25,235
-There needed to be that kind of...
-Power.

568
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:29,448
Thanks for setting things
in motion, Seina.

569
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,783
-As expected. She makes things happen.
-She does.

570
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:35,328
-She can make things happen.
-She really can.

571
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,082
But I think I'm full now,
so I don't need her again for a while.

572
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,628
-But she made him ask her out!
-He did.

573
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,506
The way he said
she probably doesn't think it’s a date...

574
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,173
That was nice.

575
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,259
-He made an effort.
-He did it.

576
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,220
He was nervous and talking quicker.

577
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,723
He drank so much water. It was so cute!

578
00:32:54,806 --> 00:33:00,729
And offering two dates as options...
He definitely thought hard about that.

579
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,484
And he asked what movie she wants to see.
Like, "What's playing now?"

580
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,655
But I'm sure he has it all researched.

581
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:14,367
And he said, "You said you're interested
in so-and-so, right?"

582
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,620
I'm sure he researched that genre.

583
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,873
-That was so surprising.
-It was amazing.

584
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,668
-For everyone watching...
-This was really a treat.

585
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,673
Yusuke asked you to a movie?

586
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,550
Yeah, and I said I'd go.

587
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,512
-You did?
-But at the time,

588
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:37,098
and this might be a cultural difference,

589
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:42,813
but if a guy friend asks you to a movie,
it's normal to go as friends.

590
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,230
-To go as friends?
-Yeah.

591
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,524
That's normal here.

592
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,194
It's not a date unless you say it is.

593
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,989
But thinking about it now...

594
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,117
I'm sure he thinks it's a date.

595
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,620
-Yusuke?
-Yeah, Yusuke.

596
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,623
-You haven't talked about that?
-No, not yet.

597
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:07,379
He didn't say it was a date,
but he was really nervous.

598
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,381
I can just picture it.

599
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,925
Like, "Lauren..."

600
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,636
I don't know what Yusuke's thinking.

601
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,015
-If he thinks it's a date...
-He likes you.

602
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,560
I don't know. I...

603
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,062
-He does.
-I don't know that at all.

604
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,397
Yusuke probably...

605
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:29,776
Well, he talked a little bit about it
to me before.

606
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,155
He said he wants to get to know you.

607
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,326
Because he doesn't really know you

608
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,913
since he hasn't really gotten
to talk to you.

609
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,624
He told me that.

610
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,793
I was just wondering,

611
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,589
what should I do?

612
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:55,426
And I didn't say anything.
But right now, I feel...

613
00:34:56,386 --> 00:35:01,349
I'm sure you know,
but I don't feel that way towards Yusuke.

614
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,561
You don't know what to do?

615
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:08,815
-I think it's fine to go.
-Me, too.

616
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:13,779
I should give him a chance.
I should go and have fun.

617
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,698
If something changes, then it changes.

618
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,243
And if it doesn't, then nothing changes.

619
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,622
If you go and you have fun...

620
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,874
then you're okay with that?

621
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:31,838
If nothing romantic happens,
then that's fine with me.

622
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,424
You don't want that, right?

623
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,218
-Yeah, not right now.
-You don't, right?

624
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,263
Right now, I don't feel that way.

625
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:46,602
I think that's okay.
You should try going.

626
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,520
I will.

627
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,774
And later...

628
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,611
if you don't have feelings for him,
you can just tell him.

629
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,322
Yeah, it's just the timing.

630
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,450
I think if you're clear about it,
Yusuke would understand.

631
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,788
Yeah, Yusuke would definitely understand.
