1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,847
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:18,268
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers picked to live in a house

3
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,062
and have their lives taped.

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,566
All that has been prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,276
There is no script at all.

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,155
Last time,
they all went to the North Shore together.

7
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,617
-Enjoying the days of their youth.
-It was beautiful.

8
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:38,496
Yusuke tried to talk with Lauren...

9
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:39,623
but he couldn't.

10
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,042
-Yeah, he was overthinking it.
-That's right.

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,255
I couldn't find the right timing.
I know I shouldn't worry about that.

12
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,173
-But you do?
-Yeah, I can't help it.

13
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,467
I don't think I have the confidence yet.

14
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,761
Then came
the infamous Terrace House issue.

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,223
-Yes, the cleaning Incident.
-You sound like a cartoon character.

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,062
And like, the towels, for example...

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,608
Sometimes there's a bunch of used towels
that aren't hung back up.

18
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,652
They're all wet
and lying all over the place.

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,363
And you think that's me?

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,784
And after
those nasty attacks from both sides

21
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,828
Naomi sought out advice from Yuya.

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,957
And Yuya just kept saying
one good thing after another.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,794
And then Lauren just told me that...

24
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:31,424
she felt like we were saying she
was in the wrong and we were accusing her.

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,218
You have to just speak up.

26
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,846
Otherwise, it might be taken
the wrong way.

27
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,098
But thank you
for wording things so gently.

28
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,144
She's thinking,
"Oh, Yuya's saying such great things."

29
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,561
She's feel grateful.

30
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:48,942
We even found out
that Yuya was wearing Naomi's earring.

31
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,029
-And despite all that...
-That's when it happened.

32
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,113
Right in front of her.

33
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,240
I wanted to talk to Avian.

34
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,117
-Avian? Oh, should I...
-No, stay.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,787
-You sure?
-It's fine. Are you free Sunday?

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,413
In the morning.

37
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,833
Let's go surfing in the morning
and then grab some food.

38
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,419
Just the two of us.

39
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,754
Just the two of us?

40
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,423
Sure.

41
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,051
-That's all.
-Alright, let's go.

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,139
Naomi was the only one who felt like
she and Yuya had gotten a little closer.

43
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,225
-"It's okay. You can stay."
-Yeah, that was rough.

44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,394
It's like, "You're just an extra."

45
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,646
He didn't say that!

46
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,523
-No one said "extra."
-That's horrible.

47
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,193
-Just horrible.
-Things are happening romantically.

48
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,030
And how close will Yusuke be able to get
to Lauren this week?

49
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,668
-We didn't finish our project yet.
-Oh, really?

50
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,089
That's what you get for
drinking yesterday.

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,465
I'm gonna get in trouble.

52
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,760
-Can you still go to the farmers' market?
-Yup.

53
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,721
You sure?
You don't have to if you're busy.

54
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,639
-It's no problem.
-Really?

55
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,976
I've never gone this early before.

56
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,310
Never?

57
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,145
What do you want to get?

58
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,231
Ummm...
Some fruit, yeah?

59
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,108
-Exotic fruit?
-Exotic fruit.

60
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,069
And some vegetables,
if there's some cheap ones.

61
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,529
Maybe some good coffee, too,
if they have any.

62
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,240
-Yeah.
-Coffee beans.

63
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,449
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

64
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,003
There's a line.

65
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,173
-There's a crowd, as usual.
-Yeah, as usual.

66
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,011
-Let's look at everything and then decide.
-Sounds good.

67
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,389
-Those daikon look really good.
-Yeah, this one.

68
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,307
-Can't go wrong.
-How much is it?

69
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,394
-For a daikon salad.
-Oh, yeah, let's make that!

70
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,896
These look good, too.

71
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,732
-Wooow!
-Nice.

72
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,199
-These look good, too.
-What is it?

73
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,410
-It's like jam.
-Ahhh.

74
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,189
Hold on, I'm gonna take a picture.

75
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,496
I feel like i'm on a survival show.

76
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,208
Want this, too? Here.

77
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,753
So, have you gotten used to things?

78
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,967
The first week was a little tough.
Everyone was always home.

79
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,262
-But I like being alone.
-Ahhh.

80
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,181
I like hanging out with everyone...

81
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,352
but I need some alone time, too.

82
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,478
I hear you.

83
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,522
Everyone was worried for a while.

84
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,274
-Like, "is Lauren okay?"
-I know.

85
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,234
I was surprised to hear that.

86
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,281
We bought a lot of vegetables.

87
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,869
I couldn't find any fruits I liked.

88
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,497
I just bought a few bananas.

89
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,625
-Wanna head home?
-Yeah, let's go.

90
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,547
Where'd we park?
Ah, over there.

91
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,717
-The farmers' market was fun.
-Right?

92
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,469
I'd come again, 
but I got too much sun.

93
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,722
-You're definitely getting darker.
-I know.

94
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,515
-So?
-It stresses me out.

95
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,166
LAUREN TSAI, 18 YEARS OLD
MODEL, ASPIRING ILLUSTRATOR

96
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,044
YUYA SHIBUSAWA, 18 YEARS OLD

AVIAN KU, 26 YEARS OLD
SALESCLERK

ERIC DE MENDONCA, 27 YEARS OLD
CARPENTER

99
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,386
NAOMI LORRAINE FRANK, 23 YEARS OLD
UNDECIDED

100
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,848
YUSUKE AIZAWA, 18 YEARS OLD
MUSICIAN, UKULELE PLAYER

101
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,405
HIRONORI AIZAWA
YUSUKE'S FATHER

102
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,346
It sounds like his dad
saw some wild days in his youth.

103
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,223
"Are you guys dancing at all?"

104
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,976
-That's not a question from a normal dad.
-You're right.

105
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,021
Does that mean
Yusuke normally dances at home?

106
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,564
I thought that, too!

107
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,400
Maybe he's got a special dance
to entertain his family.

108
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,819
Maybe he's outgoing at home
but shy in public.

109
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,073
It'd be hilarious if he busted out
some weird dance from home.

110
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,157
How cute!

111
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,409
-That's adorable!
-So cute!

112
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,912
Lauren and Eric went
to the farmers' market.

113
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,955
It made for a nice scene.

114
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,332
-That's true.
-Yes.

115
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,545
Do you think Lauren is trying to take down
her walls and be friendly

116
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,963
after the cleaning incident last time?

117
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,884
It seems she's making more of an effort
to communicate with everyone.

118
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,345
She didn't realize how people saw her.

119
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,598
It was just important to her
to have her time alone.

120
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:50,437
She was just being her normal self,
but the others were worried about her.

121
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,190
It feels like we might get to see
Yusuke take the initiative soon.

122
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,442
Good luck.

123
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,611
But Yusuke is still
the only one Lauren hugged.

124
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,988
-And the only one she touched, right?
-Right.

125
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,741
When she still had her walls up...

126
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,786
Yusuke was the only one
she let them down for.

127
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:12,709
Or maybe it's because they're the same age
and she feels comfortable hugging him

128
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,879
without there being
any sexual connotations.

129
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,675
Man, that would be so tough on a virgin!

130
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,888
Naomi, what time did you say
you were leaving tomorrow? 8:00 a.m.?

131
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,766
Ummm...
I'm leaving the house around 8:00 a.m.

132
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,726
Isn't that early?

133
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,103
-So early!
-When's takeoff?

134
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,356
My flight's at 11:30 a.m.

135
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,442
-8:00 sounds right, then.
-Yup, 8:00.

136
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,361
Are you sad to be going back to Japan?

137
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,112
A little bit.

138
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,491
-You'll be gone for about a week?
-About a week, yeah.

139
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,658
That's pretty long.

140
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,201
-Yeah, pretty long.
- A whole week!

141
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,537
I wonder what'll happen in the house.

142
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,582
-Yeah, everyone...
-It's going to be so quiet.

143
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,293
-It'll be boring.
-Thanks for saying that.

144
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,463
We should've gone out to eat
for your last night.

145
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,798
-I totally forgot.
-Don't worry about it.

146
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,383
I wanna eat something sweet.

147
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,011
-Wanna go get some dessert?
-Yeah.

148
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,472
-Where should we go? Kahala?
-Kahala.

149
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,306
-Wanna go?
-Yeah, let's go.

150
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,058
-Should we go?
-Let's go.

151
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,853
-Off we go.
-Naomi, you drive.

152
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,399
-No!
-You always scrape the Mustang.

153
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,276
Hey! Stop telling lies!

154
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,490
Will you eat a parfait if I make you one?

155
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,576
Yeah, I'll have it later.

156
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,954
-What do you mean, "later"?
-I've got homework to do.

157
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,541
Really? But the ice cream will melt.

158
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,377
-So I won't make it yet, then.
-Just take the fruit.

159
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,671
I can eat later. No problem.

160
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,215
-Have fun.
-What? Are you going to sleep?

161
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,804
-Me? I'll be in our room.
-In the girls' room? Okay.

162
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,560
-How many kiwis should I use?
-As many as you want.

163
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,395
I'll use two for now.

164
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,939
-I'm gonna go do my homework
-Okay.

165
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,774
Where's he going? Downstairs?

166
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,068
-Probably the bedroom.
-Why?

167
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,403
He's not gonna eat?

168
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,115
-Later, probably.
-He said he'd have some.

169
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,034
Is this enough strawberries?
Are you a strawberry fiend?

170
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,537
-You want more, right?
-Yeah.

171
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,123
-You don't have to give them all to me.
-I know. I just...

172
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,502
-I figured you liked strawberries.
-I love them.

173
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,796
Thanks.

174
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,173
That looks great!

175
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,468
-Let's take it downstairs.
-Okay.

176
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,223
It's cold.

177
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,187
-It's raining a little.
-This is good!

178
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,772
-You're eating already?
-Yeah.

179
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,859
-It's raining a little.
-More than a little!

180
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,404
-This sucks.
-You're right, it's more than a little.

181
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,738
Well, it'll stop.

182
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,827
-You said it's easier to talk outside.
-Yeah, I like it outside.

183
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,036
But it's a bit cold.

184
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,206
-Want a jacket? I'll go get one.
-Yeah, please.

185
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,667
Thanks.

186
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,720
-Thanks!
-Sure.

187
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,806
It's the one I lent you before.

188
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,850
Sorry if it smells.

189
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,895
-Does it smell sweaty?
-Not at all.

190
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,648
-Does it smell like the closet?
-No, it smells more like detergent.

191
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,901
Thanks again.

192
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,154
I wonder if Yusuke is gonna eat.
Maybe I'll make one for him.

193
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,408
Whatever.
I'll make it when he's ready.

194
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,619
-Your last meal.
-Yup.

195
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:35,912
The Last Supper.

196
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,288
It's delicious.

197
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,248
-Thanks for making it.
-No problem.

198
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,752
-Are you sad you'll be gone for a week?
-I am.

199
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,671
-You said you just started being positive.
-Yeah.

200
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,757
What do you mean by "positive"?

201
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,885
In terms of both my work and my love life.

202
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,305
I actually already made a move.

203
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,723
You did?

204
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,475
Really?

205
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,560
That's why Yusuke's not here.

206
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,188
-What?
-I asked him not to come.

207
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,147
You did?

208
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,026
I told him I wanted to talk to you alone
before I left.

209
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,703
What did you want to talk about?

210
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,084
Is it a date?
Did you ask her out on a date?

211
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,752
I did.

212
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,715
Where will you go?

213
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,343
Diamond Head.

214
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,930
-To surf.
-Surfing? What about after that?

215
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,057
We'll go get something to eat.

216
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,185
But...

217
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,896
she doesn't seem to see it that way.

218
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,400
So for now, as long as she has fun
then I'm fine with that.

219
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,862
Have you guys hung out together before?

220
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,865
-We haven't.
-Oh, you haven't.

221
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,326
Not once. You're the only one
I've gone somewhere alone with.

222
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,286
In the beginning.

223
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:03,457
-Back when we went to the beach together
-That was way back in the beginning.

224
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,044
-I don't know if that was a date or what.
-Yeah, whatever that was.

225
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,212
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,590
It was good the way it was.

227
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,426
It was fun for what it was.

228
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,764
It's raining again.

229
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,934
-Yup. Wanna go back inside?
-Yeah, let's go in.

230
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,394
-Before we get cold.
-Okay.

231
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,275
Thanks for the food.

232
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,360
-The dishes are all you.
-Fiiine.

233
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,903
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

234
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,205
Gone to Japan for an Internet TV job.
Naomi

235
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,337
I'm so sleepy. Seriously.

236
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,089
Are you taking the shortboard?

237
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,759
-The longboard today.
-The longboard?

238
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,427
Wait a second!

239
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,847
-Thanks.
-You forgot to turn it on.

240
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,015
Yeah, I forgot.

241
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,519
-Should we load this first?
-Yeah.

242
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,402
It's fine.

243
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,697
The weather's so nice.

244
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,533
-No, it's totally not.
-It totally is.

245
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,786
-Really? Oh, yeah, it is.
-See?

246
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,247
-Diamond Head's got some clouds over it.
-Yeah, you're right.

247
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,249
But I like that.
Like, when...

248
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,087
The rainfall as you sit on your board,
waiting for the wave.

249
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,881
-You like that?
-Yeah, I love it.

250
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,050
I was just thinking...

251
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,178
you're such a romantic, Yuya.

252
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,555
-Surprisingly.
-Surprisingly?

253
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,683
-Am I?
-Yeah, I think so.

254
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,975
Do you prefer romantics?

255
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,729
Yeah, I do.
Romantics are good.

256
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,898
-Is it better to be a romantic?
-Yeah.

257
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,740
There's a rainbow.

258
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,659
Where? Oh, you're right!

259
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,286
That's awesome.

260
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,554
-What do you want to eat?
-What do I want to eat?

261
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,516
Hmmm... That's tough.

262
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,561
Deciding what to eat is tough?

263
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,190
-You're okay with anything?
-I'm okay with anything.

264
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,240
-What's good here? Do you know this place?
-I do!

265
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,493
-You do?
-I love this place.

266
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,286
-Really? Nice.
-Yeah.

267
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,414
-Did I choose a good place?
-Yeah.

268
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,166
-Thanks.
-So, what's good?

269
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,252
-The loco moco is good.
-Oh, maybe I'll have that.

270
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,587
Everything here is good.

271
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,048
You're buying?

272
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,966
Thank you.

273
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,635
It looks so good.

274
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,471
-Looks delicious.
-Looks like breakfast.

275
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,849
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

276
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,308
This is gonna be good.

277
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,560
I'm gonna put some lemon on it.

278
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,270
So good!

279
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,314
Delicious!

280
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,525
I'm so happy!

281
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,694
I feel totally revived.

282
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,739
I'm glad you chose this place.

283
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,284
This place?
I wasn't sure where to take you.

284
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,119
Really? Why?

285
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,914
-I wasn't sure where's good.
-This is so good!

286
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,959
-Sorry to interrupt.
-It is good.

287
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,379
But yeah, I wasn't sure where to go.
I even asked Eric for advice.

288
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,299
I was really surprised.

289
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,927
What do you girls talk about?

290
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,012
We talk about boys and stuff.

291
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,598
You do? So is there someone you like?

292
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,475
Who?

293
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,269
Me?

294
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,479
Right now?

295
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,691
Hmmm...

296
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,569
-No one.
-No one?

297
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,070
No.

298
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,823
-No, but...
-No, but?

299
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,035
-No, but... you know.
-What?

300
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,704
"You know" what?

301
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,998
Are you interested in anyone?

302
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,082
Right now?

303
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,460
You are?

304
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,177
Let's go eat somewhere again.

305
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,431
-What?
-Let's go to that other place next time.

306
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,267
The other place you said was good.

307
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,978
-Let's go there next time.
-Sure.

308
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,605
Let's go.

309
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,398
Would you go if I asked you again?

310
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,441
Yeah.

311
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,401
I'll go.

312
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,444
Plan on it, then.

313
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,822
-Let's go.
-Will you make the plans?

314
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,242
-A lot happened.
-Yeah.

315
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,287
-A lot.
-First, Naomi's going to Japan for work.

316
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,623
-She sort of confessed her feelings.
-She did!

317
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,044
-But what happened?
-He lightly...

318
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,504
-Yuya lightly brushed it off.
-He did.

319
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,922
Like this.

320
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,386
-And Naomi lightly went to Japan.
-Yes, she did.

321
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,889
She said, "I already made a move."

322
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,018
Do you know the manga Nana?

323
00:23:56,102 --> 00:24:00,314
There's a famous scene where Sachiko says,
"It was on purpose."

324
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,484
She's having a drink with a guy she likes.

325
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,113
When it gets late, she says,
"I'll miss the last train."

326
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,906
The guy says,
"Hurry. Run. It's your last train."

327
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:15,704
But as they run up the stairs
at the station, Sachiko trips

328
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,207
and misses the last train.

329
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,918
The guy says, "Oh, no, you missed it."
But Sachiko says,

330
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,046
"It was on purpose."

331
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,424
-Oh, that's good.
-Right?

332
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,093
It was like that.

333
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,388
"I already made a move."

334
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,267
She reveals her intentions indirectly.

335
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,560
She's not gonna have fun on that plane.

336
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,938
-She'll be thinking about a lot.
-Like what everyone's up to.

337
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,900
To be gone for a week at this point...

338
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,486
-It's a little too long, isn't it?
-It's long.

339
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,782
And Yuya is pretty forward with Avian.

340
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,743
-He makes new plans with her.
-Right.

341
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,079
It's nice when a guy is forward.

342
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,790
-It is nice.
-He's confident.

343
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:05,462
When Yuya asks,
"So is there someone you like?"

344
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,507
And Avian says,
"Hmmm..."

345
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,800
"No one."

346
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,178
-After that "no one..."
-Those sunglasses...

347
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,431
may have been hiding her feelings.

348
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,477
"Thank goodness I have these.
He can't see how nervous I am."

349
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:27,359
She isn't in love with Yuya or anything,
but she's willing to go out.

350
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:31,655
-She said "but" at the end.
-Yes, as in, "but this is a possibility."

351
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,949
-Like, we don't know what may happen?
-Yeah.

352
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:39,538
When she asks Yuya, "What about you?"
He says, "Yeah, there's someone."

353
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,915
-"You do?"
-It seems so fun.

354
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,419
The expression
after the "there is someone."

355
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,754
That expression was so good.

356
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,005
That was good.

357
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,218
-So many great scenes, right?
-So many.

358
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:57,181
-Did you guys make dinner today?
-No, I haven't eaten yet.

359
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,474
-You haven't?
-No.

360
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,350
When did you get back?

361
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,686
Around 7:00.

362
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,566
I ate a lot for lunch,
so I'm not hungry at all.

363
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,904
-The pasta that took three hours?
-Yeah.

364
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,031
Oh, and today...

365
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,619
we had a meeting about the pop-up store.

366
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,996
Will you come around and look?

367
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,336
This wall and all...

368
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,463
This front wall...

369
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,841
-We were wondering what to do.
-Okay.

370
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,678
We were going to just paint it at first...

371
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,683
but then we thought we'd put wallpaper
and add a pattern.

372
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,770
But since we came up with that...

373
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,899
we haven't been able to settle on one.

374
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,819
Something geometric like this?

375
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,113
That'll definitely look good.

376
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,031
-It's stylish.
-Like this...

377
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,701
-Oh, I really like that.
-It's nice, right? Kind of modern.

378
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,499
The design we'll use for the pop-up...

379
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,416
Yeah.

380
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:12,798
We want a design
we can use for future stores.

381
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,175
So you want something like this

382
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,471
If you see this,
you'd think "Oh, it's Punch Bowl Café."

383
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,267
That's what we want.
Something like this.

384
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,770
Are you drawing that yourself?

385
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,733
-Or are you printing it?
-So that's where I want your help.

386
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,068
Of course!

387
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,573
Help me out, then!

388
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,284
If we can do this...

389
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,830
we can keep using it in future stores.

390
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,501
I talked about asking Lauren out, right?

391
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,463
But I haven't been able to do anything.

392
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,634
I still haven't been able to...

393
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:02,806
mentally prepare myself.

394
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,396
You should be able
to ask her out on a date.

395
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,818
But Lauren's always doing something.

396
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,153
Like when she's drawing.

397
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,491
She says she doesn't mind talking,

398
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,995
but I feel like I shouldn't bother her.

399
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,705
I can't help but think that way.

400
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,583
And then I end up...

401
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,877
-You can't talk.
-Yeah, I fall silent.

402
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:38,550
I want to talk to her
when she's 100% focused.

403
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,093
Focused on drawing?

404
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,264
-When she's focused on the conversation.
-Oh, I see.

405
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,600
Why don't you just try talking with her?

406
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,229
A normal conversation.
Like, "Hey, let's talk."

407
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,525
And talk outside by the pool or something.

408
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:59,946
If you can do that,
it might make things easier.

409
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,327
It's also easier to ask
if the two of you are already talking.

410
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:14,085
It's really unknown territory for me.
Seriously.

411
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,631
Do you totally have no clue?

412
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,843
Yeah, I've seriously never considered...

413
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,389
asking someone out on a date before.

414
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,561
But still...

415
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:37,443
it's important I find
my own way of doing it...

416
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,321
I think.
