1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:18,393
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers picked to live in a house

3
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,187
and have their lives taped.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,649
All that has been prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,776
There is no script at all.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,949
Last time, there was the surfing issue...

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,244
Lauren and Avian had a talk with Eric.

8
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,456
But the issue was solved Western-style,
very nice and short.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,625
-They talked it out.
-Yes.

10
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,433
Coming to Hawaii from Japan...

11
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,270
So if I can't get along
with the people here...

12
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,273
then...

13
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:10,362
I'm not going to have any friends.

14
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,489
Incidentally...

15
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,118
Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece
and a fan of Terrace House,

16
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,286
texted me after the first episode.

17
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,914
"Yamachan, I'm worried about Eric.

18
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,043
He's the kind of guy that
says stuff that starts trouble."

19
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,419
Wow!

20
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,213
Man, he's on top of things.

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:32,009
I wrote back, "I'm speechless.
You are ridiculously observant."

22
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,723
But anyways,
the most important part about the talk

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,350
was how Lauren refused to hug.

24
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:45,105
Her saying she's not "touchy-feely"
comes back into play later on.

25
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,566
-Yeah, it will. That was a good one.
-It was really, really good.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,780
I was just about to come to you.
Is that for me?

27
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,157
-Good job.
-Thank you.

28
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,786
And this vibe between Yusuke and Lauren...

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,956
-He's wants a date.
-Yes, he wanted to ask her out.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,293
He tried, but then she suggests
they all go out together.

31
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
What days are you off?

32
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,090
Friday and Saturday this week.

33
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,216
That's perfect.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,218
Let's all go to the North Shore.

35
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,513
-Everyone together is fine one time.
-Taking it step by step.

36
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,391
He finally says he's interested in her.

37
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,729
I really like the way
her imagination works.

38
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,938
Ahhh...

39
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,066
Dumb and Dumber just nod along.

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,653
And Yuya said
he's going to make Avian fall for him.

41
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,155
-He sure did, didn't he?
-Yes, he did.

42
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,701
Avian and I have been talking
a lot lately.

43
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,911
-For real?
-Yeah, she's gonna be mine.

44
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,955
-I wonder how he's going to make his move.
-Me too.

45
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,084
So the North Shore date is a group date.

46
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,502
-And it's this week.
-Everyone all together.

47
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,344
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

48
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,763
Naomi, can I get your headphones?
I lost mine.

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,473
-Sure.
-Thank you.

50
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,058
-Are earbuds okay?
-Yes.

51
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,102
You having breakfast or just coffee?

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,019
Just coffee.

53
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,731
-Why did you wake up so early?
-You only slept for like two hours.

54
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,235
I couldn't sleep.
It's like the night before a field trip.

55
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,071
-You were too excited?
-Yeah, way too excited.

56
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,865
-I got up early.
-Just like a kid.

57
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,616
Shall we, then?

58
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,493
-Let's do it.
-Let's go!

59
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,330
I guess I'm good with
just my phone and wallet.

60
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,333
-Did everyone pack their goggles?
-Yeah.

61
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,502
Uh-oh...

62
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,546
What's up?

63
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,464
-Are we all gonna fit?
-No way.

64
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,718
-I'll hop in the back.
-Me too!

65
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,387
-Let's sit together.
-Okay.

66
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,264
Can you hand me a towel?

67
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,727
I love Shepherds.
Like, German Shepherds.

68
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,906
Don't be like that.

69
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,667
-I wanna live in a place like this.
-That would be nice.

70
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,391
-With lots of dogs and cats.
-Nice.

71
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,601
This is totally the countryside.

72
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,148
-This doesn't feel like Hawaii.
-You're right.

73
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,317
-This is totally Hawaii!
-Extreme Hawaii!

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,444
-This is as Hawaii as it gets.
-Really?

75
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,362
-Really.
-This is the real Hawaii.

76
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,199
Yeah, the real Hawaii.
Not the resort Hawaii.

77
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,101
What did you get?

78
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,064
Are you excited?
You don't really like the beach, right?

79
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,025
-Not really.
-Me either.

80
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,153
-Are you going to swim?
-I'm not sure.

81
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,118
-Thanks.
-I'm wearing waterproof makeup today.

82
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,246
-That exists?
-Yeah.

83
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,749
-I don't think you even need makeup.
-Well, thank you very much.

84
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,627
Well, aren't you the sweet one, Yusuke.

85
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,567
I used to come here every week.

86
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,570
-Why?
-Just for fun.

87
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,364
-To go diving.
-By yourself?

88
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,449
-With friends.
-Let's come next week.

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,617
You wanna?

90
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,287
-Where'd you jump in from?
-Those rocks over there.

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,872
-There?
-Yeah.

92
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,457
-We can't go out there.
-Oh yes we can.

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,002
-There are red flags up.
-They always been there?

94
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,629
-I don't see any signs.
-We still can't go in.

95
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,340
-Why not?
-Because there are red flags!

96
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,967
I wonder how the waves are.

97
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,802
-They look rough.
-This is awesome!

98
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,720
It's so blue.

99
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,765

-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit!

106
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,391
Mmmm!

107
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,602
Wow, that's good!

108
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,812
This is dangerous.

109
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,815
No kissing after eating this.
The garlic's too strong.

110
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,568
It's all good. No one will mind.

111
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,654
Is this a famous spot in Hawaii?

112
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,863
Yeah, pretty famous.

113
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,369
Everyone knows Giovanni's is the place
for garlic shrimp.

114
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,328
Wow!

115
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,581
Yusuke, you brought your ukulele
but you didn't play.

116
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,043
-You forgot.
-You totally forgot.

117
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,795
Yeah, I did.

118
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,046
On the beach?

119
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,840
-Yeah, I had it with me.
-You did?

120
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,136
-I'm gonna wash my hands.
-[with mouth full] Me too.

121
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,638
-That hit the spot.
-Yeah, it did.

122
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,937
How's your day going?

123
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,855
-Today?
-Yeah.

124
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,608
-I wonder if I got a tan.
-A tan?

125
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,069
Or am I still a little pale?

126
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,656
-You were passed out for a while.
-Yeah, I took a little power nap.

127
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,160
Do you want dessert?

128
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,620
-You're still hungry?
-What's on the menu?

129
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,542
-I'll go get it. My treat.
-We can all share.

130
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,547
Whoa.

131
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,845
What was that for?

132
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,888
-Can I have some?
-That was nice.

133
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,308
-Is it good?
-What are you getting?

134
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,976
So this is what it tastes like.

135
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:36,238
-It's not very sweet.
-It's very coconutty.

136
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,697
It tastes natural.

137
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,451
-What happened with your job, Lauren?
-My job?

138
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,160
I can't believe you got fired.

139
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,750
And it was only four days.
I can't believe it, either.

140
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,713
Wait, can you explain what happened again?
What was the reason?

141
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:58,385
Four hours after work, I got a call.
Just one call.

142
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,888
And they said,
"Please don't come in tomorrow."

143
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,516
-Are you serious?
-Like, just don't come in.

144
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,269
-Out of nowhere?
-There's a bunch of new employees,

145
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,313
so they're probably just
looking for the hardest workers.

146
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,691
And you were never late or made a mistake?

147
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,777
-I was still training.
-That's not cool.

148
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,155
So even if I did make a mistake,
well, I was still in training.

149
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,615
That's what training's for.

150
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,117
Of course I don't know everything.

151
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,288
-But Lorraine's got news. This Monday...
-Yup.

152
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,165
-She starts.
-First day on the job!

153
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,000
-Really?
-Didn't I tell you?

154
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,084
No, I didn't know.

155
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,004
-I'm starting at Tommy Bahama on Monday.
-Seriously?

156
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,382
-Finally escaping boredom?
-Yeah, finally!

157
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,926
-Let's go see her in action.
-Yeah, let's all go.

158
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,678
Come after I get used to it.

159
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,558
You were alone with Lauren at one point.
Behind us.

160
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,353
-Yeah.
-The four of us were down in the sand.

161
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,439
I noticed you guys were behind us.

162
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,274
I thought you were making your move,
then and there.

163
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,110
-But you joined us pretty quick.
-Sorry to disappoint.

164
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,238
She fell asleep for a bit.

165
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,326
-She did?
-Yeah, she took a nap and...

166
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,746
I couldn't find the right timing.
I know I shouldn't worry about that.

167
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,916
-But you do?
-Yeah, I can't help it.

168
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,627
She seemed really exhausted.

169
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,922
I thought it might be a bad idea
to try talking to her.

170
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,883
Like, maybe the timing just wasn't right.

171
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,721
That part's hard for me,
since I don't have a lot of experience.

172
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,598
You never know what'll happen
if you don't take a shot.

173
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,225
Yeah, that's true.

174
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,729
But if I come on too strong,
she might think I'm annoying.

175
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,523
-Is that a thing?
-If that happens, you fix it.

176
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,275
You fix it.

177
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,777
So I should fix it after the fact?

178
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:44,240
It doesn't always work this way, but...

179
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,118
when it comes to love...

180
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:52,081
If you don't get to know someone,
you'll never be able to get close.

181
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,750
-Not to that person.
-For sure.

182
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,503
That's true.
I guess I kinda blew it.

183
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,422
I think you overthink things all the time.

184
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,799
I don't think I have the confidence yet.

185
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,012
-You mean to talk?
-Yeah, talking, and like...

186
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,139
Being able to respond to people.

187
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:13,227
Responding to whatever they might say.
I just don't have that mentality yet.

188
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,231
Yeah, if you talk to someone and they
don't like what you say, it can hurt.

189
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,319
What about you?

190
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,781
Me? With Avian?

191
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,700
What's your plan?

192
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,827
I just have to go for it and see.

193
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,831
But it's gonna hurt if she turns me down.

194
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,962
The joy you feel when you try
and it goes well is amazing.

195
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,215
-Yeah?
-You feel so happy.

196
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,133
Sounds nice.

197
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,053
Get your confidence, get the girl.
That the plan?

198
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,471
Yeah, definitely.

199
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:50,973
Good.

200
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,101
Okay.

201
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,651
In my own way.

202
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,444
Damn it.

203
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,755
-What a beautiful place.
-It sure is.

204
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,132
-North Shore.
-North Shore.

205
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,968
Everyone on the road together.

206
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,471
-To be young again!
-To be in that truck bed!

207
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,223
-That's the best seat!
-Aw, it's the dream!

208
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,143
-That's illegal in Japan, right?
-Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.

209
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,020
I'd settle for a popped trunk.

210
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,065
I'd love to ride around Hawaii
sitting in a popped trunk.

211
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,985
Yusuke was so shy around Lauren.

212
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,405
But it was nice when he told her
she doesn't need makeup.

213
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,950
Yeah, she thanked him
and said he was sweet.

214
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:56,163
That whole vibe came out
because of the type of guy Yusuke is.

215
00:15:56,247 --> 00:16:00,251
If Hugh Hefner or some womanizer
told a girl she's cute without makeup,

216
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,630
-it wouldn't be the same.
-Not at all.

217
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,256
It's his purity.

218
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,341
-You know he's not scheming.
-Right.

219
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,511
"She looks like an angel
standing in front of that register."

220
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,722
That's the thought
behind the makeup line.

221
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,474
Acting out the virgin?

222
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,768
His version of a virgin.

223
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,436
Some other facts came to light over lunch.

224
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,732
Lauren was fired from her job.

225
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,194
When she said she got fired
over the phone after four days on the job,

226
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,446
Yusuke was like,
"Are you serious?"

227
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,198
-He got upset.
-Yes, he showed...

228
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,950
-Some emotion.
-Yeah, he did.

229
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,494
-That was good.
-Yes, it was.

230
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,329
He's not gonna go file a complaint
or anything, is he?

231
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,249
Stage a sit-in outside her work.

232
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,292
Ukulele in hand.

233
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,294
Like some drifter.

234
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,755
What the hell'd you do

235
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,217
To my Laaauren?

236
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,557
They'd be like, "Beat it, punk.
Get outta here!"

237
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,517
"I ain't movin'."

238
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,935
"I ain't movin'."

239
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,729
How about Yuya's
relationship advice to Yusuke?

240
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,774
-It was good though, right?
-Yes, it went well.

241
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,069
He's a good kid when Eric's not around.

242
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,030
So Eric's a bad influence on him.

243
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,490
-Ahhh.
-That might be it.

244
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,993
Sounds like Yuya's
got his sights set on Avian.

245
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,954
He said he's going to go for it.

246
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,331
After Yuya left the room...

247
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,250
Yusuke mumbled to himself,

248
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,043
"In my own way."

249
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,713
And then just headed off to bed.

250
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,881
There's people who actually do that, huh?

251
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,258
He was talking to himself, huh?

252
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,052
He says important stuff out loud.

253
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,554
Maybe that talk hit home.

254
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,556
-He threw himself into bed.
-Yeah.

255
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,766
That'll make you do that.

256
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,312
-But that wooden bed didn't even creak.
-Not a peep.

257
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,357
-That's solid craftsmanship.
-That's what you care about?

258
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:02,874
ELLIOTT GRAHAM, 23 YEARS OLD
CREATIVE DIRECTOR

259
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,965
-Mr. Ono.
-That's me.

260
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,925
TSUYOSHI ONO
VICE PRESIDENT, UNIBAZAR

261
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,302
-Hey.
-Hey.

262
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,012
I brought the pop-up plans.

263
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,972
'08 GRADUATED MARIST INTERNATIONAL

264
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,725
'14 MOVED TO HAWAII
'16 JOINED WINDWOOD FINE FINISH

265
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,310
LAST RELATIONSHIP: 3 YEARS AGO

266
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,896
It's finally almost finished.

267
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,313
-You mean the plan?
-Yes.

268
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,945
Nice, nice.

269
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,157
The wall here...

270
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,618
starts here.

271
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,164
It would come out from here.

272
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,709
-About here?
-Yeah, about here.

273
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,336
Oh, wow.

274
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,174
-It would look like this from the front.
-That looks really good.

275
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,053
You've got the outside sketch, too?

276
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,181
The outside...

277
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,811
-This is the view from the outside.
-Punch Bowl Café.

278
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,105
-Punch Bowl Café?
-Yes, that's the name.

279
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,107
-It sounds good.
-That's it for now.

280
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:17,699
We want to match the vibe of the store.

281
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,241
That's the plan.

282
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,622
-Wanna sit down?
-Yeah, thanks.

283
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,624
Are you okay?

284
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,174
I feel like I haven't seen you
for a while.

285
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,884
-Lauren?
-Yeah.

286
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:41,305
I saw you yesterday, but not today.

287
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,265
Yeah, not at all today.

288
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,187
Did something happen?

289
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:55,236
Nothing happened, but from now on...

290
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,197
since we're living together...

291
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,366
Well, it's been about a month now?

292
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,160
Yeah, almost a month.

293
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,289
So since we live together,
maybe we should have some rules.

294
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,165
Okay.

295
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:14,505
For example,
we all share the toilet, bath, and shower.

296
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,051
So, if the toilet paper runs out...

297
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:25,557
then someone should
grab a new one and replace it.

298
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:31,605
We weren't doing that, but it'd be nice
if we could from here on out.

299
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,773
Yeah.

300
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:37,486
And it would be nice
if everyone could keep their area clean.

301
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,490
We all share the space, so...

302
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,408
Okay.

303
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,163
And like, the towels, for example...

304
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,542
Sometimes there's a bunch of used towels
that aren't hung back up.

305
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,129
They're all wet
and lying all over the place.

306
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,382
And you think that's me?

307
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,720
-No, not at all. I don't know who it is.
-No, no.

308
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:08,225
But since we all live here,
we should decide...

309
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,937
We should set some rules.

310
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,940
Yeah.

311
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,197
There is just one thing
I wanted to ask you to do, Lauren.

312
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,114
Okay.

313
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,952
Around the closet...

314
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,496
there's some used dishes sitting there.

315
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,999
And they've been there for a while.

316
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,376
-Could you clean those up?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,629
I'll do that. I was thinking that, too.

318
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,800
-I shouldn't have to do that.
-You're right, my bad.

319
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,134
That's all. Sorry to ask.

320
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,221
Yeah.

321
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,432
Let's all just make sure we
clean up after ourselves.

322
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,517
That's a pretty simple rule.

323
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,561
Yeah.

324
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,899
-What are you doing?
-My English homework.

325
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,110
Um...

326
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,027
Ethan Aizawa...

327
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,572
-You go by Ethan?
-Yeah, it's my real name.

328
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,242
What about your homework, Yuya?

329
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,576
I'm too lazy.

330
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,995
-You have class tomorrow, right?
-I do.

331
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,331
But it's fine.

332
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,376
There was only
one homework assignment today.

333
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,211
Just for my last class.

334
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,510
Good evening.

335
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,429
-Hey.
-Hi everyone.

336
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,223
So, what's up?

337
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,475
We wanted to talk about cleaning.

338
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,810
-Are we making chores?
-Yup!

339
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,356
Ugh, do we really have to?

340
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,608
I knew you'd say that.

341
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,570
-We might have different perspectives.
-True, true, true.

342
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,158
-So this might be the easiest way.
-You're right.

343
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,619
-Since it'll be written.
-Yeah, for everyone.

344
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,704
-It'll be the easiest way.
-Okay.

345
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,872
-I think.
-Yeah.

346
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,125
-Please just give it a shot.
-Of course.

347
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,127
If we're gonna do it, I'll do my part.

348
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,336
I'll vacuum this week.

349
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,797
VACUUM: ERIC, YUYA, NAOMI
MOP: LAUREN, AVIAN, YUSUKE

350
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,675
-You cool with that, Yuya?
-Yeah, totally.

351
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,978
What were you girls talking about?

352
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,980
Cleaning.

353
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,066
-Cleaning?
-Yeah.

354
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,734
Did things get awkward
from talking about cleaning?

355
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,862
Just a little.

356
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:30,201
Did it get so bad you didn't
even want to see her?

357
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,541
-It's cool if you don't wanna tell me.
-It's not that...

358
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,377
Then...

359
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,214
Let's go talk somewhere else.

360
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,007
Alright. Alright.

361
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,720
I'm gonna go hear all the dirt.

362
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,650
Before we all sat down...

363
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,737
just us girls
were talking about cleaning.

364
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,199
-In your room?
-Yeah, in the girls' room.

365
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:16,622
And it's something Avian and I
have been talking about for a while.

366
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,793
So it's obvious to us we aren't the ones
who are making a mess.

367
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,296
I'd ask Avian if a mess was hers,
and she'd say no.

368
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,800
And she'd ask if a mess was mine,
and I'd say no. It happened all the time.

369
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,929
So when we just talked to Lauren about it,

370
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,142
we didn't point any fingers at her.

371
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,478
We said we should all make some rules.

372
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:44,275
And then Lauren just told me that...

373
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:50,239
she felt like we were saying she
was in the wrong and we were accusing her.

374
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:55,119
But I thought if we said we know
she's the one making the mess...

375
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,914
it would make her upset.

376
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,751
Well, I can understand how Lauren feels.

377
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,420
First of all...

378
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,007
it means she knows you and Avian
were talking about her.

379
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,884
That could make her sad.

380
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,554
I mean, one of you could
just tell Lauren,

381
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:18,059
"Hey, you never put things back.
Could you start trying to?"

382
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,228
At first, we did think
that one of us should just tell her.

383
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:25,649
But in that case, if I'm not there,
and Avian asks Lauren if she did it

384
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,653
and she says, "No, it wasn't me,"
we couldn't prove that we know it was.

385
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,824
But if Avian asked her and I was there,

386
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,078
Lauren can't just say, "It wasn't me."

387
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,995
But then it's two against one.

388
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,831
-Yeah.
-In the end.

389
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,083
Isn't that unfair?

390
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,086
You're ganging up on Lauren
with your opinions.

391
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,713
If Lauren lies,
then that's just who she is.

392
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,550
But I doubt she's the type of person
who'd lie about something like that.

393
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,510
Even if she lies about it...

394
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,806
you and Avian both know
it isn't either of you.

395
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,434
So Avian could say,
"Naomi says it wasn't her."

396
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,060
She could just say that.

397
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,813
What would happen
if you just told her?

398
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,485
Well, Lauren's pretty outspoken.

399
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:14,406
I was afraid she'd say,
"Whatever, you're a jerk."

400
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,907
That's ridiculous.

401
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,495
-That's so ridiculous.
-I know, but...

402
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,413
You have to just speak up.

403
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,040
Otherwise, it might be taken
the wrong way.

404
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,504
Thank you. You give such good advice.

405
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,924
-I...
-Well, this whole thing is ridiculous.

406
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:38,847
I know, but I thought
you'd be rougher on me about it.

407
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,057
Like, tell you you're wrong?

408
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,560
Or like, "Why can't you just say it?"

409
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,522
But thank you
for wording things so gently.

410
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,151
I feel a lot better.

411
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,570
I was feeling stressed about it.

412
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,599
CHRISTINE TSAI, 23 YEARS OLD
LAUREN'S OLDER SISTER

413
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,944
-Let me get that out of the way.
-Sorry.

414
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,540
Is everything okay?

415
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,417
Yeah, it's fine.

416
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,128
Just, we had the talk
about cleaning yesterday, right?

417
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,755
-The three of us?
-Yeah.

418
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,759
I wanted to apologize about that.

419
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,430
I wanted to say something, too...

420
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,310
about the bathroom and the rules.

421
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:36,358
The talk made it seem
like it was all my fault.

422
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,778
But, for example,
we can see who's hair is left.

423
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,489
We all have different hair.

424
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:46,577
No one's been perfect...

425
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,080
so it would've been nice
if it was put more nicely.

426
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:54,418
If there's an issue, you can just tell me.

427
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,920
Like with the dishes.

428
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:01,508
I know that's my fault,
so I'm happy you told me.

429
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:04,886
I'm glad. That's all I wanted to say.

430
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,430
Me too.

431
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:12,686
If you were living in a house
with six people...

432
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,399
wouldn't you want to pick up
after yourself?

433
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,569
Wouldn't you just pick stuff up and say,
"Hey, whose is this?

434
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,573
That's what a mom would say.

435
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,703
Like, "Hey, isn't this yours, Granny?"

436
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,455
Sorry!

437
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,791
-Can't they make the exchange fun?
-Yes, on the spot.

438
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,586
I didn't think Yuya's stock would rise,

439
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,340
but he is showing some signs
of increasing value today.

440
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,717
-Yes.
-He's doing well.

441
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,220
Lauren's not scary, but...

442
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,932
maybe Naomi is trying
to be careful around her.

443
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:55,103
But really, Naomi planned
to gang up on her.

444
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,190
Instead of telling Lauren herself,
Naomi used Avian to corner her.

445
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,778
Yes, it's kind of nice.
We're seeing signs of unpleasantness.

446
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,821
I don't know.

447
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,659
I was wondering what I was gonna do
since Yuya was off my enemies list

448
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,452
and Eric was the only one left,

449
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,704
but it looks like I've got a replacement!

450
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,956
I don't know if she falls onto that list.

451
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,125
She's just really girly.

452
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,922
Avian seems like the type to suggest
everyone talk about it.

453
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,551
-I think she was accommodating Naomi.
-I see, she did it for her.

454
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:31,432
I see, she used
Avian's understanding nature.

455
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,891
Hey...

456
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,102
You put it so meanly.

457
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,938
What do you mean, "used"?
There's power in words.

458
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,525
Excuse me. It's up to you
to take it however you will.

459
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,911
-Work?
-I haven't touched it today. It's bad.

460
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,747
I'd be in a better spot
if I did some this afternoon.

461
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,584
-If you weren't watching Terrace House?
-Yeah.

462
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,086
Definitely if I wasn't watching
Terrace House.

463
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,672
I watched a lot today.

464
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:09,720
When Byrnes told Misaki how he felt
in Yokohama...

465
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,805
-I watched it all today.
-Really?

466
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,515
I haven't seen that yet.

467
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,852
-Sorry! Spoilers!
-Don't worry about it.

468
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,854
I still don't know what she says.

469
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,230
She says...

470
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,189
Don't tell me!

471
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,360
I can't wait to watch it.

472
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,905
I was gonna try to come up
with some concepts today.

473
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,700
I had my sketchbook out.

474
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,244
I had everything ready.

475
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,372
But I just blanked for like an hour.

476
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,958
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey.

477
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,962
You just couldn't decide
what to work on the whole time?

478
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,130
Your designs?

479
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:50,385
Yeah, I wanted to start today,
but nothing came to me.

480
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,223
Yeah, I really want to hurry up
and build this pop-up store.

481
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,519
I want to see it. I want to go already.

482
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,605
-Starting next week...
-Next week?

483
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,440
-We start building if we can.
-Next week?

484
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,943
We're just starting to build.

485
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:12,198
-I thought you meant finish.
-That won't be for two or three weeks.

486
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,076
-If we work hard.
-I'll come visit when it's done.

487
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,745
Yeah, come on by.

488
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,874
We've been here for a month...

489
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,125
but there isn't much...

490
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,795
-How can I put it?
-I know.

491
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,924
-Nothing's really happened.
-Yup, not really.

492
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:33,553
Previous seasons of Terrace House
had things happen immediately.

493
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,516
-Like, a week into it.
-Yeah, like Byrnes, for example.

494
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,100
-Yeah.
-Like what I saw today.

495
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,520
He came and immediately liked Misaki.

496
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,438
He went for it right away?

497
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,482
He immediately knew he liked her.

498
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:51,196
That kind of thing hasn't happened, but...

499
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,408
there are moments when it feels like
something could happen.

500
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,370
Especially with Naomi.

501
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,834
I know what you mean.
Things seem to be going well lately.

502
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:08,964
From my perspective,
I think Yuya just sees her as a friend.

503
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:13,134
But for example, Yuya's...

504
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,471
-His earring?
-His earring is Naomi's.

505
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,557
-That's true.
-He's wearing hers.

506
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,768
-They straighten their hair together.
-Really?

507
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,519
That's the first I heard of that.

508
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,188
-Yeah.
-I didn't know at all.

509
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,656
Did someone knock?

510
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,324
-I'm coming in.
-Okay.

511
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,458
I wanted to talk to Avian.

512
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,377
-Avian? Oh, should I...
-No, stay.

513
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,963
-You sure?
-It's fine. Are you free Sunday?

514
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,048
-Yeah.
-You're free?

515
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,551
In the morning.

516
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:59,640
Let's go surfing in the morning
and then grab some food.

517
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,557
Just the two of us.

518
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,143
Just the two of us?

519
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,771
Sure.

520
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,983
-That's all.
-Alright, let's go.

521
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,987
-Sunday, then.
-Sunday. Okay.

522
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,781
Surfing.

523
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,075
-Good night.
-Good night.

524
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,535
Good night.

525
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,454
Should I have left?

526
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,373
Left? No.

527
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,543
-Why?
-Well...

528
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,253
he came to ask you out,

529
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,506
so I thought
maybe you guys wanted to talk more.

530
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,426
Isn't it just to go surfing and eat?

531
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,845
I don't know.

532
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,514
I think so, right?
