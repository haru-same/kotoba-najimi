1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:18,226
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,853
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,356
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,193
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,779
Saito is here tonight once again.

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,824
-Oh, it's Saito?
-Yes, I'm Saito. Yes.

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,160
I supply my own wardrobe for the show.

9
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,956
I carefully plan out my outfits
before I come on Terrace House,

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,209
so the ratio of the cost of my clothes
to my income is going up.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,170
Are you going to wear those Ray-bans
during the show?

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,339
I was just trying to decide.

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,969
I was going to get your opinion
and then maybe take them off.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,597
You look like a pro bass fisherman.

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,100
Last week...

16
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,854
-Guy, our favorite...
-Guy...

17
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,857
-The real life Winnie-the-Pooh.
-He's so adorable!

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,902
-He is a pro surfer.
-He looked really cool.

19
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,531
-We loved the contrast.
-We love how relaxed he is.

20
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:16,952
-And Yuya and Avian are doing well.
-That's right.

21
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,954
They had their Christmas date.

22
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:23,125
They said how they liked each other
pretty frequently during dinner.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,294
The fact that I like you won't change.

24
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,880
I've liked you from the start.
That hasn't changed.

25
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,840
And it won't change.

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,424
I like you, Yuya.

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,012
However, Yuya forgot her gift.

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,723
I got excited when they started to fight.

29
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,391
-Is this good?
-Yeah.

30
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,438
I'm so happy.
You know how much I like earrings.

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,819
-And bracelets.
-I know you like this kind of stuff.

32
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,780
That issue was resolved though.

33
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,532
The issue is
whether they're officially dating or not.

34
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,200
-That's right!
-That happened.

35
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,412
They have don't agree
on what being in a relationship means.

36
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,956
-We're not in a relationship.
-You're not?

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,627
-Why not? Why are you not?
-What about it?

38
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,712
What's it mean
to be in a relationship?

39
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,964
-If I may ask?
-He's getting all worked up.

40
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,050
I'm wondering how
you define a relationship.

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,220
-What does it mean for you?
-I don't like undefined relationships.

42
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,474
-Have you had similar experiences?
-I've had a few.

43
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,895
-You're popular with the ladies, right?
-I can't say that I'm not.

44
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,733
So in your case,
when things start to go well,

45
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,821
what do you say when she asks,
"Are we exclusive?"

46
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,365
I'll keep it vague at first,

47
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,576
but it always ends up being exclusive.

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,287
So you go along with it.

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,331
So, in the past--

50
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,624
Hold on, please be quiet.

51
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,377
Hey, I've been doing this for 22 years.

52
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,088
What do you mean, "Be quiet"?

53
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,299
I'm sorry. Please excuse her, Tokui.

54
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,930
I was just wondering how many girlfriends
you've had in the past?

55
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,141
Ten, but I've been in love with more.

56
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,937
Does that mean
you were rejected by the rest?

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,439
-There's that.
-That's right.

58
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,442
That too, but you know,
there were "adult" relationships, too.

59
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,488
-You mean the one-night kind?
-Well, not necessarily...

60
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,656
But some relationships
have only one focus.

61
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,700
-Wow.
-Amazing.

62
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,785
Were there a lot?

63
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,537
It might turn you off if I answer that.

64
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,834
It must be a lot then.

65
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,128
I can't really say in front of Kentaro.

66
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,838
There was a good number though.

67
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,717
There was a program a long time ago.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,803
Women who've had
relationships with Saito came on.

69
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,640
Yes, with a comedian,
from Tombo Entertainment.

70
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,434
-The women said he was very skilled.
-Oh, you mean...

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,146
Yes, I've been told I'm skilled.

72
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,191
-You're good then.
-At doing the deed?

73
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,777
It seems I'm skilled, yes.

74
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,611
I'm very service-oriented.

75
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,238
Look, look.

76
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,825
-She's looking it up.
-You don't know.

77
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,869
Maybe she's looking up
Tombo Entertainment.

78
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,749
-She's not looking it up.
-No, no.

79
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,129
-You're very popular.
-Yes, I think women appreciate that.

80
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,551
-Oh, it fell.
-Yes, it did.

81
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,594
-Thank you.
-Backwards?

82
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,764
Are you a professional gamer now?

83
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,350
You suddenly look like
a guy who flies a drone.

84
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,604
-I'm sure Anna knows.
-You think?

85
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,649
That you're coming on to her.

86
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,610
-I wonder.
-Do you have a next move?

87
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,572
Should I ask her on a date?
Is it too early?

88
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,825
And then Lauren and Taishi...

89
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,702
-Yes, her feelings.
-Taishi's impressive.

90
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,621
After I went to dinner with Taishi...

91
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,582
Not dinner, I mean lunch.

92
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,002
I thought he was really... nice.

93
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,338
And you were Taishi's Secret Santa.

94
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,174
I really thought about what he'd like,

95
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,052
and I thought he'd like a soccer ball.

96
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,598
I heard that Taishi is already interested
in someone else.

97
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,267
You should go on a date with Taishi.

98
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,104
I do want to get to know him better.

99
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,273
I'm happy someone
finally caught Lauren's eye.

100
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,525
-I'm sad though.
-Why?

101
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,695
-I really liked Lauren.
-Oh, you liked Lauren.

102
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,991
She has the look of love though.

103
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,659
I have conflicted feelings.

104
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:31,164
-You can watch love-struck Lauren.
-You're right.

105
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,333
If it doesn't work out
you can go save her.

106
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,294
That's true. One ticket to Hawaii please.

107
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,089
You're selling yourself so cheap.

108
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,375
-It's so pretty!
-It is.

109
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,210
Everyone seems so happy.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,153
Excuse me. Hi!

111
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,156
-Wow.
-Amazing!

112
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,616
-Thanks for coming.
-Wow!

113
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,411
-Thank you.
-Amazing!

114
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,372
-Lauren!
-Thank you!

115
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,917
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

116
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,919
-This is amazing.
-Thank you.

117
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,382
This is amazing.

118
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,301
-Oh, thank you.
-Congratulations.

119
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,511
Thank you Guy. Thank you.

120
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,263
-Wow.
-This is amazing.

121
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,182
-Thanks.
-You have so many.

122
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,517
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

123
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,519
She drew this with the pencil I gave her.

124
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,231
The bottom right.

125
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,485
-Really?
-Yes, all with Guy's pencil.

126
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,487
-Does this piece have a title?
-This one?

127
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,199
Oh, no, that's just random.

128
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,701
The exhibit is called 18, right?

129
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,205
Yeah, the exhibit title is 18.

130
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,375
You came up with all this on your own?

131
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,294
-It's amazing.
-Thank you.

132
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,382
What does it feel like to share...

133
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,635
your art with so many people?

134
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,139
It's like having strangers read my diary.

135
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,765
Oh, it's like a diary.

136
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,809
-So it's really embarrassing.
-That's embarrassing.

137
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,396
It's really embarrassing. I'm so nervous.

138
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,148
Last time I was like this.

139
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,735
Nice.

140
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,322
I think anyone who sees this
would think it's amazing.

141
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,532
-Really?
-Yes.

142
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,119
I thought there would be a specific theme,
but the works are all different.

143
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,080
I don't have a set style.

144
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,417
-I just draw what I like.
-Nice.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,709
Thank you.

146
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,629
Amazing.

147
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,758
I like that one.

148
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,970
-Does it have a title?
-I do have a title for it.

149
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,474
-Oh, you're writing it now?
-Yes, I'll put it up later.

150
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,562
Are you nervous?

151
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,607
-You're so nervous!
-I'm okay.

152
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,860
Nice.

153
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,364
-You're selling those over there?
-Yes.

154
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,533
This one...

155
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,743
or this one.

156
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,424
Thank you so much.

157
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,468
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay.

158
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,427
With you in it.

159
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,349
One more.

160
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,186
Thank you.

161
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,106
Thanks for buying that Taishi.

162
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,317
-Are you going to sign it? Oh, you did?
-It's already signed there.

163
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,948
-You must be relieved.
-It's finally done.

164
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,536
-How do you feel?
-How do I feel?

165
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,956
-I want to work hard on the next one.
-The next exhibit?

166
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,876
-Yes, the next exhibit.
-Is the next one set already?

167
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,214
I'm motivated to work hard
on my next art project.

168
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,048
-You are?
-I am.

169
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,592
Nice.

170
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,678
-Did you make a lot of sales?
-Not too many originals.

171
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,224
-You couldn't sell the originals?
-I sold two.

172
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,103
-Oh, you sold two?
-You mean the ones in the back?

173
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,022
-Yeah.
-You sold two? That's amazing!

174
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,191
-Really?
-That's amazing.

175
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,154
Do you have a plan for your next one?

176
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,533
I have a meeting with a gallery in Tokyo.

177
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,576
Oh, wow.
A show in Tokyo?

178
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,164
-I don't know yet, but I hope so.
-Oh, you might.

179
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,668
Oh, I have a day off next Monday.

180
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,836
-Really?
-For what?

181
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,630
In English, it's "Coming of Age Day."

182
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,716
Oh, the one in Japan?

183
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,054
On January 6th,
I'm going home for Coming of Age Day.

184
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,514
-You are?
-This year?

185
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,557
The 6th is soon.

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,933
-Yeah, on the 6th.
-Wait.

187
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,227
-How long are you going for?
-Four days.

188
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,605
What are everyone's goals for 2017?

189
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,607
-Did you think about it?
-Oh, right.

190
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,901
-I haven't thought about it.
-I haven't yet.

191
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,779
I want to have an exhibit in Tokyo,

192
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:59,367
and I want to work on my modeling.

193
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,453
And one more thing.

194
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,663
If I find someone I like...

195
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,791
I want a boyfriend.

196
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,252
Finally.

197
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,047
Nice.

198
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,237
LAUREN TSAI, 18 YEARS OLD

203

TAISHI TAMAKI, 29 YEARS OLD
ACTOR

204
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,680
None of the boys are here.

205
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,226
-Can I ask you a personal question?
-What?

206
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,187
What is it?

207
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,442
-What we talked about--
-Did you enjoy your date with Taishi?

208
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,529
The one you went on earlier.

209
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,697
-Earlier--
-Did you two go out after that?

210
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,198
Oh, you haven't.

211
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,992
I had fun.

212
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,706
-I was just wondering.
-Was that a personal question?

213
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,250
I guess it wasn't that personal.

214
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,753
We did go to lunch together the first day.

215
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,130
But it was right after we both moved in.

216
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,635
I didn't really know anything.

217
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,305
But Lauren and Taishi went out
the next day.

218
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,682
-To lunch you mean?
-Yeah.

219
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
Did you have fun, Lauren?

220
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,523
-It was pretty fun.
-Pretty fun?

221
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,275
Did you feel anything?

222
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,486
What do you mean?

223
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,405
You know...

224
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,909
Did you feel like you connected?

225
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,411
Like you're a good match?

226
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,873
-I have fun with him. I can be myself.
-Good night.

227
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,335
-You're going to bed?
-I'm going to take a bath.

228
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,045
-Good night.
-Good night.

229
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,465
If he asked you out again, would you go?

230
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,134
I probably would.

231
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,721
That's vague.

232
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,434
I'd totally go, of course.
Just like I would with you or Guy.

233
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,770
-The four of us did go surfing.
-Right.

234
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,939
We should go when you have time.

235
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,149
-We should go get lunch.
-Sure.

236
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,944
-I have a lot of questions for you.
-Seriously?

237
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,947
-I'll save them.
-What do you want to ask?

238
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,536
What do you want?
What are you doing with Avian?

239
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,872
Yeah.

240
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,584
Since we live together,
I can't help but wonder.

241
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,086
I can talk about that.

242
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,467
-I've actually been thinking about that.
-Oh, yeah?

243
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,763
-The exhibit was cute.
-It was.

244
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,765
-Amazing.
-Wasn't there a lot of dark art?

245
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,475
What was the puffy thing?

246
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,935
There was a round penis
chasing a salaryman.

247
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,604
It wasn't a penis.

248
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,149
My daughter is watching this.

249
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,402
A round cat then.

250
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,696
-Why are you calling it that?
-It's not a round cat.

251
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,324
Taishi's behavior at the exhibit
was impressive.

252
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,370
At the beginning, with Lauren and Taishi,

253
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,956
while Taishi's looking at the art,
her eyes go from Taishi to the art.

254
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,544
-That was nice wasn't it?
-It was cute.

255
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:43,090
She really turned into
your stereotypical love-struck girl.

256
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,135
She is 18, after all.

257
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,181
She declared later
that she wants a boyfriend.

258
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,474
In front of everyone.

259
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,476
-She never said that before.
-Not at all.

260
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,103
The guys who left the house
must not have been her type.

261
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,522
That's not important.

262
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,775
It can't be helped.
It's sad, but looks matter.

263
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,445
It's not just about looks!

264
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,488
With Taishi, it's not about looks.

265
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,700
-It's not?
-We're all worked up.

266
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,203
-It's not the looks.
-Yes, you have a sad sense of values.

267
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,415
Right, Saito?

268
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,292
It's how experienced Taishi seems.

269
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,128
He's a natural gentleman.

270
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:26,008
-Every move he makes seems to affect her.
-Yeah, it does.

271
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,928
-The way he touched her...
-It was very subtle.

272
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,263
The way he touched her...

273
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:37,729
At that point,
Taishi already knows it'll have an effect.

274
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,232
Well, he knows, but...

275
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,527
I don't think it's like that.

276
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,405
-It's like, "It's okay, Torichan."
-It's just like that.

277
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,826
But for Lauren, it has a big effect.

278
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,706
I don't think
he's playing games with her or anything.

279
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,417
You don't think so?
He's doing it nonchalantly,

280
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,004
but I think he knows
her body is responding.

281
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,425
Hey, that description might be
a little much.

282
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,764
If she's already in love with him...

283
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,602
-Just from this one touch, see?
-Tokui!

284
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,646
-See, just from this.
-Tokui!

285
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,609
Children and teenagers
watch this show, too.

286
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,069
-She's love-struck.
-Her heart skips a beat.

287
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,572
She's sensitized to his touch
because she likes him.

288
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,324
Everything he says and does--

289
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:39,165
So a guy can tell if a girl is into him
when he's with her?

290
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,585
I think Taishi would know.

291
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,713
To be honest, you know and you enjoy it.

292
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,175
-What? Is this Saito's experience?
-Is this your experience?

293
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,845
-You're on Taishi's side?
-It's like, "Oh, this girl likes me."

294
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,515
You see yourself as a popular guy.

295
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,100
To be honest, I've had that experience.
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,020
So you knew then that your actions
affected the girl?

297
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,607
Yes, and then I'd think,
"It's just as I thought."

298
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,361
Wait, is this back when you had hair?

299
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,323
Yes, but I experienced more
after I lost my hair.

300
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,952
-Wow.
-It comes from confidence.

301
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,955
And on top of that,
you have skills, right?

302
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,792
So, you're perfect then. Amazing.

303
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,335
-Amazing.
-It's not about looks.

304
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,880
-Lauren was really floundering.
-She was. It was cute.

305
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,049
She was flailing.

306
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,844
She was at her limit.
"Oh, no. He's going to know!

307
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,681
-Or maybe he knows already!"
-It's like a manga.

308
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,934
-She felt like everyone knew already.
-She's so cute.

309
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,567
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

310
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,822
I'm leaving for Tokyo on the 12th
for about a week.

311
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,990
-Really?
-Yeah.

312
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,409
But I have work on the 19th, so...

313
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:02,373
That job you got is only for one day?

314
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,251
-Yes, one day.
-What kind of job is it?

315
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,837
Well, it's for a perfume

316
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,759
for their catalog,
their website, social networks, and ads.

317
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,886
Three shoots for that.

318
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,721
Really? A perfume?

319
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,307
Yes, but it's a new brand,
so it's not famous at all.

320
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,726
That's amazing.

321
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,730
Yeah, I'm happy. It's my first big job.

322
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,442
-So I was going to rent an apartment.
-In Japan?

323
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,278
Yes, I was going to start looking.

324
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,989
I was thinking
I'd like to move to Tokyo this year.

325
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,117
Is that already decided?

326
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,621
I'm not sure how it'll turn out,
so during that week,

327
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,875
I'll go to the meetings with the gallery
in Tokyo and decide after that.

328
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,543
-Your future?
-Yeah, my future.

329
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:53,132
If I feel like life there is not for me,
then I'll go to college.

330
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,427
What are you going to do though?
If you're gone for a week...

331
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,972
-I wonder what'll happen.
-What'll happen with Taishi?

332
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,518
It's a whole week, Lauren.

333
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,814
Yeah, a week...

334
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,608
Yeah, I have no idea what to do.

335
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:16,113
-Do you talk to him?
-I was hoping he'd ask me out.

336
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,866
But he hasn't at all.

337
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,203
So maybe I'll ask him.

338
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,831
How do you want it to be?

339
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,834
Do you want it to be a casual date?

340
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,669
I think casual would be better.

341
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,546
I think it's fine
to ask him out in front of everyone.

342
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,465
Like, "Hey, do you wanna go out?"

343
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm sure Taishi is interested in Anna.

344
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,012
He is.

345
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,558
So if I ask, he'll be like,
"Wow, Lauren doesn't get it."

346
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,936
I don't think that's true.

347
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,522
I wonder how Anna feels.

348
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,485
Anna doesn't talk about it.

349
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,159
I don't know what to do.

350
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,912
But you don't really show...

351
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,291
your emotions to others.

352
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,503
-Yeah, I don't. I'm too scared.
-So, from a guy's point of view,

353
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,966
they might think you're not interested.

354
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,886
I've never...

355
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,514
asked a guy on a date before.

356
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,017
I've always been asked.

357
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,312
I think it'd be good
for you to take more initiative.

358
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,569
I'm going to ask him to play soccer.
We've been talking about it.

359
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,239
-You gave him the ball.
-Yeah.

360
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,826
When we are alone in the evening...

361
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,246
I'll ask him.

362
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,294
I'm full.

363
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,045
Thanks for the food.

364
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,839
Thanks for the food.

365
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,678
Thanks for the food.

366
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,407
I ate a lot.

367
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,329
-Oh, is that a video of you?
-Yeah.

368
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,455
I want to see.

369
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,084
Wow! Amazing!

370
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,169
That's impressive.

371
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,591
-That looks hard.
-Surfing?

372
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,927
The waves in Japan are small.

373
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,974
-What's this? Is it yours?
-It's Taishi's.

374
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,977
I liked it. It's like a checklist.

375
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,062
-What's this word?
-"Clearly."

376
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,439
"Clearly, in detail..."

377
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,359
-Can you read it?
-"Write it out."

378
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,111
"Set..."

379
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,407
-"A time limit."
-"For your goals."

380
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:10,412
-Are you teaching her?
-"If needed, more...

381
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:16,377
-"Detail."
-"...detail may be added."

382
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,130
-How are you learning kanji?
-Through LINE.

383
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,049
-LINE?
-When I chat with my friend,

384
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,343
I have to read kanji on LINE.

385
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,512
-You learn it just from LINE?
-Kind of.

386
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,597
-That's amazing.
-It's amazing.

387
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,349
What is this?

388
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:35,021
It's what I use as a guide
when I set goals.

389
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,023
It's a passage from a book.

390
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,360
-Why did you type it out?
-What?

391
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:46,157
-Why?
-I look at this when I write out goals.

392
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,368
-For my own goals.
-What kind of goals?

393
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,205
For example,
I have a goal to be in a Hollywood film.

394
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,209
So I'll set a time limit for myself
and I write a plan.

395
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,088
-Are you going surfing tomorrow?
-No, I have soccer.

396
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,715
Oh, right, soccer. I forgot.

397
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,217
What time?

398
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,346
-Soccer? 1:00 p.m.
-In the afternoon.

399
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,766
-Can you come?
-I want to play!

400
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,769
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

401
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,565
I'll go surf in the morning
and come back then.

402
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,652
Do you play in that field? I want to play.

403
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,780
But aren't you going to Japan tomorrow?

404
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,616
That's right. I can't go surfing.

405
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,453
I'm envious.

406
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:36,707
-The Coming of Age celebration sounds fun.
-I'll send a video.

407
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,600
Did it touch my nose?

408
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,393
You can have it.

409
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,479
-You don't want it?
-I'm okay.

410
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,772
That's an indirect kiss.

411
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,484
You made me pause.

412
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,779
-It did touch you, right?
-I don't mind.

413
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,117
She doesn't mind, so it's okay.

414
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,702
You have her permission.

415
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:15,871
That woke me up.

416
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,457
-Are you sleepy, Lauren?
-I am.

417
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,128
-I have to go to the store.
-You mentioned that.

418
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,588
-At this hour?
-Yeah.

419
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,797
Go, boss lady!

420
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,091
-I'm gonna go.
-See you.

421
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,385
-I'm going to change.
-Be careful.

422
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,971
-Good luck.
-Bye!

423
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,768
I think I'll go to sleep early today.

424
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,024
I'm going to retire.

425
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,691
Really?

426
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,329
-Anyone want water?
-Did Avian leave already?

427
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,417
I think she's changing. I'm not sure.

428
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,218
-Good night.
-Good night.

429
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,846
Are you relieved
now that the exhibit's over?

430
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,140
Yes.

431
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,975
How are things with you?

432
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,977
The surfing is going well.

433
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:25,857
But I want to keep up my motivation
in the long-term.

434
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,654
Everyone's working hard.
Taishi, too, with his...

435
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,782
-his plan for his goals.
-Oh, yeah, that.

436
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,284
That's really good.

437
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,286
Taishi is cool.

438
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,747
We spend a lot of time together.

439
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,794
-He's just really cool.
-Really?

440
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,882
He's funny.

441
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,054
Do you go to the beach?

442
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,683
Not really. I can't go too often.

443
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,644
-What about the mountains.
-Mountains?

444
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:07,649
-Sometimes, for hiking.
-Well, I'm always at the beach anyway.

445
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,153
-Do you want to go hiking?
-I love hiking.

446
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,406
-Do I want to? Oh, okay.
-If you want.

447
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,242
Okay, sure.

448
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,494
Yes! We get to go.

449
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,002
-I'm going to go to sleep.
-You are?

450
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,754
I'm tired today.

451
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,424
Then let's meet in the mountains.

452
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,967
Good night.

453
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,816
What time are you leaving?

454
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,819
-Soon.
-You are?

455
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,904
Then I'll go with you.

456
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:59,159
-Where would you live in Japan?
-In Tokyo.

457
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,121
The high is 12 degrees
and the low is two degrees.

458
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:06,375
-It's cold.
-Um, I don't know Celsius.

459
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,919
-It's cold.
-I'm American.

460
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,422
Do you have warm clothes?

461
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,675
-I do. I do.
-You do?

462
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:19,305
I'll buy some more, too. New stuff.
Ready to go?

463
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,597
-Yeah.
-I'm going, too.

464
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:25,394
-I'll go after I eat this.
-Oh, you're still eating.

465
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,315
-I'm running late, so I'll say bye now.
-Okay.

466
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,569
Ow.

467
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,238
-See you.
-See you.

468
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,199
Have fun in Japan!

469
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,617
-Keep in touch. Send us pictures.

470
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,578
-See you!
-See you!

471
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,332
-Have fun!
-Yeah.

472
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:55,382
I'll be in Japan for four days
for the Coming of Age celebration. -Guy

473
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,722
We went surfing the other day.

474
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,100
Taishi, Yuya, me and Anna.

475
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,186
And we went to eat after.

476
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,190
And during the meal...

477
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,150
Anna really questioned us.

478
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:17,488
Like, "Why aren't you guys exclusive?

479
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,325
Why don't you define your relationship?"

480
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,868
She really questioned us.

481
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,704
She put pressure on Yuya.

482
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,998
He answered all the questions.

483
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,917
I wonder why she cares so much.

484
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,171
Anna's lived here for a while now.

485
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,342
She's lived in Hawaii for a while now.

486
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:43,264
Why does it matter if we're
in a relationship or not?

487
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,100
Why does it matter to her so much?

488
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,396
Maybe because it's you and Yuya.

489
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,691
But why do we have to be questioned?

490
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:58,404
Well, Yuya's not mad, but...

491
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,071
You know, he's...

492
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,163
It's something
I eventually want to talk about with him.

493
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,041
What's he doing after Terrace House?

494
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,420
Going to Tokyo and then LA?

495
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,714
I don't know. He hasn't said anything.

496
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:22,177
Could you have
a long-distance relationship?

497
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,013
If there's a set time limit,
like a few months,

498
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,809
and we have a goal
of coming back together,

499
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,687
then I can do it.

500
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,567
But if there's no plan, then I can't.

501
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,153
If it's going to be a relationship,
it has to be serious.

502
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:44,700
I don't want it to just end after a month.

503
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,578
-But you're enjoying it now.
-I am.

504
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,332
I'm glad.
It seems like you guys are doing well.

505
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:56,503
I'm happy about that,
because I've seen it from the start.

506
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,340
That's right, since September.

507
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:03,427
It took some time,
but Yuya's really trying.

508
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,388
-We live together, so that's...
-Yeah, you live together,

509
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,098
so it's different from normal.

510
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,316
Sorry, but you look like a panda!

511
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,651
-Maybe, I can't see.
-Panda!

512
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,788
-It's so hot.
-That was a long bath.

513
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,708
It felt really good.

514
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,002
Really?

515
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,131
Want to come over here?

516
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,536
That's me.

517
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,430
Should I set it for 8:00?

518
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,349
-Can you get up with my alarm?
-Tomorrow...

519
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,227
-Do you hear the alarm?
-Yeah.

520
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,564
-You do?
-Yeah.

521
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,943
I'm hot!

522
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,198
You're hot? I'll take the covers.

523
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,491
It's okay.

524
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,090
It's so nice.

525
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,092
It's so nice!

526
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,470
It's the best time.

527
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:13,348
You're right, Tokui.

528
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,183
It's so...

529
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,519
The head...

530
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,981
He burrowed his nose in her hair.

531
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:27,488
-I don't know about "burrow."
-You do that when you really like someone.

532
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,908
People do that
when they really like someone.

533
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,911
Snuggling under a blanket on the sofa...

534
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,330
I want to snuggle, too!

535
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,250
I want to snuggle!

536
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,462
-I want to snuggle.
-It's nice.

537
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:48,091
-And as you snuggle...
-Yes, things are bound to happen.

538
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,469
Amazing. They're not even exclusive.

539
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,638
The two of them?

540
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:56,349
You keep commenting
like you're someone from the Meiji era.

541
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,602
-What?
-He's being a prude

542
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,647
about them acting lovey-dovey
before being in a relationship.

543
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,192
So for you, it's wrong to act like that
before you're in a relationship?

544
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,488
Otherwise, it's too convenient.

545
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,197
So if you have the exchange of...

546
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,618
"Let's go steady." "Yes, let's,"

547
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,621
then you can do anything?

548
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,917
But you can lie about that.
They're just words.

549
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,086
That's right. You don't understand.

550
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,299
-You see here...
-You re-positioned yourself.

551
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,926
You're like a high school teacher.

552
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,386
Like a math teacher.

553
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,056
What's important
is that they care for each other.

554
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,810
-That's what's important.
-Is this prep school?

555
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,395
And Guy asked Lauren out.

556
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,356
-What was that about?
-It's hard to say.

557
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,569
-He seemed interested in her.
-Maybe...

558
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:52,447
He communicated by silently
bringing a piece of fruit to her mouth.

559
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,825
That's like a zookeeper and a chimpanzee.

560
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,704
Like counting... One, two, three.

561
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,374
A smart chimpanzee...

562
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,169
And he can surf.

563
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,463
-Guy is so cute.
-He is.

564
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,007
He asked Lauren out and got a yes.

565
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,384
He said, "Yay, we get to go."

566
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,639
It means he was happy.

567
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:21,226
I know love can make you blind, but...

568
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,770
while he was saying "yay,"
she gave a big sigh.

569
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,399
She's young.

570
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,652
-It can't be helped.
-She's in love.

571
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,196
It might just be she was relieved.

572
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,990
At that moment?

573
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,326
He's a chimpanzee, so he didn't notice.

574
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,078
-He didn't?
-He didn't.

575
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,164
No, Guy was just like,
"Yay, we get to go hiking."

576
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,876
A walk with the zookeeper?

577
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,003
"Let's meet in the mountains."

578
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,922
"I'll be happy if there's honey."

579
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,465
"I'm going to eat it."

580
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,011
You imitate Guy
like he's missing six teeth.

581
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,972
We're just overflowing with love for him.

582
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,558
And we got a scene
with the two in the bath.

583
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:06,437
-That's right.
-It was cute. The girls' bath time.

584
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,856
It was scary.

585
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,277
Avian was bothered by Anna
questioning her relationship.

586
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,529
-Like, "Why does it matter to her?"
-Yeah.

587
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:19,034
It's amazing. Whenever anyone takes
an aggressive stance to her,

588
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,244
the way Avian reacts.

589
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,829
Isn't it really scary?

590
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,540
She's strong. She's very straightforward.

591
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,251
-Like she'll destroy anything that moves.
-It's scary.

592
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,421
But girls don't like
questions like that, right?

593
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,256
-That's right.
-We sure don't.

594
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,425
Like, "What right does she have
to say that?"

595
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,553
Also, maybe a part of Avian wants that,

596
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,723
but having someone else point it out
is frustrating.

597
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,016
-Bull's-eye.
-Yes.

598
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,770
"I understand Yuya's stance
and I was fine with it."

599
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,979
Yes, yes.

600
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,816
"What right does Anna have
to point that out?

601
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,444
Now that she's said it,
it's making me upset.

602
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,739
-And now I'm a little upset with Yuya."
-Ah, I see.

603
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,783
She was letting off steam.

604
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,870
I wonder what kind of talk
Yuya and Avian will have?

605
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,081
Will that situation become crazier?

606
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,834
It might just end there.

607
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,420
-Hey, Tokui!
-Tokui!

608
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,939
I haven't finished it.

609
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:36,527
-What's happening now?
-Right now? Um...

610
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:45,411
Riko and Terashima?

611
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,375
-This guy.
-Oh, that's right.

612
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,962
They just went on a yukata date.

613
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:02,178
-Did you watch all of it?
-Not all of it, but the interesting parts.

614
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,816
What do you think of holding hands
before dating someone exclusively?

615
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,863
I think anything is fine.

616
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,323
Do you like it when guys come onto you?

617
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:27,037
That's usually how it's been for me.

618
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,540
I'm not good at taking initiative.

619
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,335
Really? Yeah, it does seem
like they'd come to you.

620
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,378
A lot of them.

621
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,466
-I remember this scene. It's good.
-It's good?

622
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,094
-It's good from this point on.
-No way.

623
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,492
-I can't watch.
-It's scary.

624
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:10,205
I might have dreams about it.
Maybe a nightmare.

625
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,415
I'll save the rest for later.

626
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,752
How have you been lately?

627
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,214
Lately...

628
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,344
Lately, I've been preparing for Japan.

629
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,262
-You're busy?
-I finished the exhibit,

630
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,349
and now I'm preparing for Japan.

631
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,853
-How are things for you?
-Right now...

632
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,607
-Right now... well...
-What?

633
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:44,572
I'm thinking of asking Anna out on a date.

634
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,201
She's been all over Hawaii, though.

635
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,999
I feel like no matter where I take her,
she'll know more than me.

636
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,752
Well...

637
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:03,341
Anna seems like she'd like active things.

638
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,718
-Yeah.
-Something outdoorsy.

639
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,722
Right now I'm thinking of taking her...

640
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,642
horseback riding.

641
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,644
I think that would be good.

642
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,230
But...

643
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:21,442
-I'm nervous about asking her.
-Yeah, I'm sure you are.

644
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,820
Have you ever asked anyone out before?

645
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,323
Me? No.

646
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,616
-No?
-No.

647
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,118
You should.

648
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,038
It makes you nervous.

649
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,888
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

650
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,019
But...

651
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,939
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

652
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,902
You said your goal this year
was to find a boyfriend.

653
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,612
If I find someone I like.

654
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,032
Oh, you like guys with talent?

655
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,536
-He doesn't have to be talented.
-What kind of talent?

656
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,997
-What kind of talent?
-Anything specific?

657
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,542
No. Someone calm...

658
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,920
and cool.

659
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,424
-Someone calm and cool.
-Calm and cool, huh?

660
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:31,346
I think you set the bar high
for who you consider to be cool.

661
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,805
Not at all.

662
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,437
-Someone older then.
-Yes, I'd prefer older.

663
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,608
Everyone's out late today. I wonder why.

664
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,360
Yeah, they're out late.

665
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,404
Want to go somewhere?

666
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,241
Go somewhere? Now?

667
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,243
-Sure.
-Okay.

668
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,910
-Where?
-The park?

669
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,496
-The park?
-Yeah.

670
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,455
Okay, let's go.

671
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,290
-Okay.
-We can take a walk.

672
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,459
Let's take a walk then.

673
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,337
Do you mind if I go change?

674
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,008
-I'll go change, too.
-You will?

675
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,925
-It's cold.
-That's true.

676
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,427
It's been chilly lately.
