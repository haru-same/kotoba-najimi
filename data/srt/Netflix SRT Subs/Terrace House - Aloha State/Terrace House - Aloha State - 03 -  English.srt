1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:18,393
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together

3
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,312
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,816
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,944
There is no script at all.

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,574
I'm certain you've noticed
that Torichan is not here today.

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,826
She had a prior engagement?

8
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,538
She's absent today
because she's booked for an important job.

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,207
Is it at Numazu Theater?

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,710
Or at Makuhari Aeon Theater?

11
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,420
Are you suggesting Torichan is
a new comedian from Yoshimoto?

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,841
I'll review what happened last week
in Torichan's absence.

13
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:52,636
Pure Yusuke encountered
a problem last week.

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,888
That damn Yuya...

15
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,432
He mocked Yusuke's virginity.

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,603
You should try
going out with someone, Yusuke.

17
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,771
What about your ex?
Oh, right, you've never had one.

18
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,691
-You knew that already!
-You knew that already.

19
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,985
They are the same age, after all.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,196
So it's either friendly banter,
or he sees him in a lower caste.

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,490
Caste?

22
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:19,329
They used the pool for the first time,
and we saw Lauren in her bikini.

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,666
-Any scene could be used for a commercial.
-Yes, she's beautiful.

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,837
They asked Yusuke to join
so they could have background music.

25
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,929
It's like I'm working here.

26
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,807
Maybe it's because he was wearing
a Hawaiian shirt,

27
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,143
but it felt like he was working for them.

28
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,855
-That's true.
-But he'll be in Japan for three days

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,566
for the Hawaiian Music Awards Japan.

30
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,945
And Naomi and Eric,
the only members who drink,

31
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,030
drank together by the pool.

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,617
But Lauren and Eric
also have similar interests.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,369
-They shared artwork.
-Their designs.

34
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,204
Yes, and the café design.

35
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,708
And Lauren and Yuya went for a night run.

36
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,251
It's so pretty.

37
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,588
Do you like one of the guys right now?

38
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,216
If I took this part of Yusuke,

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,470
and took this part of Yuya,
and this part of Eric...

40
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,099
-If you combined them, it'd be perfect?
-Yeah, it'd be nice.

41
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:25,729
Lauren states that she wants someone
who has the best parts of all three guys.

42
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,614
Nice dive!

43
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,117
-I'm going to dive in, too.
-It was really nice.

44
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,203
It was beautiful.
The water didn't splash.

45
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,081
Okay, I'm filming.

46
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,836
-Nice.
-No good!

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,549
-So you decided to join.
-Let me sit here. I'm lonely.

48
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,927
Is that watch waterproof?

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,678
-It's waterproof.
-Really?

50
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,314
Can you swim?

51
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,649
Yeah... but I can't do the breaststroke.

52
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:15,362
-Can you surf?
-I've never surfed before.

53
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,489
You probably can if you tried.

54
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,449
You guys can teach me.

55
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,744
Want to go on Sunday?

56
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,246
-Sunday? Okay!
-Yeah.

57
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,625
What?

58
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,425
And then...

59
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,012
What would the response be?

60
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,264
-Here, I'll be the...
-Okay.

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,517
Yes, please.

62
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,705
In that case...

63
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,882
-Can I make the call?
-Yes.

64
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,700
I was so nervous. Thank you!

65
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,161
Don't worry about it.

66
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,246
Next is...

67
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,748
Eggs 'N Things.

68
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,416
-In Ala Moana?
-Yeah.

YUYA SHIBUSAWA, 18 YEARS OLD
ASPIRING ACTOR

LAST RELATIONSHIP: 6 MONTHS AGO

72
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,669
-That's amazing.
-Not at all.

73
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,089
You're drawing more and more.

74
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,216
-It's really amazing.
-Really?

75
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,012
I mean, it's not easy to have
so much character in your art.

76
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,974
Did you tell everyone about your job?

77
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,309
It's through Avian's connections.

78
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:01,356
So it's already kind of set,
but I'm going to have an interview.

79
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,732
-As a formality.
-Yeah.

80
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,234
That's great.

81
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,943
-At a restaurant?
-A restaurant.

82
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,239
-Go get 'em!
-I will, thanks.

83
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm getting sleepy.

84
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,452
-Isn't it early?
-It's early.

85
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,039
Yusuke's coming home any minute.

86
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,956
We have an early morning tomorrow.

87
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,001
-I can't wait!
-We're going surfing.

88
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,461
-Where are you going?
-Waikiki.

89
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,422
Oh, Waikiki.

90
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,258
She's a beginner,
so it'll be easier for her.

91
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,592
Thank you.

92
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,969
Avian can teach you.

93
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,721
You're not going to teach me?

94
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,474
-He doesn't want to do it!
-Teach me.

95
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,060
-Maybe he's not--
-He's back.

96
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,644
-I'm home.
-Yusuke.

97
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,479
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

98
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,773
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

99
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,109
-How are you guys?
-Really great.

100
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,319
I'm glad.

101
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,695
How was it?

102
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,615
-Well, I have this.
-What's that?

103
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,618
-Oh, you won something!
-Yes.

104
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,994
Amazing.

105
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,872
I won this special award.

106
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,834
Wow!

107
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,961
Let me see. Wow, amazing!

108
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,631
-I didn't win first place, but...
-Runner-up?

109
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,676
It was the special award
for making it to the finals.

110
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,303
Amazing!

111
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,309
-I won't touch it, but can I see it?
-Oh, go ahead.

112
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,394
What did you guys do while I was away?

113
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,189
While you were away?

114
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,523
We had a lot of fun.

115
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,985
-I knew you'd say that.
-Don't say that!

116
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,571
Lorraine and Yuya decided to go out.

117
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,281
We didn't!

118
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,659
-Yeah.
-I thought you were serious for a second.

119
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,121
They've been hanging out a lot together.

120
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,874
Neither one of them works,
so they're always together.

121
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,043
-We get along.
-Yeah.

122
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,213
She's easy to talk to.

123
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,883
Were there a lot of people present
when you performed?

124
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,094
More than I expected.

125
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,223
-Were you nervous?
-I wasn't.

126
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,057
-You weren't nervous?
-Did you make any mistakes?

127
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,309
None.

128
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,396
That was a great response.

129
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,980
-Your proud expression...
-That was good.

130
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,900
But everything else isn't good.
Not at all.

131
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,944
How insecure can you be?
Have some confidence.

132
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:17,074
I'm hoping to gain more confidence
in other areas.

133
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,451
-That's good.
-You will.

-It is.

-Where did you buy this?
-It was a gift.

142
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,219
It's a really nice board.

143
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,729
-The board's heavy! I'm gonna die.
-Nice.

144
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,606
You can use this one, too.

145
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,653
You put your foot forward.

146

-Like this?
-Yeah.

147
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,701
And then do this. Like this.

148
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,996
Make sure to bend your knees.

149
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,706
-Okay.
-I'll try.

150
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,224
Bon appétit!

151
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,521
-Brings me back to life.
-It's good, isn't it?

152
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,647
Totally brings me back to life.

153
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,024
Japanese cuisine is the best.

154
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,734
How did you like surfing?

155
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,405
-You want to do it again?
-My first surf.

156
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,740
-Should we go tomorrow?
-I was impressed by everyone.

157
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,741
What? That's too quick.

158
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,453
-Tomorrow morning.
-You want to go tomorrow?

159
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,413
-At 5:00 in the morning.
-I'll go.

160
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,876
It was your first time.
You're not up for tomorrow, right?

161
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,796
-Right?
-I'll take a break.

162
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,801
But surfing will make you healthy.

163
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,053
It's good for your body.

164
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,638
It's a nice lifestyle,

165
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:30,226
surfing with everyone in the morning
and then going to work.

166
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,937
-That's nice.
-And then go to school or whatnot.

167
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,524
It's nice to spend the weekend surfing
with everyone else.

168
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,651
Let's go hiking next time.

169
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,199
-I'm exhausted.
-Me, too.

170
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,620
5:00 a.m. tomorrow...
I'll make myself get up.

171
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,372
-You're going again?
-I am.

172
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,914
You should surf too, Yusuke.

173
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,958
I would if I had time.

174
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,210
Oh, you do want to?

175
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,507
Yeah, without these,
even though I'd be blind.

176
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,216
And Yusuke's a virgin.

177
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,803
That's true.
That came out of nowhere.

178
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,640
-I'm sure everyone knows already.
-You said it so suddenly.

179
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,934
I don't think that's unusual at 18.

180
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,145
-You think so?
-Yeah.

181
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,938
-You've still got time.
-I still have time?

182
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,940
Hopefully, at least once in my lifetime.

183
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,402
Only once in a lifetime?

184
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,612
-At least once.
-Wait, hold on.

185
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,865
-Welcome back.
-It's Lauren.

186
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,409
-What did you do?
-It's Lauren.

187
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:31,871
It was my sister's birthday,
so we went out for dinner.

188
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,457
-Was it fun?
-It was, and it was tasty.

189
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,126
-I'm going to sleep by 10:00 tonight.
-Me, too.

190
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,630
I have school tomorrow, too.
I have to get up early.

191
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,715
Same. I have work tomorrow.

192
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,801
-Where?
-Banán.

193
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,136
-Do you know Banán?
-It's a new place, right?

194
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,805
Yes, that's right.

195
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,931
-Banana soft-serve--
-Instagram...

196
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,016
Yeah, it's all over Instagram.

197
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,185
-We don't have plans, right?
-Yep, no plans.

198
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,980
-As usual.
-Yep, as usual.

199
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,983
-I'm going to go do some work.
-Okay.

200
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,777
-I'm going to draw.
-You're going to draw?

201
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,404
-Yeah.
-Okay.

202
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,281
See ya.

203
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,077
I'm going to get things ready for school.

204
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,919
We're the ones left behind again.

205
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,631
-The two of us, as usual.
-As usual.

206
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,469
-But we actually get along best.
-Yeah.

207
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,095
-We're always talking.
-Yeah.

208
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,639
We talk and hang out the most.

209
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,309
Yeah, we get along.

210
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,563
-You're easy to talk to.
-Thanks.

211
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,815
-Sure.
-Sure.

212
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,277
What should we do tomorrow?

213
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,571
What should we do?

214
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,074
Oh, we need groceries.
We're out of meat.

215
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,784
-We have to go shopping.
-Yeah, we finished it today.

216
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,995
Yeah, we need to go shopping sometime.

217
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,832
Then shouldn't we go tomorrow?
It takes forever when we all go.

218
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,462
I guess the two of us can do it.
We can just get what we'll definitely use.

219
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,590
Everyone will eat whatever we make anyway.

220
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,967
Let's just go grocery shopping somewhere.

221
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,720
-Should we?
-Yeah.

222
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,346
They went surfing...

223
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,725
But...

224
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,478
-It was a little...
-A little awkward.

225
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,898
Yeah, when the four of them were eating,

226
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,316
they were saying,
"Let's do it again tomorrow,"

227
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,610
and asked Naomi what she thought.

228
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,989
And her response was telling.
She said, "I was impressed by everyone."

229
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,659
-She did.
-She didn't say she had fun.

230
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,036
She said they seemed to have fun.

231
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,079
He's stupid and kept eating the rice ball.

232
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,582
That's harsh.

233
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,836
But Eric didn't notice
that Naomi was a little down either.

234
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,506
Eric is really just an old man.

235
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,760
His useless comment
that he's going to sleep at 10:00...

236
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,429
-A useless announcement.
-It's like, "So?"

237
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,515
It's something your dad would say.

238
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,809
"Daddy's going to sleep at 10:00 tonight."

239
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,477
-Who cares?
-And the whole family ignores him.

240
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,023
-Yeah, it's like, "Who cares?"
-"Go ahead."

241
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,734
Oh, we can't forget, Yusuke's back.

242
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,612
-He won the special award.
-Amazing.

243
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:14,241
The way Lauren gazes at Yusuke,
and the things she says to him...

244
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,955
It makes you wonder if the respect
will turn into love someday.

245
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,794
Lauren's eyes are so beautiful that...

246
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,921
Even when she's looking at you normally,

247
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,883
it makes you think
there's meaning behind her gaze.

248
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,680
And Yusuke has no experience with women.
He's a pure boy.

249
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,182
And whenever he's sitting on the floor,

250
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,935
-Lauren's hips are at eye level.
-That's right.

251
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,478
In a pair of shorts.

252
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,938
I wouldn't be able to stand it.

253
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,650
To have someone that beautiful in shorts
walk in front of a virgin...

254
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,276
That's a huge ordeal.

255
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,822
Even if it's only to lose his virginity...

256
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,782
I wonder if Lauren will help.

257
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,201
That would make for the best season!

258
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,747
Lauren can sit
with the ukulele beside her...

259
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,333
and say,
"Which do you want to play tonight?"

260
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,754
You're impossible. Just impossible.

261
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,976
I'm running late.

262
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,310
-For work?
-Yeah.

263
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,647
You don't have to eat.
I'll wrap it up for you.

264
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,106
-No, I want some.
-You'll have some?

265
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,984
Oh, then here's one that's ready.

266
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,527
-Can I eat it?
-Yeah.

267
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,531
-Do you really have time to eat?
-No, but I'm hungry.

268
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,742
-I'm digging in.
-Go ahead.

269
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,578
Thanks! You saved me.

270
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,706
Were the waves good?

271
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,793
It was really windy today.

272
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,631
-It was like a storm.
-Oh, so it was dangerous?

273
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,257
-No, it was fun.
-Was it?

274
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,717
I caught a few waves.

275
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,261
-All right.
-Okay.

276
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,930
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

277
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,641
Thanks for eating it
even though you have to rush.

278
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,475
-It was delicious.
-Thanks.

279
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,395
-Work hard.
-Thanks.

280
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,397
-Bye!
-I'm off.

281
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,149
So for three more...

282
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,485
Looks good.

283
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,614
-I feel good.
-Avian's not up yet.

284
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,117
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

285
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,788
I'm so sleepy.
I'm going back to sleep after this.

286
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,247
-You're going to sleep?
-Yeah.

287
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:30,461
So if we just go shopping today,
we're going to have a lot of free time.

288
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,880
We'll be bored.
Wanna go to the beach?

289
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,925
Sure, let's go.

290
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,344
There's a beach with a beautiful view.

291
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,138
It's about an hour from here.

292
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,724
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

293
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,728
If we go to the beach, then go shopping,
then come back, it'll be perfect.

294
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,563
We can make dinner
when everyone comes home.

295
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,065
Are we going to swim?

296
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,984
What? No.

297
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,360
-We're just going to see it?
-Yeah.

298
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,903
Okay, I want to go.

299
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,158
Thanks for the food.

300
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,247
-I'm going to sleep for a bit.
-Sure.

301
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,500
Can you wake me up around 12:30
if I'm not already up?

302
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,793
12:30?

303
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,795
-Sleep well.
-Thanks again for the food!

304
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,256
See you later.

305
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,717
Are you nervous?

306
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,179
-You're nervous?
-Yeah.

307
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,349
You need to understand girls.

308
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,017
-Because this is a date?
-Of course I am.

309
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,228
And I dressed for a date today.

310
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,938
-I noticed that.
-Right?

311
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,190
Yeah, you're dressed for a date.

312
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,735
-Insane. It's already so beautiful.
-Right?

313
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,571
-I wonder which beach it is. It's so nice.
-It's so beautiful.

314
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,408
I wanna go in.
I should've brought my swimsuit.

315
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,577
-Did you bring yours?
-No.

316
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,162
-You didn't?
-No.

317
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,044
So pretty.

318
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,921
Hold on...

319
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,841
-It's better than I imagined.
-It's so beautiful.

320
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,093
-It's insane!
-It's so beautiful.

321
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,598
It's cold.

322
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,475
It's nice here, isn't it?

323
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,685
It was worth the drive.

324
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,648
-It's super nice.
-It's beautiful. The water is so blue.

325
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,276
-It's insane.
-The waves this morning were brown.

326
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,945
It's insane how beautiful it is.

327
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,870
-You should talk to Yusuke more.
-Why?

328
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,831
Since Yusuke went to Japan...

329
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,667
he feels like he missed out.

330
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,962
I think he's anxious about it.

331
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,838
-About what?
-That he's sort of missed out.

332
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,174
I think it bothers him.

333
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,677
-So will you talk with him more?
-Okay.

334
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,014
One of the reasons you wanted
to stay at Terrace House

335
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,934
was to learn English, right?

336
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,686
-Are there any other reasons?
-No.

337
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,438
-Nothing? That's it?
-Yeah.

338
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,357
All I want is to study English
and become an actor.

339
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,986
-Why do you ask?
-No reason.

340
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,487
-I just wanted to ask.
-What was yours?

341
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,074
Mine? Pretty similar I guess.

342
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,201
-I want to practice English.
-Refresh your English.

343
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,786
It'll be quick once you start working.

344
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,621
-When do you start? The fifth?
-You think?

345
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,125
My interview is on the fifth,
and I'll find out then when I'll start.

346
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,048
-All right, should we head out?
-You want to go?

347
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,507
-I've had enough.
-Bored of it?

348
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,259
For a while now.

349
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,180
-Okay then.
-You sound unsatisfied.

350
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,516
-Let's stay until you're satisfied.
-We came all the way here.

351
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,186
Should we go?

352
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,355
-Should we?
-Okay.

353
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,772
I want to nap here.

354
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,109
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

355
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,610
-With a blanket laid out.
-Yeah.

356
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,530
Remember how I said
I like picnics for first dates?

357
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,032
-That's right.
-I love it.

358
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,492
But this isn't a date.

359
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,122
-What is it, then?
-We're hanging out.

360
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,456
Just killing time.

361
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,835
Did you want it to be a date?

362
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,505
I don't know.
I just didn't know what this was.

363
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,678
-That's a really nice place.
-It was so beautiful.

364
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,097
Did anything happen?

365
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,349
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

366
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,184
No deep conversations?

367
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:40,979
-No deep talks.
-So Yuya is... done?

368
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,315
Done? What do you mean?

369
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,276
-I mean...
-Yeah, what do you mean?

370
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,943
So nothing is ever going to happen?

371
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,987
I don't think so.

372
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,241
-No?
-The setting was nice.

373
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,369
-Romantic?
-Yeah.

374
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,794
How was your day?
You had work, right?

375
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:08,090
Yeah, it was my first day at my new job.

376
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,633
It was fun.

377
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,093
Was it busy?

378
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,181
-Peel the skin.
-That's what I did.

379
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,225
Probably about 2,000 of them.

380
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,311
-The whole time.
-That many?

381
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,938
It was so much fun. I loved it.

382
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,234
I can think while I do it.

383
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:31,197
-Does that make sense?
-You were imagining things as you did it,

384
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,157
because you're only peeling.

385
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,952
You should draw a banana next.

386
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,538
-I will.
-Yeah, you should.

387
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,373
When you went...

388
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,377
surfing with Eric, Yuya and Avian,
how was that?

389
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,839
-Oh, you didn't hear?
-I don't think so.

390
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,965
-Really?
-That's right.

391
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,384
I was a mess.

392
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,721
-But Avian stuck with me the whole time.
-Really?

393
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,682
Eric and Yuya went off somewhere.

394
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:02,269
I thought Eric was going to teach you.

395
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,272
He showed me how to get onto a board
on the beach.

396
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:10,068
I thought he'd teach me in the water,
but he was already far away.

397
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,364
-Isn't that a little... bad?
-Yeah.

398
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,200
The guys were selfish.

399
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:20,287
They went off on their own
and left Naomi with me.

400
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,831
-Yeah.
-They should've waited for you.

401
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,541
-It's not too much to ask.
-Right?

402
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,086
The boys were so selfish.

403
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,798
I'm sorry, but I'm just going to say it.
It's unacceptable.

404
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,386
-They weren't gentlemen.
-I didn't want to mention this.

405
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:40,599
The night before you went surfing...

406
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,603
Eric said, "It would be better
if Naomi weren't coming."

407
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:49,650
-Really?
-Yeah. He asked me to help him.

408
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,695
-Why?
-He asked I do something else with you.

409
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,447
Like he didn't want her to come?

410
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,867
He said it wouldn't be fun.

411
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,202
I see.

412
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,497
That's really terrible of him.

413
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,790
I see.

414
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,627
Like, he didn't want to look after her?

415
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,672
I think he didn't want to teach you.

416
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,757
Like he...

417
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,218
Wanted to enjoy it himself.

418
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,096
We all went to have fun.

419
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,474
I wish he didn't say things like that.

420
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,604
That's right.

421
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,106
Maybe that's why he doesn't have one.

422
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,988
Thanks for telling me.
I'm glad you did.

423
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,574
I didn't want to, but...

424
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,742
I was so mad.
I thought it's better to tell you.

425
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,536
-Thank you.
-It's better you know.

426
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,834
I see him differently
now that I know he sees me as a burden.

427
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,546
-There it is.
-It's all over!

428
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,216
-The first crisis.
-The first problem.

429
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,051
That was really mean of Eric. The worst.

430
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,763
It's not what the oldest person
should say or do.

431
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,475
Those aren't the actions of a 27-year-old.

432
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,435
No wonder
he's not popular with the ladies.

433
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,437
They said that, too.

434
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,190
You know it's over when they say,
"That's why you don't have a girlfriend."

435
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,318
Yuya, too.

436
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,780
-He's not being shy, right?
-No, that's not it at all.

437
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,243
Who says he's bored when he's with a girl?

438
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,160
"What? I'm killing time."

439
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,997
-That's right.
-Who says that?

440
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,916
Even if it's not a date,
there's no need to say that.

441
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,878
Yeah, he could've just said
it's a nice way to spend time.

442
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,922
Like, "I wanted to bring you here
because it's pretty."

443
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,549
Yeah, like, "I'm glad we got to see it."

444
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,885
Yusuke might become popular.

445
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,679
There could be a foursome.

446
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,390
Foursome?

447
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,308
That would be a first!

448
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,228
The four of them could peel a banana.

449
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,607
Peel Yusuke's banana?

450
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,692
Okay, it's bad when Torichan's not here.

451
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,611
It's bad.

452
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,321
-I realize how important Torichan is.
-Seriously.

453
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,615
-I'm sorry.
-When Lauren was peeling bananas,

454
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:06,328
Kentaro and I were wondering
why they're peeling bananas.

455
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,581
We were about to say something,
but Yu was like, "Stop that!"

456
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,377
Because her co-worker asked,

457
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,047
"What are we going to do
with all these bananas?"

458
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,132
I thought, "Are you serious?"

459
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,929
-That's not normal.
-I mean, what would you do with bananas?

460
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,433
They're soft and mushy.

461
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,436
Your description is perverse, too!

462
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,020
You can freeze them.

463
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,772
Torichan!

464
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,149
-Torichan!
-Come back!

465
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,986
-Is this for your job interview?
-Yeah.

466
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,156
You have to do it online, I guess.

467
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,659
Are you doing okay?

468
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,829
Not at all.

469
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,290
-Oh, I thought you'd say you're fine.
-No.

470
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,460
I didn't know you had to do this.

471
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,837
I can't even enjoy this Coke.

472
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,256
-You have to work.
-Yeah, I'm in trouble.

473
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,759
-You can't log in?
-Hold on...

474
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,387
-I'm sure I made one earlier.
-It's so long.

475
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,597
Yeah.

476
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,682
Oh, I have to change keyboards.

477
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,058
I'm going to sleep.

478
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,312
I won't be able to get up at 5:00
if I don't go now.

479
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,815
Yeah, I'll go to sleep in an hour.

480
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,442
-Good night.
-Good night.

481
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,026
-Good night.
-Good night.

482
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:26,157
-Everyone who works there has an account?
-I think...
