1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:18,435
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,103
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,690
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,276
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,112
-Welcome back.
-Thanks for having me.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,616
Saito understands
the male mentality very well.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,493
-And can share his experiences.
-I'm just grateful.

9
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,789
I never expected to fit in so well here...

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,584
-In this show.
-Yes, he does fit in.

11
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,671
We think that Saito's favorite, Lauren,

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,049
-will take some action this week.
-She will.

13
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,550
She'll make a move.

14
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,221
There's been a lot leading up to it.

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,724
Lauren's heart was pounding all last week.

16
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,435
Are you nervous?

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,397
-You're so nervous!
-I'm okay.

18
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,817
As an excuse to ask him out,

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,487
she was holding the soccer ball
she had given him.

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,074
She tried, but she couldn't ask him
if he wanted to play soccer with her.

21
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,285
-She was the picture of lovesick.
-She was cute.

22
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,537
She threw aside the soccer ball.

23
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,373
-That was a good scene.
-Yes, it was.

24
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,501
She hoped to tell him how she felt
over a game of soccer,

25
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,419
so she kept the ball near her stomach.

26
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,797
-She was warming it up.
-Yes, warming it up,

27
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,842
hoping that romance might bloom.

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,720
But she threw it aside
when it wasn't possible.

29
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:39,767
And Guy asked Lauren out,
though we don't know if he's serious yet.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,770
It was sudden.
He asked her out of the blue.

31
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,232
-Do you want to go hiking?
-I love hiking.

32
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,984
-Do I want to? Sure.
-If you want.

33
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,112
-Okay.
-Yes! We get to go.

34
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,741
-It's not clear yet how he feels.
-No, it's not clear.

35
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,493
Anna invited Yuya to lunch.

36
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,871
There's no deeper meaning to that.

37
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,873
-She just has questions.
-That's right.

38
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,792
Even though it doesn't mean anything,

39
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,502
if Avian finds out
and reads more into it...

40
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,297
-A misunderstanding.
-I hope there's a misunderstanding

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,507
and they clash.

42
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,639
-Let's be honest. Avian doesn't like Anna.
-That's right.

43
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,891
The way she talked...

44
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,643
-It's complicated.
-Things soured.

45
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,813
And Lauren, from her actions last week...

46
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,606
Though it's certain
he doesn't feel the same way,

47
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,275
she still asked him to go out.

48
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,528
This means she must have decided
to take action this week.

49
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,780
That's right.

50
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,908
-How are things for you?
-Right now...

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,162
-Right now... Well...
-What?

52
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,667
I'm thinking of asking Anna out on a date.

53
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,752
Everyone's out late today. I wonder why.

54
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,212
Want to go somewhere?

55
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,465
-Go somewhere?
-Sure.

56
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,925
-Where?
-The park?

57
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,426
-The park?
-Yeah.

58
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,764
Taishi's plan to ask Anna out
put pressure on Lauren until finally,

59
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,058
-it lit a fire under her.
-Oh, I see.

60
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,268
And so she asks, "Want to go somewhere?"

61
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,063
Otherwise, even that
would've been hard for her.

62
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,648
-That may be true.
-So they'll go to the park.

63
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:16,405
She'll ask, "Do you know what you'll
talk about on your date?

64
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:20,033
-Do you want to practice with me?"
-There it is!

65
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,536
"Tell her how you feel."
Then she'll make him say, "I like you,"

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,955
and she'll say, "Me, too."

67
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,250
She can mix her true feelings
into the acting.

68
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,377
-She's not that skilled.
-So dramatic!

69
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,837
So dramatic!

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,798
If Seina was here she'd do it!

71
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,425
That may be too much
of a challenge for Lauren.

72
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,428
This feels like something
Tomoko Yamaguchi would do.

73
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,222
-Nice.
-In my head, it's like...

74
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,474
"Why don't you give it a try?

75
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,436
-That's not going to impress Anna."
-Yes.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,604
"Get it right.

77
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,858
Try it again."

78
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,360
That's no longer Lauren,
but Tomoko Yamaguchi.

79
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,327
-This park is called Waialae-Iki.
-Waialae-Iki.

80
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,842
Thanks again for the soccer ball.

81
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,094
-I was so happy.
-I'm glad.

82
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,971
I was gonna get one myself.

83
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,890
This is unusual for you...

84
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,726
for you to say you want to go somewhere.

85
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,773
-Yeah, I've been so busy lately.
-Yeah.

86
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,566
What's that? Oh, a cookie.

87
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,779
-I've been so busy lately.
-That's right.

88
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,322
The exhibit was really good.

89
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,032
-Really?
-Yeah.

90
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm glad.

91
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,744
Thank you.

92
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,831
-Nice.
-I will work hard.

93
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,457
-Yeah.
-I'll do my best.

94
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,543
-You want to do an exhibit in Japan, too.
-I do.

95
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:58,090
I want to open myself more to everyone.

96
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,342
-So I'll work harder.
-Nice.

97
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,136
I want to reveal more of myself.

98
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,267
The more I get to know you,
the more I understand your art.

99
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,985
Once I know what's behind the art,

100
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,947
then I form an attachment to it.

101
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,199
That's why I wanted the painting.

102
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,870
Because I know it's your art,
I wanted to buy it.

103
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,330
-Thank you.
-It was really good,

104
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,500
but I also know the background,

105
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,294
and that you worked really hard on it.

106
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,882
Seeing that makes the art...

107
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,094
makes it more special
than other art sold out there.

108
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,390
-Thank you. Thank you.
-That's how I felt.

109
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,103
-I'll put the piece up in LA.
-Thank you! That makes me happy.

110
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,646
-Send me pictures.
-I will.

111
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,900
I'll show off saying,
"My friend drew this."

112
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,028
-Nice.
-I'm glad.

113
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,614
Swings.

114
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,449
-You want to go on the swings?
-Yeah.

115
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,788
Swings, huh?

116
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,629
It's been a while
since I've been on one.

117
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,174
-Really?
-Yeah, a very long time.

118
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,716
Have fun.

119
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,722
This brings back memories.

120
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,559
Yes, it does.

121
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,978
It's a little scary.

122
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,813
Nice.

123
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,068
Did you ever go to Japan
when you were younger?

124
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,820
-No.
-Not at all?

125
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,949
-I went once with my family.
-Oh, with your family.

126
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,783
But it was only for three days.

127
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,494
-And you liked it there?
-I did.

128
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,004
Wait, wait. I can't see! It's too dark.

129
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,214
You can see.

130
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,424
-Whoa! I can't see.
-See?

131
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,345
Are you okay? Cold?

132
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,389
I'm okay. It's cold, but I'm okay.

133
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,516
-I'm always cold.
-You are?

134
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,230
-Should we head back?
-Should we?

135
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,066
Let's talk more often. It was fun today.

136
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,151
Thank you for asking me out.

137
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,990
-Shall we go?
-Okay, let's go.

138
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,287
You're too good. It scares me.

139
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,789
-What? Why?
-It's scary.

140
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,461
-You're good.
-I'm not.

-Welcome back.

148
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,068
Is it just you, Taishi?

149
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,612
-It's just me.
-Everyone's been so busy lately.

150
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,781
-Everyone comes home late.
-Right?

151
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,743
-How's the job hunt?
-Have you heard of Arancino?

152
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,911
You've mentioned it.

153
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,707
-I really hope I get it. I want to work.
-You haven't had an interview yet?

154
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,834
-No.
-You said you had one before?

155
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,379
-Somewhere you applied...
-I've applied to a lot of places, but no.

156
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,798
-No calls?
-There have been no calls.

157
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,844
-Arancino's nice.
-I've also asked Avian for help.

158
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,097
If she knows of good places...

159
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,726
When are you off next?

160
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,936
-I'm usually off.
-No way.

161
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,271
Let's go on a date.

162
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,772
-A date?
-A date.

163
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,900
-A date?
-A date.

164
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,236
Sure. Let's go.

165
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,155
I've been wanting to go horseback riding.

166
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,992
-Let's go.
-I want to go horseback riding.

167
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,661
Where can we go in Hawaii?

168
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,624
On the map...

169
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,419
-Turtle Bay or Kualoa Ranch?
-That one!

170
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,589
-Kualoa Ranch?
-I think that's what I was looking at.

171
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,548
Nice.

172
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,843
-What do you want to do for lunch?
-That day?

173
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,180
-You pick.
-Well, I...

174
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,642
I want... What's it called?
It's in a square box...

175
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,811
and it's really good
when two people eat it.

176
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,896
What?

177
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,983
-I have no idea what you mean.
-I want a bento lunch.

178
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,320
-A homemade bento lunch.
-Wait, wait...

179
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,698
A bento lunch? Nice.

180
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,075
-I don't care what's inside.
-Okay, got it.

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,829
-I can eat anything.
-I've never made a bento lunch before.

182
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,541
Good. It'll be your first.

183
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,505
-I'll give you details later.
-Good night. Let me know.

184
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,007
It'll probably be next week.

185
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,428
-Next week.
-Yeah, that'll be good.

186
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,930
-Do you need time?
-I need time to prepare.

187
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,059
Sure, you can cook wearing an apron.

188
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,145
I do want an apron, actually.

189
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,439
-I'll buy you an apron then.
-Really?

190
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,107
-I'll go buy one.
-I'm looking forward to it.

191
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,985
-What kind do you like?
-Whatever you prefer.

192
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,862
My preference might be too extreme.

193
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,574
Well, that makes things
more exciting actually.

194
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,910
-I'll think about the apron.
-Thank you.

195
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,953
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

196
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,413
-Good night.
-Good night.

197
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,345
-Yuya.
-Hey.

198
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,388
There?

199
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,058
-Did you just finish class?
-Yeah, around 12:30 pm.

200
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,355
-Bon appétit.
-Take some cilantro if you want.

201
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,023
I wanted to ask you
what was going on with Avian,

202
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,694
what your plans with her are.

203
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,322
I haven't really thought about it.

204
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,368
-I'm curious since we live together.
-I understand.

205
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,121
I'll feel better when things are clear.

206
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,542
Are Avian and I
creating an unapproachable vibe?

207
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,378
Yeah, sometimes. Especially at night.

208
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,047
Well, at night,
it's totally fine if you come in.

209
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,842
But it's turned into a space
for just you two.

210
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,218
I suppose.

211
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,556
Sometimes when I go downstairs
and see you two, I'll go back up.

212
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,479
It'd make things easier,
if your relationship was clear.

213
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,106
Why does it matter to you so much?

214
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:16,819
-It feels kind of unsettled otherwise.
-It doesn't.

215
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,239
-On my end.
-Well, maybe for you.

216
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,035
So with the way things are now,

217
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,038
if there was another guy with Avian,

218
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,707
-then you can't say anything.
-That's right.

219
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,920
But if she was your girlfriend,
then she'd consciously not do that.

220
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:40,510
I suppose, but even without
the title of "girlfriend,"

221
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,680
if you really care for each other,
you wouldn't do that.

222
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,894
Have you talked to Avian
about the future?

223
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,105
I have talked to her about it.

224
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,401
-What'd she say?
-It'd be a long-distance relationship.

225
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,697
Because you'll leave Hawaii, you mean?

226
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,702
So you don't plan on changing your plans
according to your relationship?

227
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,417
No, I wouldn't change my plans.

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,876
You're right about that.

229
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,135
That won't work.
What should I bring?

230
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,095
What do I need? Or don't need?

231
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,097
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-Yes.

232
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,224
-What time's the flight?
-7:30 a.m.

233
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,141
Morning?

234
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,184
-Yeah.
-Really?

235
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,981
-For one week?
-Until the 21st.

236
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,359
-How fun.
-I'm looking forward to it.

237
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,986
-Right? How nice.
-I wonder how it'll be.

238
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,613
Have fun.

239
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,117
Thank you. I don't need this.

240
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,798
-Welcome back.
-Hey, Taishi.

241
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,386
How are things? Anything happen?

242
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,682
-The usual.
-The same old?

243
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,977
-I'll put this here.
-Thanks.

244
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,272
-Your hair color.
-You noticed?

245
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,150
-It's a little different.
-I dyed it.

246
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,487
-You did? What about the mohawk?
-I decided not to.

247
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,573
-I got scared.
-Why?

248
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,158
Let me see your hair.

249
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,412
It's super green.

250
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,832
-The way it's dyed...
-I didn't bleach it first.

251
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,001
-Oh, I see.
-I did it as is.

252
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,547
So the parts that were blond turned green.

253
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,051
-How was the Coming of Age celebration?
-It was fun.

254
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,555
-How are you?
-Well, I asked Anna out on a date.

255
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,181
In the last four days?

256
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,642
-What'd she say? Yes?
-She said yes.

257
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,310
We're going horseback riding.

258
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,066
You're eating it like that?

259
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,320
It's hot.

260
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,740
It's Anna.

261
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,826
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

262
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,744
-Welcome back, Guy.
-I'm back.

263
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,705
Wait, did you dye your hair?

264
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,039
-I did.
-She found out.

265
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,667
Welcome back.

266
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,044
It looks good. Insane. Is it green?

267
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,253
I dyed it green.

268
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,339
-Why green?
-I don't know.

269
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,551
I had a dream about green hair.

270
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,260
-A dream? Wow.
-Yeah.

271
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,348
So I thought it was a good idea.

272
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,892
-I got you an apron.
-Really?

273
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,268
Hold on. I'll get it.

274
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,856
Now you can practice cooking.

275
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,568
Yeah, I was planning to today,
but wow, that was fast!

276
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,111
-I went to buy it.
-Wow.

277
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,451
-Did you get to see your friends?
-Yeah, it's been a while.

278
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,669
How is everyone?
Oh, you're going on a date with Taishi.

279
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,880
-Who'd you hear it from? Taishi?
-Taishi.

280
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,964
He told you?

281
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,467
That was fast.

282
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,262
-That's perfect for Anna.
-No way!

283
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,930
Is it a flower pattern?

284
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,016
-It might be a little small.
-It's so cute!

285
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,393
-No, that's just the style.
-Will it fit?

286
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,520
It's tiny.

287
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,355
-Will it fit?
-I'll adjust the neck.

288
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,651
I'm going to practice today,
so you can't be home.

289
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,529
I won't be home. Try it on.

290
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,738
Nice!

291
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,198
-It's perfect.
-It's not too small at all.

292
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,368
-I'm glad.
-It's so cute!

293
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,912
-It's cute, right?
-Thank you.

294
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
No problem.

295
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,291
I'm looking forward to the bento lunch.

296
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,376
Is she gonna ride a horse
with the apron on?

297
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,171
Of course not! No.

298
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,385
Lauren couldn't take the next step
at the park with Taishi.

299
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,095
She couldn't.

300
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,558
-It was a tough situation.
-Yeah.

301
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,770
If only there had been
any moments of silence,

302
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:07,318
then Lauren could have mentally prepared,
and been like, "Okay, so..."

303
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,905
But not with Taishi constantly talking.

304
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,366
He said, "I'll show off saying,
'My friend drew this.'"

305
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,035
He used the word "friend."

306
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm sure in Lauren's mind,
the word "friend" stood out in bold.

307
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,211
He asked if she was cold, and she said
she was but she was okay.

308
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,422
-She was trying.
-She was trying to communicate something.

309
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,217
She's cold but willing to stay.
That means something.

310
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,803
He may have been a little defensive.

311
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,807
When a guy is the first to say,
"Should we get going?"

312
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,851
Yes, it's very telling.

313
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,270
He has completely different attitudes

314
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,897
towards the person he likes
versus his friends.

315
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,649
-Completely different.
-Right?

316
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,069
Taishi is needier with Anna.

317
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,988
He shows his emotions more.

318
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,450
He smiles so happily with her,
like when he was asking for a bento lunch.

319
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,580
"You know, the square thing...

320
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,124
I want you to make me a bento lunch."

321
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,585
That's a technique.

322
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,337
Like High School Lullaby.

323
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:15,552
And Anna and Yuya's lunch,
why was it so tense?

324
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,554
Yeah, why was she attacking him?

325
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:22,226
Ken couldn't hold back his thoughts.
Tell them how you feel.

326
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,604
I can't stand Anna.

327
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,649
-Yeah, Ken.
-She's scary.

328
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,191
-Not for you, eh?
-She's scary.

329
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,693
It's the way she asks.

330
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,820
-You didn't like how she phrased them?
-Yeah.

331
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,532
Sometimes you encounter people
who are really self-righteous.

332
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:41,788
Like when I'm at a party, enjoying myself,
I don't want to hear your life philosophy.

333
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,206
There are people like that.

334
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
Like, "I really wasn't
seeking depth today."

335
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,170
It happens sometimes.

336
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,339
"I had a really hard time
when I was younger,

337
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,425
but I never blamed others for it."

338
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:59,263
-Exactly!
-It's like, "I really don't care!"

339
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:05,019
And while Lauren was packing,
she seemed closed off to Anna.

340
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,522
"Japan seems fun." "Thank you very much."

341
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,820
-It wasn't like that.
-It wasn't.

342
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,323
As deadpan as Ken Watabe.
"Thank you very much.

343
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,243
-I'd be happy to."
-No.

344
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,371
Guy came back.

345
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,917
-And the reason he dyed his hair...
-He had a dream.

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,420
"I saw it in a dream."

347
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,756
He's starting to lose me a little.

348
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,508
-Guy?
-A little.

349
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,971
-I liked when he was Winnie-the-Pooh.
-Really? I'm still into him.

350
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,557
When he said, "I dyed my hair green
because of a dream."

351
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,229
-You were surprised?
-I agree with you Torichan.

352
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,356
I think he's bordering on insane.

353
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,318
Taishi gave Anna an apron.

354
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,739
It would have been funny
if it had been a strange apron,

355
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,532
-but it was very cute.
-He has a good eye.

356
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,994
I wished it had King Kamehameha I on it.

357
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,536
I agree.

358
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,539
-Lauren's gone for how long?
-One week.

359
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:12,544
One week, at this point,
will make things tough for Lauren.

360
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,588
Things will happen with
Taishi and Anna.

361
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,507
She's making him a bento lunch.

362
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,928
If Anna shows no interest in Taishi,

363
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:25,182
-it's possible it will all fall apart.
-That's possible.

364
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,727
She might not be into him.

365
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,353
But she's making him a bento.

366
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,982
Just making a bento lunch is fun.

367
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,651
-I'd make one for you.
-Seriously?

368
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,155
Making a bento lunch for a boy,

369
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,033
that's an event to be excited about.

370
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,911
-You really want to make it great.
-I see.

371
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,203
-Right?
-Yes.

372
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,790
If a girl told me she'll make me
a bento lunch, I'd think she liked me.

373
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,001
How naive.

374
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,586
-I'd fry tons of chicken.
-Right?

375
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,714
-Your fried chicken would be delicious.
-Yes, it would.

376
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,134
-It's probably juicy.
-And you would prep for it.

377
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,553
Yeah, I marinate it the night before.

378
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,768
Marinated over night?
I'd definitely think she liked me.

379
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,812
No, it's all for
the good fried chicken.

380
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,356
-Women are so hard to read!
-Are they?

381
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,901
-They are.
-I see.

382
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,278
"I am going to Japan.
See you soon!"

383
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,906
"Let me know if you want anything.
-Lauren"

384
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,128
I'm back.

385
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,090
Welcome back!

386
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,717
-You just got home?
-I just got home.

387
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,260
From North Shore?

388
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,974
-Are you making something?
-Yeah, a bento lunch.

389
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,350
For Taishi?

390
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,812
I don't have enough time. It's bad.

391
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,817
Looks good. Fried chicken?
You're only starting now?

392
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,486
-Yeah. I hope I finish in time.
-Can I try it?

393
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,739
For sure. I'm making a lot.
You can have some.

394
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:08,035
-Are you using the apron from Taishi?
-Yeah.

395
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,536
It's cute, right?

396
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,000
I thought we had more spices here.

397
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,711
-I'm in trouble.
-I'm hungry.

398
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,507
-I'm hungry, too.
-I haven't eaten.

399
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
-You surfed all day?
-Yeah, it was insane.

400
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,140
I surfed morning, day and night
and just got home.

401
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,850
That's crazy.
You haven't explored Hawaii at all?

402
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,937
Explored? No, not really.

403
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,401
It's good!

404
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,030
I haven't had fried chicken
in a while.

405
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,074
Yeah, it's good.

406
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,076
I'm glad.

407
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,913
-He'll be happy.
-Really? It's good?

408
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,457
-I want to go to LA.
-You seriously should.

409
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,003
-I want to go to acting school.
-We should go to one here.

410
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,212
-I wanna go.
-Let's go.

411
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,175
-I hadn't looked into it at all.
-You're 18 right?

412
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,345
I wish I had started working toward acting
when I was 18.

413
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,766
I'm already 29, so I feel very pressured.

414
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:16,312
My final goal is really vague.

415
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,148
I want to go to Hollywood and be an actor.

416
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,693
I want to be in an action movie.
That's all I've got for now.

417
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,029
I haven't done any research.

418
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,075
-I haven't taken any steps yet.
-I see.

419
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:34,163
That might be why
it's hard to push myself right now.

420
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,707
I write everything in my journal.

421
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,334
-Yeah, you do.
-My goals and such.

422
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,044
I'll show you. Let me grab it.

423
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:48,719
I haven't really written much yet.

424
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,681
These are my goals for 2017.

425
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,767
One is, I want to be in a Hollywood film.

426
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,814
So I thought about what I need to do
in order to make that happen.

427
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,067
I figured this is important.

428
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,863
So what do I need to do
to speak English like a native-speaker?

429
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,450
In order to do that,
I need to go to school.

430
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,579
Another method is to live
with American friends.

431
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,039
Big goals--

432
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,624
-Can I see it?
-Sure.

433
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,337
So you write one big goal,

434
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,716
and break down what you need to do
to reach your goal.

435
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,428
You won't be able to do everything,
but if you write it all down,

436
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:35,224
what you need to do becomes clear.

437
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,393
-It makes you do it?
-Yes.

438
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,146
If you want to focus on
learning English right now,

439
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:45,276
then you should decide
what level you want to reach and by when.

440
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,236
I don't have any of that.

441
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,697
You're probably just going to school.

442
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:56,953
Instead, you should decide what level
you want to reach at school.

443
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,040
Lauren had her exhibit, right?

444
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,292
I was really impressed.

445
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,796
Guy, too, he says he's just a surfer,

446
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,425
but there are many surfers
who can't become pro.

447
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,094
I'm sure it takes Guy a lot of work.

448
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,806
Guy doesn't show it,
but he goes to the beach every day.

449
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,268
-Today, too, he went early in the morning.
-He did.

450
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,854
He's probably thinking
of how he can ride certain waves.

451
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:27,401
That's what he focuses on
and what makes him get up early.

452
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,904
It's important to push yourself.

453
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:35,617
In order to achieve something,
you have to make sacrifices.

454
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,120
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

455
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:42,666
When I first moved to LA,
I researched Japanese actors in LA.

456
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,794
I heard about a guy named Eijiro Ozaki.

457
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,131
He gives presentations and has a book out.

458
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,551
I hadn't heard of him, so I read his book.

459
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,386
I have it now. You can borrow it.

460
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,055
-You brought a lot.
-I'll get it.

461
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:02,060
He's been in The Last Samurai
and Letters from Iwo Jima.

462
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,563
-I've heard of him.
-You have?

463
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,273
This is how I've been studying.

464
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,778
Oh, I got his autograph.

465
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,614
-You met him?
-I did.

466
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,992
Aren't those words great?
"You make your own miracles."

467
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,952
Let's make our miracles, Yuya!

468
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,956
Wow.

469
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,419
I talked too much. I'm thirsty now.

470
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,881
-I'll go get water.
-I'm thirsty, too, actually.

471
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,966
Let's work hard.

472
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,439
OMOTESANDO, TOKYO

473
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,475
ERI TAKANE
CURATOR

474
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,795
Oh, wow.

475
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,263
Oh, wow. It's Santa Claus.

476
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,181
But it's a female Santa Claus.

477
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,776
Amazing.

478
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:19,615
-Yes, it's fantasy.
-I like fantasy.

479
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,826
I like the ones that have fantasy.

480
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,953
-Really?
-Yes.

481
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,790
-Amazing. Do you draw every day?
-I draw every day.

482
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:33,254
I'm not in art school,
but I draw every day for fun.

483
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:43,514
I have until May to decide.

484
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,309
If we show them here,

485
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:51,021
we could potentially show them
on this floor.

486
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,359
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

487
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,577
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

488
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,164
-What's all that?
-Just some stuff.

489
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,042
-Stuff I've prepared.
-Like picnic stuff?

490
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,628
-Not really.
-Wow.

491
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,004
Are you ready?

492
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,800
It doesn't seem like it.

493
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,968
-I'm ready.
-You're ready?

494
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,097
-The bento lunch, too? All set?
-Yup, I'll go get it.

495
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:33,897
-Oh, wow. Nice.
-One is just drinks.

496
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,276
-Which one is it in?
-This one.

497
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,362
-What do you want to drink?
-Anything is fine.

498
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,657
-I got jasmine tea.
-Thanks.

499
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,660
-Got everything?
-Let's see.

500
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,038
Yes, I've got chopsticks and drinks.

501
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,165
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

502
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,381
Have you girls been talking lately?

503
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,050
-Not really.
-No?

504
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,510
Really?

505
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:07,431
The guys talk so much
it's almost gotten boring.

506
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,434
-You three get along well.
-Yeah.

507
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,521
-Are you girls all right?
-We don't talk.

508
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,609
-Do you have any concerns?
-No, not really.

509
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,902
-Though I think Avian does.
-Really?

510
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,364
-Toward me.
-Really?

511
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,281
What makes you say that?

512
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:31,663
It just crossed my mind one time
that Avian might be annoyed with me.

513
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,916
-I don't remember when, though.
-I see.

514
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,754
-There it is! Kualoa Ranch.
-Amazing.

515
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,257
-Jurassic Park was filmed here.
-Really?

516
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,050
-You didn't know?
-I didn't.

517
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,637
-Jurassic Park, Godzilla...
-Insane.

518
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,890
-Hunger Games, Lost...
-Insane!

519
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,016
It is.

520
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,235
-The horses are waiting.
-I'm excited.

521
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,907
Is it here? Oh, there's information.

522
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,618
-Over there. Inside, maybe?
-Oh, inside.

523
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,661
Wow!

524
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,513
Wow!

525
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,445
How is it?

526
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,407
This feels great.

527
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,410
-The views are insane.
-The views are insane.

528
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,670
Are you okay?

529
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,173
Are you okay?

530
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,258
It feels so good.

531
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,681
-It's an amazing view.
-It's so beautiful.

532
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:16,518
Let's go.

533
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,312
Insane. It's really pretty.

534
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,151
-This is a good spot for a picture.
-Right?

535
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,028
I want to take a picture of you.

536
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,364
-It's okay.
-I should've brought one.

537
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,032
Over there...

538
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,786
That's a great shot.

539
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,455
I'm going to take one, too.

540
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,791
You're kind of in it.

541
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,668
-Am I in it?
-Kind of.

542
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,045
Jurassic Park.

543
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,780
I agonized over this.

544
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:11,990
-Nice.
-Here.

545
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,450
-Oh, one for each of us?
-Yeah.

546
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:19,706
Nice. Oh, wow! It looks good.

547
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,249
-Really?
-It's cute.

548
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,002
-I worked pretty hard.
-You really did.

549
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,421
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

550
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,009
-It looks so good.
-I hope it's good!

551
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,220
-I hope it's good.
-Where should I start?

552
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,931
The fried chicken.

553
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,685
It's good.

554
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,479
-Really? It's good?
-Super good.

555
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,189
You can cook.

556
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,234
It's so good.

557
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,362
-I'm glad.
-It's delicious.

558
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,323
-So this was a success?
-A big success.

559
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,576
-Really?
-It's really good.

560
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,785
I'm glad.

561
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,204
-I'm so glad!
-You're a good cook.

562
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:05,126
-Stop raising your expectations.
-It's really good, though.

563
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,130
-The pictures came out well.
-You took a lot.

564
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,800
-Nice.
-It's nice.

565
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,677
-Amazing.
-It looks fun.

566
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,386
-They came out super good.
-Yeah.

567
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,806
I didn't think
the pictures would come out so well.

568
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,100
-Send them to me.
-I'll send them later.

569
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,813
-It was fun, wasn't it?
-It really was.

570
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,983
-It was so good.
-This was a good choice.

571
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,569
-I had so much fun.
-I'm glad.

572
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,032
-It was so beautiful.
-Seriously?

573
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,285
It was so good.

574
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,871
Horse-riding was so good.

575
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,124
It was insane. I had so much fun.

576
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,085
-How was the bento lunch?
-It was so good!

577
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,380
-You saw it, right?
-I did. I ate some.

578
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,217
You did? You weren't supposed to eat it!

579
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,596
Why'd you eat it? That was mine!

580
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,266
-I had some fried chicken.
-That's the main part.

581
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,185
Oh, you! Guy!
The fried chicken was good, right?

582
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:09,941
-I was first to know you'd like it.
-You knew it first?

583
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,069
Was Anna nervous when she was
cooking yesterday?

584
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,865
-I was amazed she wore the apron.
-She did?

585
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,617
-Did you take a picture?
-A picture?

586
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,663
-Why didn't you take a picture?
-You should've told me earlier.

587
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,791
-You should pick up on that.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

588
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,043
-Do you have pictures?
-You want to see?

589
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,753
-They're so good.
-No, that's okay.

590
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,796
What?

591
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,426
-You can just show me.
-Yeah, I'm not going to show Guy.

592
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,678
Guy's not allowed to see.

593
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,555
It was like this.

594
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,308
-Oh, there's a path for the horses.
-Yeah.

595
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,938
-The entrance to Jurassic World.
-The entrance?

596
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,481
-You can go there?
-Yeah.

597
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,901
-Were there any tyrannosauruses?
-No.

598
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,029
-What about triceratops?
-No.

599
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,574
It was really pretty.

600
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,744
How was Anna? What do you think of her?

601
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:07,999
I'm feeling... pretty into her, I think.

602
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,793
-In what way?
-Have things changed?

603
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,004
Do you like talking to her?
Or do you think she's pretty?

604
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,091
She's just cute in all ways.

605
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,971
She hits my strike zone pretty hard.

606
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:25,100
But she seemed like she had fun today.

607
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,229
So I feel like things
are going pretty well.

608
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,064
-You said "interested" before.
-Yeah.

609
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,191
-Now you "like" her.
-Yeah.

610
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,110
-That was quick.
-Is it?

611
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,278
But that's you, Taishi.

612
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,740
-You're here to fall in love.
-That's right.

613
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,658
If I'm here to fall in love,
I need to go full steam.

614
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,662
How did it go with Taishi?

615
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:51,710
We went out today
because he wanted to go on a date.

616
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,962
That's why we went.

617
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,548
But I don't know.
I don't know how Taishi feels.

618
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,175
How do you feel?

619
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,179
I'm not sure how I feel about Taishi.

620
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,308
But it was really fun hanging out.

621
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,520
Does it feel like
it's leading to anything?

622
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,732
Maybe not right now.

623
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:20,405
I don't really feel that way about Taishi.

624
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,490
He's not your type?

625
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,161
I don't think he's my type.

626
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,705
So what type of guy do you like?

627
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,585
I always say someone manly
when I'm asked, but...

628
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:39,340
Well, you do like sports and the outdoors.

629
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,927
So someone who can take the lead
on stuff like that.

630
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,513
-Someone I can do that with.
-But Taishi can do that.

631
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,267
Yeah, but I don't know how Taishi feels.

632
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,145
I'm sure Taishi is interested.

633
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:56,024
-Well, I don't know, but...
-He did say "date."

634
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,570
So I'm sure he's interested, but...

635
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,489
Well, it's fine as long as it's fun.

636
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:10,789
Considering how hard she was
on the others,

637
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,623
-she's rather...
-As long as it's fun?

638
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,459
Oh, no. I said too much.

639
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,545
-It's okay, Torichan.
-It's fine.

640
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,091
She attacked others,
and yet she didn't really give answers.

641
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,968
Of course we're all thinking that.

642
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:27,388
She made him a bento lunch,
but she's not into him.

643
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,433
To top it off, she said he's not her type.

644
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,227
-After all that!
-It's scary.

645
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,729
Or am I the only one who thinks so?

646
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,190
After how she's acted?

647
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,484
I don't know. It stinks.

648
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,652
-It stinks?
-It stinks?

649
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,071
Do we have any Febreze?

650
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:48,534
She wanted to enjoy the horses
and the bento lunch.

651
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,661
That's what it was.

652
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:56,251
But if you keep having fun,
do things escalate?

653
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,418
It's possible.

654
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:01,172
If they keep having fun,
things may happen.

655
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,175
But they can keep doing that,

656
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:08,638
and it could still end
with her thinking he isn't her type.

657
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,600
The way the guys were talking afterward,

658
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,229
it was like a school trip where
they talk about their crush.

659
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,106
-It was like that.
-Right?

660
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,609
"What? You ate it? Why?"

661
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:26,239
-So Taishi's really into her.
-Yes.

662
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,992
He's almost ready to confess his feelings.

663
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,912
The scene with Anna and Avian,

664
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,663
-did it make you nervous?
-Yes.

665
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,917
-Like someone might step over the line?
-Yes.

666
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,171
I felt like no one blinked.
Neither of them.

667
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,174
Maybe they thought if they did,
they'd be killed.

668
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:51,181
If Anna had said she was interested
in Taishi, as well...

669
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,976
If Anna was more clear
about her feelings for Taishi,

670
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:00,273
then Avian may be more understanding,
and the matter would've been settled.

671
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,775
Now that it's clear Anna isn't
into Taishi,

672
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,862
there's a sense that they may
become enemies.

673
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,531
-That's right.
-A hint of it.

674
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,325
Anna and Avian's fight
sounds scary.

675
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,536
-Anna's headstrong too, right?
-Definitely headstrong.

676
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,247
There'd be sparks.
Like, "What's it to you?"

677
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,165
"What?"

678
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,460
She's definitely the type to say, "What?"

679
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,045
She's got the "What?" face.

680
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,382
-I want to see Anna say, "What?"
-I think it would be scary.

681
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,718
They might just go back and forth
saying "What?"

682
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,637
-Like, "What?"
-"What?"

683
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,014
No!

684
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,475
I kind of want to see that.

685
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,478
AOYAMA, TOKYO

686
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,481
TAMANA SHOKUDO

687
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,913
-It's been a while.
-It has.

688
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,708
-How are you?
-It's been so long! I'm good.

689
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,543
-How are you?
-Your hair is long.

690
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,878
-Is yours shorter?
-No.

691
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,588
NAOMI LORRAINE FRANK,
PAST MEMBER

692
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,589
It's the same.

693
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,134
-It's been so long.
-I'm glad I get to see you.

694
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:15,265
-How are things for you?
-Recently...

695
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,642
I had an exhibit.

696
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,852
-In Hawaii.
-That's right.

697
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,063
We have three new members

698
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,525
and there's a different vibe in the house.

699
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,694
Is there any romance?

700
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:32,991
I was interested in Taishi.

701
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,993
-I was.
-"Was"?

702
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,787
Was? Am? I'm not sure.

703
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,914
-Are you still?
-I'm not sure.

704
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,541
-I see.
-Well...

705
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:47,005
I think he's really sweet
and a romantic person.

706
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,800
And I'd go on a date if he asked me out,
but he hasn't.

707
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:56,847
Nothing's happened.
I thought about asking him,

708
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:01,561
but Taishi is interested in Anna.

709
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,106
-I see.
-So, I think...

710
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,025
-I'm okay.
-You're okay?

711
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,069
I'm okay. I...

712
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,112
You won't regret it?

713
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,948
I don't think so.

714
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:19,079
Taishi won't fall for me.

715
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,832
-Why not?
-There isn't that vibe.

716
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,752
He's really interested in Anna.

717
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:32,717
And I'm 18. I want to be with someone
who really likes me.

718
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,762
I'll prepare for Tokyo and a new life.

719
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:44,854
Right now, I'm trying to start a new life.

720
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:52,195
I think it's time to move on
to the next chapter in my life.

721
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,241
You've decided then?

722
00:42:56,324 --> 00:43:00,620
I've been thinking about
when I'd leave from the start,

723
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,913
but after coming here...

724
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,376
I made up my mind.

725
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,463
-So you've decided.
-I haven't told anyone yet,

726
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,925
but I think I'll be able to discover
a new self here in Tokyo.

727
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,886
You'll be in a totally new environment.

728
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,307
I don't know what'll happen,
but I want to do this.
