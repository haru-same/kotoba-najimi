1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,476
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,353
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,816
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,902
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,698
Firstly, the love triangle of Yuya,
Avian, and Naomi.

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,908
That was a scary scene.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,202
Should we go somewhere?
Maybe a café?

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,954
Sure. Let's go.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,997
Why are you embarrassed?

11
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,583
I'm not embarrassed.

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,086
She was listening
as they flirted next door.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,255
It was painful to watch.

14
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,592
-And Yuya and Avian went to lunch.
-That's right.

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:54,179
She pointed out how his behavior
is leading Naomi on.

16
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,472
Being too nice to her.

17
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,727
For example, when Naomi says she's cold...

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,937
you'll lend her your jacket.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,691
-That's not my intention.
-People don't usually do that.

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,319
I think there's a line
to how nice you should be.

21
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,156
He said it was unconscious on his part,
but girls take that the wrong way.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,617
He's being a real brat.

23
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,703
-That's right.
-Go to school, you idiot.

24
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,332
We don't see him going to school much.

25
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,836
He must be close to dropping out
by this episode.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,963
-You think so?
-Definitely.

27
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,799
He's going to be expelled
within three weeks.

28
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:36,388
-Lauren's fashion show.
-She looked so cool in her bathing suit.

29
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,933
-Her body is outrageous.
-Yeah, so amazing.

30
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:44,938
-Yusuke was in awe.
-He got to see her in a bathing suit.

31
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,564
It must have been quite a day.

32
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,360
-It's enough to make your nose bleed.
-For sure.

33
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,947
And Yusuke,
inspired by a certain person...

34
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,991
-That's right!
-That's right.

35
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,117
They came!

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,661
-Seina!
-Yes!

37
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,079
She arrived like a new Godzilla.

38
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,498
I was one of the first members.

39
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,585
-I'm pretty much a legend.
-I knew I heard your name before.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,254
I am a legend.

41
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,298
-Wow.
-I recognized your name.

42
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,842
Are you in love? Are you?

43
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,260
-Are you?
-Not at all.

44
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,219
Well...

45
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,721
-Why are you being vague?
-You definitely are.

46
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,848
So if there's someone
you're interested in,

47
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,850
you should ask them out on a date.

48
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,143
Thank you.

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,521
-See you!
-Thank you.

50
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,773
That was fun.

51
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,899
"Hug me," isn't it?

52
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,777
-She did say that.
-We got to hear her say, "Hug me."

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,154
It's the only English she knows.

54
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,658
-Thanks to Seina's urging...
-That's right.

55
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,992
Yusuke...

56
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,120
-This will probably be this week's focus.
-Yeah!

57
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,997
You want to see a movie together?

58
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,624
Is there anything you want to see?

59
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,086
I'm sure there is. I'm sure.

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,587
-Seriously?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,130
Something must be playing.

62
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,967
-But Lauren said it pretty clearly, right?
-Yeah.

63
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,761
She doesn't see him that way.

64
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,472
-At least not now.
-She doesn't see him like that.

65
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:05,143
I'm sure you know,
but I don't feel that way towards Yusuke.

66
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,644
You don't know what to do?

67
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,146
I should give him a chance.

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,316
If you go and you have fun...

69
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,567
then you're okay?

70
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,448
If nothing romantic happens,
then that's fine with me.

71
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,368
He asked her out because he likes her.

72
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,497
She's hesitant, but she'll give it
a chance, like a trial period.

73
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,084
She said if she has fun, then maybe...

74
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,628
It's a test. The first in his life.

75
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,296
What was your first date movie?

76
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,547
What was it?

77
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,009
We'll wait while you remember.

78
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,595
Oh, that's right!

79
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,807
The theater happened
to be showing old films.

80
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,102
-How hipster.
-So it was Stand By Me.

81
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,063
-Nice!
-One hundred points!

82
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,900
-One hundred points? For real?
-It's so nice!

83
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,151
I'm hot now.

84
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,113
In my case, it was Cape Fear,

85
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,033
the serial murderer film
with Robert De Niro.

86
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,035
-The scary one!
-It was heavy stuff.

87
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,328
De Niro just kept killing.

88
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,582
But somehow I still
managed to get my first kiss.

89
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,918
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

90
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,461
-You left the theater and...
-And...

91
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,673
while we walked,
I tried my best to lighten the mood by...

92
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,675
-Distracting her.
-...distracting her.

93
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,344
And when we reached the river bank,
I kissed her.

94
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,763
That's so nice.

95
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,349
-What a great comeback.
-I did make a comeback.

96
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,185
What's wrong?

97
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,854
I'm just waiting to be asked, too.

98
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,648
-Should we start?
-Yes.

99
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,193
It was a cartoon movie for me, by the way.

100
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,363
Well, Yusuke asked me out today...

101
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,115
-to a movie.
-He asked you?

102
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,909
-He asked me to go.
-Oh, he asked you?

103
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:50,498
I've been pretty clear about
my feelings towards Yusuke.

104
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,667
-That's true.
-You know already.

105
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,669
I've said it...

106
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,424
but everyone still egged Yusuke on.

107
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,678
Like, "Yeah, go for it. It'll work out."
That kind of thing.

108
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,264
Everyone still supported him.

109
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,102
But you all knew how I felt.

110
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,436
So...

111
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,441
you all knew I'd reject him if he asked.

112
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,570
And yet, you still egged him on.

113
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,782
It made me mad.
It was like this was a game for you guys.

114
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,035
-Like it was just a joke.
-Yeah.

115
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:31,915
Yusuke was saying
that he was ready for it.

116
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,542
So we were letting him do
what he wanted to do.

117
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,296
It was ultimately Yusuke's decision.

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,288
It seems wrong for us
to tell him how you feel.

119
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:16,834
Everyone's cheering Yusuke on,
and if I reject him...

120
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:22,215
I was thinking
it would make me the bad guy.

121
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,134
-I don't think that at all.
-No.

122
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,032
MANAGER
KOZO UBUKATA

123
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,117
-What should we do today?
-Well...

124
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,743
So the day after tomorrow...

125
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,787
This is a little embarrassing but...

126
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,334
-I'm going on my very first date.
-Oh, a date.

127
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,086
I have the opportunity...

128
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,921
-I want to look my best.
-Okay.

129
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,506
-If you can help.
-Got it.

130
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,636
-She said okay, but...
-Yeah.

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,849
I'm not sure if it's because
she has feelings for me, or...

132
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,476
How should I put this?

133
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:20,273
If it's because she felt sorry for me.
I'm not sure which one it is.

134
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,650
You shouldn't think about it like that.

135
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,238
It might have been
a little reckless on my part, but...

136
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,617
I want to be honest with my feelings.

137
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,996
I want to be clear.

138
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,373
I'm just going for it.

139
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,462
For the first date...

140
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,382
you usually hold hands.

141
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,259
-So soon?
-That's the goal.

142
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,761
-No way.
-That should be the goal.

143
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,102
There are things that can only be conveyed
by touch between a man and a woman.

144
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:02,315
I've only just recently
been able to talk to her.

145
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,735
When you're going up the theater stairs...

146
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,990
you can take her hand to guide her.

147
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,285
You can imagine doing that, right?

148
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,495
It'd be cool if I could.

149
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,882
Wow.

150
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,099
-Here you go.
-Okay.

151
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,725
-Thank you.
-Okay.

152
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,394
-Do your best.
-I will.

153
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,314
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

154
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,398
Thanks.

161
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,628
You're doing that on purpose!

162
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,089
-Cold?
-It's very cold.

163
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,685
-Okay.
-Is that it?

164
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,187
Okay.

165
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,816
Ouch!

166
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,901
Ouch!

167
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,529
-It didn't break.
-Ouch!

168
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,241
-Why didn't it break?
-That caught me by surprise.

169
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,950
-It didn't break.
-You're the worst!

170
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,996
Hey!

171
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,426
No fair.

172
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,095
That's too close.

173
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,683
-It's too hard to throw otherwise.
-You can do it.

174
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,232
Ow!

175
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,317
Ow!

176
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,069
You did it!

177
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,159
We were hanging out here today.

178
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,202
-With who?
-With Naomi.

179
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,663
We played with water balloons.

180
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,916
And Avian was in a bad mood before that.

181
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,001
-Even before?
-Yeah.

182
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,672
I asked her if she wanted to join,
and she said, "No, you guys go."

183
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,090
So we did.

184
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,343
And then she asked how it went
after she came home.

185
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,428
I said it was fun.

186
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,265
Then she said I'm like a kid
and she can't keep up with me.

187
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,311
And I got really pissed.

188
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,438
-Annoyed?
-Yeah.

189
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,025
Our age difference has bothered me.

190
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,738
But I thought maybe it'd be fine.

191
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,283
But I've been seeing it more lately.

192
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,201
Yuya...

193
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,331
is the type of person
who always needs attention.

194
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,249
That neediness.

195
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,253
-You don't like it?
-No, I don't like it.

196
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,798
And I don't know how Yuya feels.

197
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:00,177
He said he comes on strong...

198
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,889
but he's actually not like that.

199
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:08,436
So rather than me always talking to him...
I mean...

200
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,859
-What he says and does are different?
-They are.

201
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,403
It's not just that though.

202
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,989
The age difference is the main thing.

203
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:25,912
Would you think that about his personality
even if you ignored the fact that he's 18?

204
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,455
You don't feel the same?

205
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,332
Me? Not really.

206
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,833
No?

207
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,918
No.

208
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,047
Do you talk about things
like that with him?

209
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,507
About what?

210
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,091
Like how he feels?

211
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,928
I was thinking of asking.

212
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,930
Sounds like you don't at all, then.

213
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,890
Even though you're so close.

214
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,726
So when you're with him,

215
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,771
-you don't have any deep conversations?
-Not at all.

216
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,606
We watch comedies,

217
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,068
or we throw water balloons
at each other. That's it.

218
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,195
There's no deep conversation.

219
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,657
We've only talked about useless stuff.

220
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,828
I'm sorry, but that's exactly
what I can't keep up with.

221
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,415
-So that's the problem?
-I'm sorry, but yeah.

222
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,716
What's that look for?

223
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,801
No, I was just like, "I see."

224
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,804
I still get along with him.

225
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,515
-We talk at night.
-Yeah.

226
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,685
That's how it is.

227
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,400
From Avian's point of view,

228
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,112
you always ask her out.

229
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,531
-Yeah.
-If I were her,

230
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,618
I'd probably get sick of it.

231
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,413
Like maybe you're just leading her on.

232
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,750
I think it was a similar situation.

233
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,586
We're not really a couple yet.

234
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,295
I'm attracted to her...

235
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,467
but I'm just hanging out with Naomi
as friends.

236
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,301
You're not in a relationship,

237
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:09,140
but you've shown interest
to a certain degree.

238
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,059
She might be feeling confused.

239
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,279
Avian, let's talk.

240
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,239
-Huh?
-Come out for a bit.

241
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,211
It's not happening.

242
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,800
To be honest with you...

243
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,095
I asked you out
because I'm interested in you.

244
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,933
I talk to you

245
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,852
because I want to get to know you.

246
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,022
So this afternoon,

247
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,526
I was being insensitive to your feelings.

248
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,071
I apologize for being inconsiderate.

249
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,365
You said that...

250
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:14,872
when you're interested in someone,
you're the type to take action, right?

251
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,501
-Yeah.
-But you're always with Naomi.

252
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:23,214
So I'm not sure how you feel about me.

253
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,802
To be honest, I just don't know.

254
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:35,267
You're saying I don't seem interested?

255
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,270
Then why would I ask you out?

256
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,023
Why would I ask you on a date?

257
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,652
You wanted to try and see how it went?

258
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,571
I don't know.

259
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,157
That's not why I asked you out at all.

260
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,413
You're the best for me.

261
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,792
I asked you out because
I want to get to know you.

262
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,671
I still plan to ask you out.

263
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,801
I just don't really understand.

264
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:17,184
So the way I act with you...

265
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:22,398
and the way I act with Naomi
is too different.

266
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,983
Yeah, I don't get it.

267
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,530
You seem to have more fun with her.

268
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,784
You seem to be more yourself
when you're with her.

269
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:37,664
And when you're with me,
you don't seem like yourself.

270
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:42,835
Seeing that, it just makes me think
we're not a good fit.

271
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:49,634
It just makes me wonder
if you are even aware of that.

272
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,221
But I think it's obvious
if you look at it from the outside.

273
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,182
I haven't noticed that at all.

274
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,729
In my mind, Naomi is a friend.

275
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,900
And you're someone I want to be
more than friends with.

276
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,695
-That part...
-It's not like that at all.

277
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,279
That part...

278
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,198
isn't distinguishable.

279
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,408
And that pisses me off.

280
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,870
But the one thing I want you to know

281
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,958
is that even if I seem close with Naomi...

282
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,920
the person I'm interested in is you.

283
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,799
Okay.

284
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,099
-I'm going in.
-Okay.

285
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,365
-She's annoyed.
-She's pretty upset.

286
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,369
There was some friction when she said,
"What's with that look?"

287
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,665
It's like, "If you're not interested
in me, that's fine.

288
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,043
But if you're interested
and asking me out on dates...

289
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,588
and you act like that?"

290
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,508
She's made it clear
she doesn't get it, right?

291
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,804
But Avian has never said
that she likes Shibusawa.

292
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,972
That's true.

293
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,141
She was almost cheering Naomi on.

294
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,060
So it's not right for her
to go yelling at Naomi.

295
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,561
That's true!

296
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,982
I'd be confused if I were Naomi.

297
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,318
I don't think she was yelling at Naomi.

298
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,570
Okay, right, she wasn't yelling.

299
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,657
Do you think it's jealousy?

300
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,701
Jealousy?

301
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,288
If it's not, then why did she say,
"What's with that look?"

302
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,957
-Maybe there's a little jealousy.
-It's a little scary.

303
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,375
Because she's been asked out...

304
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,460
-It's like jealousy oil.
-Oil?

305
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,546
Like truffle oil.

306
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,589
It's not truffle, but...

307
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,051
-Just a touch of aroma.
-Yes, an aroma.

308
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,219
-The aroma of jealousy?
-Oh, yeah.

309
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,305
Yes, an aroma of annoyance and jealousy.

310
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,390
-Annoyance topped with jealousy?
-Yes!

311
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,474
I see.

312
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,310
The chef's salad.

313
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,813
-Careless Yuya has done it again!
-Exactly.

314
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,522
That's what it is.

315
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,735
Aside from this, what do you think
of Lauren's behavior?

316
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,737
Is it acceptable? I mean...

317
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,530
I'm a little turned off.

318
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:22,203
If everyone takes Yusuke's side
and she doesn't go out with him,

319
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:27,667
she thinks they'll think badly of her.

320
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,168
She feels pressured.

321
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,670
But does she...

322
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:35,549
have to tell everyone
she's not interested in him?

323
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,636
As Yusuke becomes a man...

324
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,056
"Ask a girl out on a first date."

325
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,140
"Done." Stamp.

326
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,641
-"Stamped."
-He gets a stamp.

327
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,938
"Research and prepare for the date."

328
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,898
-"Done." Stamped.
-Stamped.

329
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,276
But Yusuke getting rejected
also gives him another stamp.

330
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,652
That's right. It's fine.

331
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,488
It all depends on how she rejects him.

332
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,658
But she's not the type of girl
that'll take young Yusuke

333
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,662
and play with him
in the palm of her hands.

334
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,874
-She takes him seriously.
-Yes.

335
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,918
Remember there was the girl
who held hands with Arman?

336
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,212
And then said she saw him as a brother?

337
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,756
The hat-maker from Kagoshima.

338
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,719
-You loved the hat-maker from Kagoshima!
-That's right.

339
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,888
It was her black hair
and that she's from Kagoshima.

340
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:22,972
Why wouldn't she be good?

341
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,850
-So you've stamped "black-haired."
-Yes.

342
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,060
Not all black-haired girls are good.

343
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,688
-You've graduated from that.
-Yes. Blondes can be good people, too.

344
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:35,484
Yes, so you learn one by one.

345
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,405
I hope Yusuke gets a lot of stamps.

346
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,907
That's right.

347
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,784
What's with the straw hat?

348
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,453
-Oh, a friend--
-I'm back.

349
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,620
Welcome back.

350
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,748
Where were you?

351
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,333
-I bought clothes.
-You serious?

352
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,543
It's tomorrow.

353
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,670
Wow.

354
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,256
-I'm nervous, but excited.
-That's right, it's tomorrow.

355
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:04,221
Yeah. Kozo, the hair stylist,
gave me some advice.

356
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,851
-Like what?
-That if it's a date...

357
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,313
then I should at least hold her hand.

358
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,606
That's what he told me.

359
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,567
-I was like, "Really?"
-Are you going to?

360
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,028
He said touching brings you closer.

361
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,199
-You mean physical contact?
-Yeah, he said it's important.

362
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,575
So...

363
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,869
I was thinking maybe that's true.

364
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm considering it.

365
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,960
It's best to do it naturally.

366
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,628
If you make awkward physical contact,

367
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,798
it might be like sexual harassment.
Be careful.

368
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,049
That's true.

369
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,095
I'd hate if she thought that of me.

370
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:48,015
So this is what I bought today.

371
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,936
According to Kozo,
you can't go wrong with white.

372
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,395
A white shirt.

373
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,897
Or so he told me.

374
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,649
But I tried various ones on today.

375
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,652
This isn't quite pink, but reddish.

376
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:06,158
I got confused and couldn't decide.

377
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,120
-What about your pants?
-It depends on your pants.

378
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,123
I also bought boots.

379
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,624
-You bought boots?
-Boots, too?

380
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,209
Yeah, they're brown.

381
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,544
It really depends on the pants.

382
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,298
Should I do black or these?

383
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,591
Denim.

384
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,885
-That.
-This?

385
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,345
White looks super serious.

386
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,225
-So it's better to be more casual?
-Yeah.

387
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,309
I see.

388
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,064
After the movie,
you're gonna go out and eat?

389
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,941
Yeah, maybe dinner.

390
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,359
-Wow.
-Where?

391
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,820
It should be somewhere she could eat.

392
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:47,408
-Like vegan food?
-Yeah, somewhere with vegan food.

393
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,826
Otherwise, it wouldn't work.

394
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:53,039
I was going to give some options.

395
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,207
I took quite some time.

396
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,584
You've already asked her to dinner?

397
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,297
-Not yet.
-Not yet? So tomorrow?

398
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,299
-After the movie?
-Probably.

399
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,010
-Sounds good.
-Sounds fun.

400
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,137
It sounds like fun.

401
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,305
Are you nervous?

402
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,140
Yeah.

403
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,849
Pretty nervous.

404
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,918
-Good.
-Good? Good.

405
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,588
Okay, then should we go?

406
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,883
-What time does it start?
-Let's see.

407
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,844
I think it's at 4:30 p.m.

408
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,555
-Oh, then let's get tickets.
-Should we go?

409
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,023
It's been a long time.

410
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,405
This isn't a sequel or anything, right?

411
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,657
It's a new work?

412
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,118
-Yeah.
-But it's the same...

413
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,496
It's a new work by J.K. Rowling.

414
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,958
So it's by the same author
as Harry Potter?

415
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:24,296
It's not Harry Potter,
but it's the same author.

416
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,842
-The feel will probably be similar.
-Oh, the same author.

417
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,344
I'm looking forward to it.

418
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,180
-I'm also looking forward to it.
-It'll be good I'm sure.

419
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,230
-Here?
-Is it here?

420
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,078
All right.

421
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,123
-What'd you think?
-It was insane.

422
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,084
-Did you like it?
-I want to talk about it more.

423
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,586
-You know?
-Ah, the movie.

424
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,423
It got dark so early.

425
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,053
It's already 7:00 p.m.

426
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,595
Yeah.

427
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,014
Already? 7:00 p.m., huh?

428
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,099
It's late.

429
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,727
Are you hungry, Lauren?

430
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,772
I'm a little hungry.

431
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,649
Do you want to get dinner?

432
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,904
-No?
-I have dinner with my grandma on Fridays.

433
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,324
-I see.
-We eat together.

434
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,826
Then don't worry about it.

435
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,370
-I'm sorry today doesn't work.
-Don't worry about it.

436
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,330
Thanks.

437
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,000
-Bye. Thanks.
-Bye.

438
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,463
He still followed through
with his reservations.

439
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,090
That's so true.

440
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:17,261
-Yeah, you'd normally cancel it.
-Bittersweet.

441
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:22,266
But he went by himself
and told them he had reservations.

442
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,935
I'm giving him three stamps!

443
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,728
-He got a lot this time.
-He did well.

444
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,730
-He did well.
-He did well.

445
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,816
What do you get for these stamps?

446
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,359
You can't ask that.

447
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,987
You can't think of it like that.
What would you exchange them for?

448
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,948
Well, for example...

449
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,408
an easy woman.

450
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,163
-You're the worst!
-No, Yamachan! No. Just no!

451
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,209
Why would five stamps get you
an easy woman?

452
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,960
What do you think women are?

453
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,462
So if you collect stamps...

454
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,798
If you collect a lot of stamps,

455
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,676
easy women will be around
before you realize.

456
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,261
Will they?

457
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,097
A lot of stamps means
you've become an impressive man.

458
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,935
At one point, God will reward you
with an easy woman.

459
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,187
Don't look this way, Triendl.

460
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,106
What do you mean by "easy women"?

461
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,026
By "easy women", he means "angels."

462
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,945
"Angels"?

463
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,449
A different type of girl from you.

464
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,619
A different class of "angels."

465
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,831
You're an angel in class one.

466
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:31,001
But there are angels in class eight, too.

467
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,211
A class pretty far away.

468
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,923
Yes, so you'd never cross paths
in the hall.

469
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,175
-It's a different department.
-Yes.

470
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,972
We have to ease the mood
to offset that sad scene.

471
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,516
It really was sad.

472
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,396
In the end,
after being rejected by a woman,

473
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,274
you eat catfish?
What's with that?

474
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,528
If this were a movie or a drama,
it'd be pretty cliché.

475
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,489
-But this is real.
-That's right.

476
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:05,201
If the context hadn't been set,
and she had dinner plans with her grandma,

477
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,538
then I'd think that
this was just bad timing for Yusuke.

478
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,748
But right up until then,

479
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,335
she kept saying how she didn't
want to be the bad guy.

480
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,630
And for her to say
she's having dinner with her grandma,

481
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,341
isn't that a little...

482
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,634
terrible of her?

483
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,471
By limiting it to just the movie,

484
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:29,810
she's hinting how she feels towards him.

485
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,062
That she doesn't like him?

486
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,858
So there's Lauren, who lives
by her own rules and expresses herself,

487
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,153
and then there's Yusuke,
who took a step towards adulthood.

488
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,656
Then he said, "Don't worry about it",

489
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,492
and went to eat alone
since he made a reservation.

490
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,827
-That was impressive.
-Right?

491
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,955
He experienced all the flavors
of the catfish.

492
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,873
He'll never forget that taste.

493
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,501
I'm sure he couldn't taste anything.

494
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,712
That's why, years down the line,

495
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,631
when he goes to the movies
with a girl he really likes,

496
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,300
and they have catfish after,

497
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,386
that's when he'll really taste catfish
for the first time.

498
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,638
How romantic!

499
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,434
It is, but can we move the focus
away from catfish?

500
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,980
Yusuke would say,
"So this is what catfish tastes like,"

501
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:19,109
And his future girlfriend would say,

502
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,153
"Is this your first time having catfish?"

503
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,655
And Yusuke would answer,

504
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,866
"Yeah, it's my first time."

505
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,285
And he'd look at the camera and...

506
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,081
And then...

507
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,251
It turns into a comedy.

508
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,878
It turns into a comedy!

509
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:43,425
-You're not satisfied?
-I can't agree.

510
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,721
You're all being too positive,
and not caring enough.

511
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,348
But then, what is caring?

512
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,182
Oops, sorry. I'll do this on YouTube.

513
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,272
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

514
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:01,652
What?

515
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,573
How was it?

516
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,244
-We went to see a movie.
-What did you see?

517
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,498
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

518
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,709
-Harry Potter?
-It's the same world, but new.

519
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,671
-I wanted to see that.
-That sounds good!

520
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,548
-I want to see it.
-It was really good.

521
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,340
Yeah, the movie was good.

522
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,468
-Entertaining?
-It was.

523
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,096
How was Yusuke?
What was he like?

524
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,351
He asked if I wanted to have dinner after.

525
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,689
To go have dinner with him.

526
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:43,652
But I told him it's Friday
and my grandma cooked already

527
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,404
so I was going to have dinner with her.

528
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,572
And that was it.

529
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,533
-So it was just the movie?
-Yeah, just the movie.

530
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,829
We didn't talk much
since we were in a movie theater.

531
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,831
That's how it went.

532
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,001
Are you okay?

533
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,090
I'm not interested in him.

534
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,760
-No interest?
-None.

535
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,806
-He's good as a friend?
-He's good as a friend.

536
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,893
You can't see him as anything more.

537
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,065
It was...

538
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,028
How should I put this?

539
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,532
We couldn't talk much.

540
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,535
Or, I mean...

541
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,455
there was no time to talk.

542
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,750
-None?
-Yeah, none.

543
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,793
There must have been some.

544
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,795
While we were in line for tickets,

545
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,922
and a little during the previews,

546
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,466
I tried to talk to her.

547
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,968
What about during dinner?

548
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,052
Dinner...

549
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,348
She had plans with her grandma.

550
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,558
-What?
-What?

551
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,686
-Really?
-She said she does every Friday.

552
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,355
I had forgotten.

553
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:07,861
-I see.
-So I went to eat by myself.

554
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,283
She does go every Friday, that's right.

555
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,536
-Totally forgot about that.
-Me, too.

556
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,203
It was a surprise.

557
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,542
-But did you ask her to dinner anyway?
-I did.

558
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,044
And she said she can't
because of her grandma?

559
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,213
Yeah, she apologized.

560
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,923
But, actually...

561
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,593
she cares about her family.

562
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,012
And she should take care of her grandma.

563
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,265
It can't be helped.

564
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,225
-Yeah, it can't be helped.
-Yeah.

565
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,436
Still, it must have been a shock.

566
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,106
Yeah, it definitely got to me.

567
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,361
It felt like she was just being nice.

568
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,239
Like she came to be nice.

569
00:33:55,158 --> 00:34:00,581
It didn't feel right to me.
It felt uncomfortable.

570
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,540
Yeah.

571
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,167
It was a really good experience.

572
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,170
And Lauren...

573
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:12,425
she's a really good person
for even coming with me.

574
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,096
But for me...

575
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,348
after today...

576
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,102
going out together made me think...

577
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,480
that maybe we're not a good fit.

578
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,485
But you wouldn't have known that
without going on a date.

579
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,405
It's not something you'd know
from just hanging out at home.

580
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,032
I think it was good.

581
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:40,662
So, what I'm thinking at this point...

582
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,498
is that I'm going to give up.

583
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,710
Yeah.

584
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,132
If you're saying you want to give up,

585
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,426
then you're free to do that.

586
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,765
If you say you want to try asking her
out again, then I'm here for you.

587
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,601
I don't know...

588
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,146
what'll happen in the future.

589
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,480
But for now...

590
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,403
I think...

591
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,661
I should focus more on what I need to do
and what I'm working on now.

592
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:33,006
There's something
that's been bothering me.

593
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:39,095
Everyone seems to have the wrong idea
about Yuya and me...

594
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,722
and our relationship.

595
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:46,102
It's true that, at first,
I was certainly interested in him.

596
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:54,527
But the biggest reason for that
was because my last boyfriend of six years

597
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,529
had the exact same name.

598
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,156
-Yuya?
-Yeah.

599
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,453
And I used to call him Yuya-kun.

600
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:08,499
I was drunk on the feeling
of calling him that.

601
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,754
So I was interested,
but not because I liked him.

602
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,591
I really think of him as a friend now.

603
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,926
Yeah.

604
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:24,015
I wanted to apologize,
if I made you feel uncomfortable...

605
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:29,187
every time you were out
on a date with him.

606
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,442
I want you to go out with him
without worrying about anything.

607
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,989
I'm not sure where you guys are at, but--

608
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,743
-I'm glad you told me.
-Was it better I did?

609
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,494
Yeah, it's better.

610
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,661
Of course.

611
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:49,249
I was really worried about it.

612
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,295
And I wanted to hear your thoughts, too.

613
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,382
I was going to talk to you about it.

614
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,384
I've wanted to tell you that.

615
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,094
Thank you.

616
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,766
-Oh, wow.
-Looks so good!

617
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,850
Wow.

618
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,270
Now, on to the main topic.

619
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,359
I'm leaving.

620
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,611
What?

621
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,280
You're kidding.
