1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,722
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:18,143
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,937
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,607
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

5
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,069
-There is no script at all.
-Yes, that's how it is.

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:31,698
Torichan is at a very important job
once again this week.

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,534
-Today's the last day.
-Yes.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,161
We might easily go off track today.

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,997
Please bear with us.

10
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,462
Hold on...
It's better than I imagined.

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,340
She was nervous
and dressed nicely for the occasion.

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:53,511
And Yuya, who was with Naomi, said...

13
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,097
"I'm bored."

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,473
-I've had enough.
-Bored of it?

15
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,350
For a while now.

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,853
But this isn't a date.

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,148
-What is it, then?
-We're hanging out.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,441
Just killing time.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,278
-His choice of words...
-He was a little cold.

20
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,197
I'm sure his intentions aren't bad, but...

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,618
-it was a poor choice.
-It wasn't considerate.

22
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,870
And the troubles continue.

23
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,830
Eric, Yuya, Naomi, and Avian

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,333
all went surfing so Naomi could learn.

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,879
But Eric and Yuya left Naomi

26
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:31,174
so they could enjoy themselves
and surf alone.

27
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,594
She felt a little sad about that.

28
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,805
But the terrible truth is revealed...

29
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,181
-In the evening.
-Yes.

30
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,433
The night before you went surfing...

31
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,688
Eric said, "It would be better
if Naomi weren't coming."

32
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,314
Like he didn't want her to come?

33
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,526
He said it wouldn't be fun.

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,611
I see.

35
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:54,197
I didn't think Eric was that kind of guy.

36
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,367
I thought he'd be mature...

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,120
and be able to pick up on how people feel.

38
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,830
-Yeah, he's the oldest.
-He wasn't at all.

39
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,916
And thought he'd be like a big brother.

40
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,002
-He's done for, right, Kentaro?
-He's... Yes.

41
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,379
I wanna hear you say it.
He's done for, right?

42
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,881
Yes, he's... Yes.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,717
-You said it.
-Is he trying to make him look bad?

44
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,094
-He said it.
-He's noting the time!

45
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,846
You can't arrest him.

46
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,940
Today is Eric's last chance.

47
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,985
Depending on his response,
he may burn bridges.

48
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,528
He'll be hated.

49
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,448
Maybe we'll witness
Lauren's witchcraft for the first time.

50
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,367
Lauren's going to be like...

51
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,288
And her drawings will come to life.

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,710
-The ones with the horns?
-Yeah, the ones with the horns.

53
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,128
-Strange bugs will come.
-Scary!

54
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:54,466
If he announces his bedtime again,
we're replacing him.

55
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,346
I'm sure that's not what she's mad about.

I am. The NBA.

64
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,017
You know the other day...

65
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,521
-when we all went surfing together?
-Yeah.

66
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,607
Would you like to sit here?

67
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,068
-Okay.
-You're a bit far.

68
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,871
So...

69
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,415
when we went surfing...

70
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:42,129
I really didn't take into consideration...

71
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,548
what you were feeling.

72
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,886
When you heard what I said earlier...

73
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,972
I'm sure you thought...

74
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,474
that I didn't want you there.

75
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,895
I feel really bad about that.

76
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,940
Since Avian was around,
I assumed you'd tag along with her.

77
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:08,989
I'm really sorry about that.

78
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,034
I didn't realize you felt hurt.

79
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,247
I just wanted to tell you that.

80
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,250
Thank you.

81
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,797
I don't want you to think
that I don't like you.

82
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,550
I'm glad.

83
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,470
-You're okay?
-Yeah.

84
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,395
-Hold on a second.
-Yeah.

85
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,314
It's okay. Take your time.

86
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,652
Coming to Hawaii from Japan...

87
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,407
Right now...

88
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,951
the only friends I have...

89
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,496
are the people in Terrace House.

90
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,374
So if I can't get along...

91
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,378
with the people here...

92
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,423
then...

93
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:13,553
I'm not going to have any friends.

94
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,306
And...

95
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,851
it was my first time surfing.

96
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,019
I was really scared.

97
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,190
I couldn't really swim when I first came.

98
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,901
But I've been practicing
in the pool every day.

99
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,490
-You have.
-I didn't want to slow everyone down.

100
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,033
I even practiced freestyle.

101
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,661
So...

102
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:43,750
Well, I understand that you're the type
who prefers to do things alone.

103
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,463
But I'd like to surf.

104
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,049
Not just surf,
but enjoy other things with you, too.

105
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,760
Oh, of course.

106
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,889
We can all enjoy it together.

107
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,270
-Please bear with me next time.
-Of course.

108
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,272
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,399
I didn't mean to cry.

110
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,776
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,657
He's arrogant in a way
that's typical of men.

112
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,536
He called her over
even though he's doing the apologizing.

113
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,580
-Usually you go to the other person.
-Yeah.

114
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,417
-Is that how it is in America?
-I don't think that matters.

115
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,043
-It doesn't, right?
-Yeah.

116
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,922
She's doing something,
but he called her over because it's far.

117
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,050
It's far for his own purposes.

118
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,594
He's the one who sat there.

119
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,888
-Wasn't there a chair next to her?
-There was.

120
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,142
-Yusuke sat there before.
-Seriously? Unacceptable.

121
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,937
And what Naomi said when she was crying...

122
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,526
It's true.
She's come from Japan entirely on her own.

123
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,405
So if the other members don't like her,
it's all over for her.

124
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,742
And they've shared drinks together,
talked and...

125
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,829
-That's right.
-Just as she started to get to know him,

126
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,166
hearing that he felt that way
would be tough on her.

127
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,044
Man, why did Lauren and Avian
solve that so unenthusiastically.

128
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,130
"Should we hug?"
"No, let's have coffee and call it a hug."

129
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,049
What's with that?

130
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,303
-What's with that?
-But, but...

131
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:24,016
they clearly said they thought
what he did wasn't right.

132
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,854
That was good. It was very American.

133
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,481
It was a very American solution.

134
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:33,776
-It feels like Eric got away with it.
-I don't know about that.

135
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,698
Eric's reaction
to what they said was fine.

136
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,494
It didn't seem
like he really felt that bad.

137
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,373
He probably doesn't really understand
what the problem was.

138
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,707
It hasn't sunk in.

139
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,418
Even when she cried,
he said, "Take your time."

140
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,005
Yeah, it's like, what do you mean?
You're the one making her cry.

141
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,174
-I know!
-"Take your time." No, that's not it.

142
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,135
He wouldn't be a good lover.

143
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,513
-Yes, that type.
-Right? That type.

144
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,098
The type that just bangs and then says,
"That was good."

145
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,935
Yeah, like, "That was great, baby."
It's like, are you an idiot?

146
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,729
-Like, "I haven't gotten off yet."
-Exactly!

147
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,273
Torichan!

148
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,108
-Torichan!
-Torichan!

-Yeah.

00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,600
Thank you for that.
Thanks to you, I think it went well today.

154
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,602
I'm glad it went well.

155
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,649
I've been here for three years,
but there were many words I didn't know.

156
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,026
-It was hard, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

157
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,111
Résumé vocabulary is difficult.

158
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,364
-I'd never written one before, so...
-Yeah.

159
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,323
Are you starting your job soon?

160
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,410
-Have you started already?
-What? No.

161
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,872
-When do you start?
-They're going to call me to let me know.

162
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,500
If I get the job,
they'll tell me when I start.

This is how you make a burger, right?

165
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,592
I think so.

166
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,928
Well, I think you mix it more, but...

167
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,221
I'm making my own lunch.

168
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,683
-That's sad.
-Yeah, it's sad.

169
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,143
There's no one to make it for you.

How did the talk go yesterday?

171
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,274

-Yeah, you talked, right?

00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:04,904
We did.
She started to cry, and that surprised me.

173
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,739
It's been a while.

174
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,699
-Since a girl cried in front of you?
-Yeah.

175
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,868
-You made her cry.
-I don't really...

176
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,539
-Naomi's really girly, right?
-Yeah.

177
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:19,210
All of my friends tend to be frank.

178
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,337
Avian is easy in that sense.

179
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:26,217
-Yeah, she's easy to read.
-Yeah. She's got a temper.

180
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,513
She can look really scary when she's mad.

181
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,182
Like, she'll kill you
if you don't apologize.

182
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,101
Lauren, too.

183
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,186
Lauren's the scariest.

184
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,772
Lauren is really smart.

185
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,192
I like girls who speak their minds.

186
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,152
-Really?
-Yeah.

187
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,906
Girls who can have a serious conversation.

188
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,451
-Two more days, I think.
-That's right.

189
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,828
-Two more days until the break.
-Fall break.

190
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,623
-Oh, already?
-It's only a week, though.

191
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,374
-Only a week?
-Yeah.

192
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,336
-I thought it'd be two or three months.
-That's summer break.

193
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,130
When's your next...

194
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,675
You know, for this?
Is there an event or something?

195
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,679
This Friday, at an elementary school.

196
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,931
-Kaha...
-Kahala?

197
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,349
An elementary school.

198
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,351
-I think that's it.
-Friday?

199
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,312
-I'd like to come.
-Right? Can we come?

200
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,274
I'm sure you can. It's after school.

201
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,984
Will you ask?

202
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,365
Avian's really easy to talk to.

203
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,493
-Is she?
-Yeah.

204
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,079
The two of us were home today
before she left for work.

205
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,415
She was really easy to talk to.

206
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,251
It's fun talking with her.

207
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,504
She's really engaged in conversations.

208
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,881
Yeah, that's true.

209
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,718
We always laugh when we talk.

210
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,350
-Do you want some?
-What?

211
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,728
-That.
-The burger?

212
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,190
-I want one.
-Let's eat them since they're ready.

213
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,900
But isn't it for your lunch?

214
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,861
It is, but there'll be enough
left over for lunch.

215
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,657
Will you ask Yusuke if he wants one, too?

216
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,408
Sure, okay.

217
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,493
It's strangely stylish.

218
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,788
-A little disturbing.
-Thank you.

219
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,874
Oh, wow!

220
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,253
Is it hard?

221
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,880
Yeah, the meat's hard.

222
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,679
It's so hard.

223
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,639
It's definitely going to be
harder tomorrow.

224
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,725
I was just thinking that.

225
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,143
It's a man's meal.

226
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,688
-It works your jaw.
-Feels like I'm eating meat.

227
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,567
Do you talk to girls like you talk to us?

228
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,360
In the same way?

229
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,988
-Sort of?
-There hasn't been an issue.

230
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,824
-Finally.
-You seem okay.

231
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,200
You think so?

232
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,929
I made it on time.

233

00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,120
-Where's Eden Kai?
-Yes, Eden Kai.

239
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,960
I was just about to come to you.
Is that for me?

240
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,754
-Good job.
-Thank you.

241
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,132
Good job.

242
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,935
-Were you nervous?
-No, it was fun.

243
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,436
-You weren't nervous?
-No.

244
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,022
-You seemed happy.
-Like you were having fun.

245
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,774
You were smiling the whole time.

246
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:39,280
-You were totally different.
-Yeah, I'm different when I perform.

247
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,656
-I got goose bumps.
-Goose bumps?

248
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,992
I didn't realize you were that good.
It was crazy.

249
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,663
-Should we head home?
-Let's go home.

250
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,623
-Should we head back?
-Good job.

251
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,208
-Nice job!
-Thanks.

252
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,003
-Want me to hold one?
-That's all right.

253
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,839
-Should we meet at home?
-What should we eat?

254
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,425
-We should eat out.
-Let's eat out.

255
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,053
-But Lauren's eating with her grandma.
-Yeah, with my grandma.

256
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,638
-Oh, really?
-So maybe it's better we go home first.

257
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,981
-Bye!
-See you at home.

258
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,194
Will we fit?

259
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,702
-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit!

260
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,873
So you don't get nervous when you play?

261
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,082
Not really.

262
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,500
I just enjoy it.

263
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,419
-You just enjoy it?
-Yeah.

264
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,754
Why did you start playing?

265
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,050
I was in a brass band.

266
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,886
In junior high school,
I played the trombone.

267
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,348
I came to love it.

268
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,354
But I wanted an instrument
that could express my music better.

269
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:58,109
I thought the guitar could work,
so I checked out YouTube.

270
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,904
I watched the videos there
and decided I'd do it.

271
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,242
It started out as a hobby.

272
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,494
But since I moved here, I really...

273
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,622
-Got into it?
-Yeah, I became passionate about it.

274
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,959
You learned ukulele
just by watching YouTube, right?

275
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,919
-Yeah.
-Really?

276
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,880
-I taught myself.
-I see.

277
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,846
Here I go.

278
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,100
You're up early.

279
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,684
Super early.

280
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,776
I haven't gotten up this early in a while
unless I'm going surfing.

281
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,319
That's true.

282
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,323
-Feels like I'm back in school.
-Yeah.

283
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,827
I have class from 8:20 a.m.,

284
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,787
until about 3:00 p.m.

285
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,082
Until about 3:00 p.m. starting today.

286
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,043
-Seriously?
-Yeah, every day.

287
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:02,006
But I end at noon on Fridays
because it's Happy Friday.

288
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,638
I'm supposed to meet
my other classmates today.

289
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,557
-About 30 people.
-Really?

290
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,350
Yeah, they said there are a lot.

291
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,687
From Brazil, Saudi Arabia...

292
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,773
-Sounds like you'll make a lot of friends.
-Yeah.

293
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,443
-I'm going.
-Okay.

294
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,361
-Good luck.
-I didn't finish my coffee.

295
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,446
Don't worry, I'll drink it.

296
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,997
-Good luck, Yuya.
-Thanks.

297
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,583
See you!

298
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,628
-See you.
-Bye.

299
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,047
-What are you doing?
-There he is.

300
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,217
-The guys--
-You're eating cereal? At this hour?

301
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,719
-What? Why?
-No, I'm not complaining.

302
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,596
-Is that not okay?
-It's fine.

303
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,809
Your painting... Where is that?

304
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,769
What's it a scene of?

305
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,230
Where is this?

306
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,899
Some Chinatown somewhere.

307
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,568
Oh, Chinatown.

308
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,196
Amazing. How many did you do today?

309
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,740
Two. This is the third.

310
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,242
-The third?
-Seriously?

311
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,911
-Crazy.
-I have to work hard.

312
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,083
Why are you doing a different style today?

313
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,961
I want to submit my work to a gallery.

314
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,588
So I have to...

315
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,259
I have to work hard,
or nothing will happen.

316
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,928
-Like, my dreams.
-That's true.

317
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,931
What are you doing this week, Yusuke?

318
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,727
I don't have any plans.

319
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,979
Are you going to work on your music?

320
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,691
I do that every day,

321
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,778
just like you draw every day to improve.

322
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,030
Yeah, every day.

323
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:19,620
You can't continue
if you aren't passionate.

324
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,123
That's true.

325
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,750
Continue talking.

326
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,294
Why?

327
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,629
Where are you going?

328
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,466
-To the room. I'm going to call a friend.
-Oh, I see.

329
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,596
How are things lately?

330
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,348
Really good.

331
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,269
I get to see my sister and my grandma.

332
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,354
I really like my job.

333
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,691
And I like living here
and making friends with everyone.

334
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,068
-Is it really fun? You're okay?
-It's fun.

335
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,364
It can be stressful at times,
but I think that's normal.

336
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,785
You can speak in English
when you're struggling.

337
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,872
Yeah, my Japanese...

338
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:09,170
I want to improve,
but I can't communicate what I'm thinking.

339
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,507
So sometimes I don't speak.

340
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,927
Or when I do,
I'm worried that I sound stupid.

341
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,640
I don't think you have to worry
about that.

342
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,267
Thank you.

343
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,314
When I first moved here,
I couldn't speak English at all.

344
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,778
Back then, I sounded really stupid
when I spoke.

345
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,198
But you really don't...

346
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,243
At least the people here don't care.

347
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,871
Thanks for worrying about me.

348
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,379
Tomorrow?

349
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:57,092
What should I do?
I haven't decided. I might...

350
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,679
Maybe I'll hang out with friends.

351
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,932
I'm totally free.

352
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,060
-Really free.
-Yeah.

353
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,020
When's your day off?

354
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:17,529
Let me see, I'm off Friday and Saturday
this week.

355
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,449
And...

356
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,118
Thursday evening, too.

357
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,454
-I'm free.
-Nice.

358
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,916
Should we all go to North Shore?

359
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,503
-North Shore?
-Everyone keeps talking about it.

360
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,923
-Oh, yeah.
-Like, "Let's go to North Shore."

361
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,259
They were saying that.

362
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,802
-I was saying it, too.
-Yeah.

363
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,971
-I think it'll be fun.
-Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

364
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,681
Saturday?

365
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,683
-Saturday?
-Saturday.

366
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,934
Okay.

367
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,187
Are you going to paint for a while?

368
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,066
I won't bother you then.

369
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,610
-Not at all.
-I'll go.

370
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,448
See you.

371
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,492
-Good night.
-Good night.

372
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,545
Lauren, please ask him more.

373
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,548
-Because he can't, and he's a virgin.
-Well, but...

374
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,302
-He tried.
-He tried.

375
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,263
His mind is as good as
his ukulele playing.

376
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,684
He's really playing it.

377
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,353
-All around...
-He's hitting it.

378
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,021
He's hitting it!

379
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,649
-Playing and hitting.
-Playing and hitting.

380
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,651
But he can't bring himself to ask.

381
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,695
And Lauren, too.

382
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,573
She wants to ask, but...

383
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:46,868
"Let's all go to North Shore"
was the best she could do.

384
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,622
-And for Yusuke, it's "Oh, with everyone."
-Yes, of course.

385
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:55,126
But it felt like a conversation between
18 year olds. It was cute.

386
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,046
And they're both talented. It's so great.

387
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,090
It's the first time
I'm cheering for a couple.

388
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,719
And the way he left,
saying "I don't want to bother you."

389
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,637
-She said, "Not at all."
-Right?

390
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,850
I don't think God will know what to do
with that information.

391
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,020
That was so uncalled for.

392
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,481
You're so annoying.

393
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,443
Why do you say stuff like that?

394
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:24,573
When Lauren called out Eric
and they talked about hugging,

395
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,285
she said she normally doesn't hug
and wanted to have coffee instead.

396
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,913
-But she gave Yusuke a hug.
-That's true!

397
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,208
So that hug had some meaning.

398
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,169
Yusuke placed his ukulele
in front of him right after.

399
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,466
-Which ukulele?
-There's only one ukulele!

400
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,217
-The instrument.
-Oh, the instrument.

401
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,386
There's only one ukulele!

402
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,597
He'll have the ukulele in front,
and suddenly you'll hear a sound.

403
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,599
He's getting out of control.

404
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,100
You'll hear it crack.

405
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,687
Quiet, you!

406
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,188
He played it!

407
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,524
He didn't play it.

408
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,527
-The ukulele played the ukulele!
-Torichan!

409
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,823
School finally started.

410
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,326
-What happened with the girl?
-Which girl?

411
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,995
-The Japanese girl.
-The really forward one?

412
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,874
The one I told you about?
We didn't really talk today.

413
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,503
It's nice that you can meet people.

414
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,757
-That's true.
-I don't get to.

415
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,177
Avian and I have been talking
a lot lately.

416
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,303
Seriously?

417
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,347
Like, "What are you up to?"
Something like that.

418
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,727
-I plan to get her.
-Seriously?

419
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,898
-It's easy to be with her?
-It is.

420
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,567
I'm pretty...

421
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,071
You've been close to Naomi lately.

422
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,449
-Me and Naomi? Really?
-Yeah.

423
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,659
It seems like you pick on her a lot.

424
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,288
-You both pick on her.
-Yeah, I do, too.

425
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,748
-You?
-What?

426
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,333
Do you like anyone here?

427
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,211
Is there anyone you want to hang out with
on your own?

428
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,923
Yeah, like go out
and have something happen.

429
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:11,638
At first, it wasn't like this at all,
but when I was talking to Lauren...

430
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,683
-it felt really natural.
-Oh, Lauren.

431
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,020
You're choosing the cutest one.

432
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,567
-You're just attracted to her looks.
-Let me just say that that's not it.

433
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,319
What do you like about Lauren?

434
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:30,574
I like how she finds inspiration.

435
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,119
-As a musician?
-Tonight, too.

436
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,913
When we were talking,
she said when she draws,

437
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,542
she sometime listens to music
and draws inspiration from it.

438
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,377
You know her well.

439
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,714
The two of you have been talking a lot.

440
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,718
Oh, that thing on Saturday. What is it?

441
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,094
Where is it?

442
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,263
-Ah, North Shore?
-North Shore.

443
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,807
Lauren's coming to that.

444
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,519
-Yeah, she said she would.
-Yeah.

445
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,604
You should bring your ukulele.

446
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,691
-Bring it all the way there?
-Yusuke, we'll just be...

447
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,694
watching over you from afar.

448
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,696
I see. Well, I'll think about it.

449
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,866
Don't overthink it.

450
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,118
-If you overthink it...
-That's true.

451
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,078
You'll explode if you overthink.

452
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,622
It'll become awkward.

453
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,751
I'm looking forward to it.

454
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,754
-Right?
-Yeah.
