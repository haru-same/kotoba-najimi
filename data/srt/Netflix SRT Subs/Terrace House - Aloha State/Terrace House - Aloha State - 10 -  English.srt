1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,056
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,393
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,270
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,523
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,442
There is no script at all.

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,612
The time has finally come.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,907
After what happened last episode...

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,117
-What happened?
-Last time...

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,539
-Yusuke said he's thinking of leaving.
-That's right.

10
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,290
Wasn't that what happened?

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,459
-He only told Naomi.
-Right.

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,543
-Yes.
-That's right.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,797
-Yes, it was a double shock.
-The other members don't know yet.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,925
-Only Naomi knows right now.
-That's right.

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,176
Wait a second!

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,514
Who are you?

17
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:58,100
Excuse me. I'm Saito.

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,229
-I didn't recognize you!
-Saito!

19
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,982
-I've got this on today.
-That hides 90% of you.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,191
TSUKASA SAITO
TRENDY ANGEL

21
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,735
90%? Only one tenth.

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:12,405
-Why are you here today?
-I really love Terrace House.

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,118
So I used my popularity,
told people how much I love it,

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,327
and then I was invited.

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,665
-Yay!
-I'm honored. I'm honestly very nervous.

26
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,459
Recently, I worked with Takeshi Kitano
and Ken Shimura,

27
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,378
but this is even more nerve-wracking.

28
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,673
You're making them feel bad.

29
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,926
I feel like I can't disturb this scene.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,013
It's like getting my picture taken
at Disneyland.

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,723
It's at that level.

32
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,058
Have you been a fan since the beginning?

33
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,518
Yes, I have.

34
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,481
Do you have any favorite people or scenes?

35
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,566
Well, to be honest...

36
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:54,531
I've been asked in interviews
whether I've ever cried before.

37
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:59,703
The scene when Hansan is about to leave...

38
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,414
That's the most I've cried in my life.

39
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,332
-You're kidding!
-Your entire life?

40
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,168
-You too, right?
-Me too!

41
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,252
These two cried, too.

42
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,046
-You're right!
-Yes, it's true.

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,800
I wondered why the rest of you
weren't crying.

44
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,259
It was touching, right?

45
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,970
That was the most moved you felt
in your entire life?

46
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,681
-No way.
-It's the truth.

47
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,850
I downloaded that scene and have it saved.

48
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,102
-It's on your phone?
-So I can watch it any time.

49
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,897
-No way!
-You understand the greatness of Hansan.

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,482
For us, it's like, why did he come?

51
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,444
-It was so great, wasn't it?
-It was.

52
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,154
How about this season?

53
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,740
I love Lauren.

54
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,325
Really? You like Lauren?

55
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,661
I thought I wouldn't
since she seems so perfect,

56
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,039
but she's been showing
some vulnerability lately.

57
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,540
Her true self, you mean.

58
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,168
Yes. Well, that's a bad choice of words.

59
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,253
-Watch out for him. Careful.
-Yes.

60
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:55,968
Because of that,
she's slipped into my zone.

61
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,428
-She was on a pedestal...
-That's exactly right.

62
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,473
-...but became human.
-I feel like I might have a chance.

63
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,435
-She's been stressed out lately.
-That's right.

64
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,187
Sparks flew last time.

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,983
-Because Lauren...
-Oh, Thanksgiving.

66
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,820
I know you want to spend time
with your family.

67
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,824
We can have our dinner earlier.

68
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,285
I might get in trouble, but okay.
That can't be helped.

69
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,705
Then don't tell us you'll be in trouble.

70
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:41,054
Many people felt that she should've
just changed her schedule to begin with.

71
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,224
That's not true at all.

72
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,895
And then for her to say she's stressed.
Is that our fault?

73
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,731
And Naomi's farewell trip...

74
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,775
-They went snorkeling.
-That was nice.

75
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,068
Avian's bottom was very attractive.

76
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,946
-She does have a nice bottom.
-She does.

77
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,701
And between Yuya and Avian...

78
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,538
things have been going well.

79
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,331
Are your feet ticklish?

80
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,252
Stop that! Seriously.

81
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,129
I'm sleepy.

82
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,882
-On the sofa outside.
-That's right.

83
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,469
-They should've kissed.
-Yes.

84
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,597
-But he didn't make a move.
-He didn't.

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,724
And Yusuke will also be leaving
Terrace House...

86
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:30,353
-Only Naomi knows.
-He only told Naomi.

87
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,023
You're leaving
Terrace House tomorrow, right?

88
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,276
I'm thinking of leaving soon, too.

89
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,862
-Shall we watch, Saito?
-It's gonna start.

90
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,613
Thank you. Finally!

91
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,335
Naomi, I have to go.

92
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,212
Okay, I'll see you out.

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,256
The last time.

94
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,638
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

95
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,976
-Sorry I can't see you off.
-That's all right.

96
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,190
-Here.
-Good luck in Japan.

97
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,740
See you.

98
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,744
See you.

99
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,375
You're going to be late, Yusuke.

100
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,669
Go. Don't worry about me.

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,214
Don't worry about me. You'll be late.

102
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,842
Okay.

103
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,888
Have a good day.

104
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,516
Good luck.

105
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,684
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

106
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,312
Good luck.

107
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,232
Keep in touch.

108
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,277
Good luck. Have a good day.

109
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,280
-I'm off.
-Bye.

110
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,245
I'm off.

111
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,497
Good luck.

112
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,833
-Good luck!
-Thanks.

113
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,507
-See you.
-See you.

114
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,182
-I'm off!
-Have a good one.

115
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,766
-See you!
-Bye!

116
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,363
NEW SONG
INTRO

117
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,141
-It's better when it's bigger.
-Really?

118
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,768
-The pop-up opens on the 10th?
-The 10th.

119
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,021
-Can I come?
-Come! Of course.

120
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,065
Okay, I'll come.

121
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,194
Having someone to collaborate with
on Terrace House...

122
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,655
I was hoping for that.

123
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,907
-You're glad?
-I'm really glad.

124
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,701
I'm glad, but...

125
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,874
It's so quiet now.

126
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,543
No one's home when I get back.

127
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,673
Not to further put a damper or anything...

128
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:53,056
but now that we've collaborated
and the pop-up is opening...

129
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,684
I've finished what I set out to do.

130
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,981
So after this...

131
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,775
I'm leaving.

132
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,659
I think there'll be more opportunities...

133
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,870
once I open the pop-up.

134
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,914
-And you'll have your café?
-Yes.

135
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,833
-You're going to open one in Tokyo, too?
-Yes.

136
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,712
I'm sure we'll work together again
in the future.

137
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,339
Yeah.

138
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,844
I was hoping to meet someone
who would inspire me.

139
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,930
So I'm really glad I met you.

140
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,890
I'm glad I met you, too.

141
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,019
You're probably
the easiest member to talk to.

142
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,770
-Really?
-Yeah.

143
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,105
That makes me happy.

144
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,069
It's been really fun.

145
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,279
It really has been...

146
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,655
this experience.

-You're really leaving?
-Yeah.

155
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,504
I don't want you to. Really?

156
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,593
It's good timing.

157
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,512
I want to open the main café, too.

158
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,390
I want to focus on that more.

159
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,268
-Let's eat!
-Let's eat, let's eat.

160
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:06,148
When I'm with you, it's like I'm 18 again.

161
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,402
It's both good and bad.

162
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,779
Yeah.

163
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,449
I have the most fun hanging out with you.

164
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,286
We're probably similar.

165
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,996
Yeah.

166
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,624
You know how...

167
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,671
I said I was interested in Lauren?

168
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,881
The age difference is significant...

169
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,926
and we work together.

170
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:40,515
So I don't want things to get complicated.

171
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,811
And Yusuke went out on a date with her.

172
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,647
I think it was better...

173
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,775
that he went out with her rather than me.

174
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,073
What are you going to do
if the new girl is really cute?

175
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:02,036
Well, I really like Avian right now...

176
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,497
so I don't think it would matter.

177
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
Nice.

178
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,836
She's probably the least pretty
of the three.

179
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,923
But after talking with her
and getting to know her...

180
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,259
she's really pretty to me.

181
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,262
She's like an older sister,

182
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,056
but she can still put herself in my shoes.

183
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,767
And sometimes she'll teach me things.

184
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:29,522
-She affects me in different ways.
-That's good.

185
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm glad we did this.
It's been a while.

186
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,029
-Let's still meet up even after you leave.
-Yeah, let's.

187
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,292
LOUKIE WONG
AVIAN'S MOTHER

188
00:11:54,964 --> 00:12:00,470
HENRY CHAN
MERCHANDISING DIRECTOR

189
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,955
Hey.

190
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,084
How are you?

191
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,212
We said we'd come see the sunset,
but it's totally dark.

192
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,715
It's totally night time now.

193
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,886
This is nice, too.
There are even Christmas decorations.

194
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,930
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

195
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,601
It's delicious.

196
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,021
You look different today.

197
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,065
Is that a compliment? Thanks.

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,694
-Is that a compliment?
-No, it's not.

199
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,950
This is really good.

200
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,705
You seem happy.

201
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,375
The food is good,
and I'm having dinner with you.

202
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,005
-Yeah.
-How was the talk?

203
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,758
-Good?
-It was.

204
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,596
-We talked about starting a bikini line.
-You did?

205
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,558
What did your mom say?
Was she surprised?

206
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,059
She agreed with me.

207
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,811
Would the brand...

208
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,981
be part of 88 Tees?

209
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,900
No, it'll be my own thing.

210
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,070
-I'll come up with a name.
-I see.

211
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,867
People always ask if I'm taking over.

212
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,285
When they do, it makes me feel...

213
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,746
-You don't like it?
-No.

214
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,583
I feel the pressure.
So I can't picture it now, but...

215
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,293
-But?
-When the time is right.

216
00:13:56,378 --> 00:14:00,214
You're working at your mom's store...

217
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,174
but you have your way
of doing things, too.

218
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,263
So you should work on developing that.

219
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,808
Even if the bikini line fails...

220
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,144
I think you'd succeed with anything.

221
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,397
Of course,
succeeding with the bikini line is best.

222
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah.

223
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,778
-I'll be rooting for you.
-Thanks.

224
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,615
You're an active guy.

225
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,909
We're alike in that way.

226
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,788
We are.

227
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,706
It's partially why I was attracted to you.

228
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,584
Really? Because I'm active?

229
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,880
-Active people--
-I like girls I can work out with.

230
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,090
I see.

231
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,765
Wait, hold on...

232
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,941
Have you dated someone active before?

233
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,777
There has never been anyone
I could work out with.

234
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,903
I see.

235
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,072
I've never gone surfing
with a girl before.

236
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,909
Go ahead, eat.

237
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,661
I'll peel this.

238
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,663
Is it good?

239
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,373
-Good?
-Yeah.

240
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,466
-Are you full?
-We ate a lot.

241
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,724
How much?

242
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,601
I have...

243
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,860
Seriously.

244
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,987
Seriously, seriously, seriously.

245
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,578
Thank you.

246
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,669
Naomi left just like that.

247
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,673
Please pick up on what happened.

248
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,927
I'm sure they all talked at the table,

249
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,179
and they gave her a card.

250
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,265
Think about it as you watch.

251
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:18,352
Don't accept everything
at face value.

252
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,271
But it took her two and a half minutes
to leave.

253
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,775
How long have you been in television?

254
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,735
You can fall in love in two minutes.

255
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,865
-Who's talking big?
-Me, Saito.

256
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,286
And we got to hear Saito sing.

257
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,872
-Yes, during the opening.
-Yes.

258
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,916
How can you not sing along?

259
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,841
-I'm hearing it behind me and in my ears.
-It's stereo sound.

260
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,975
I wonder if Yusuke will write songs
about his experiences at Terrace House.

261
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,062
Something like,
"I cried salty tears over catfish."

262
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,105
Do you think he'll use the catfish?

263
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,984
The catfish I was supposed
To share with you

264
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,695
That's so lame!

265
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,489
It was a little too big
To have on my own

266
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,616
Nice!

267
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,535
Is it a folk song?

268
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:22,291
-It's a folk song.
-Like in the style of Kosetsu Minami.

269
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,086
-Oh, and Eric!
-Right?

270
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,756
He's the older brother figure.

271
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,552
The timing is right for him, isn't it?

272
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,305
Yuya made a pretty shocking comment
during their talk.

273
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,932
Hey.

274
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,560
I was stunned.

275
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,313
What did he say exactly?
I wasn't listening.

276
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,733
"She's not the prettiest of the three."

277
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,944
Does he really need to say that?

278
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,907
He's not a bad kid,
but his choice of words

279
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,118
-is too careless.
-Yes.

280
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,246
-It's hurtful.
-His words are too naked.

281
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,790
-Too blunt.
-Yes, too blunt.

282
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:06,543
He was just trying to say
she's fun and has a great personality,

283
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:11,215
and used those words with that purpose,
at least in his mind.

284
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,343
It's like "Not A, but B,"
like in textbooks.

285
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,471
-That's right.
-That's right.

286
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,682
-It's the real life version.
-That's right.

287
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,434
The switch after that was good.

288
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,646
He said he likes girls who work out.

289
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,732
-Then he said, "It's you," in English.
-That was good.

290
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,817
I think I'll use it next time.

291
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,236
-You will?
-Yeah, it was nice.

292
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,531
It's embarrassing to say, "I love you."

293
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,492
It's like how Soseki Natsume wrote,
"The moon is beautiful."

294
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,370
-How he translated "I love you."
-Yes, it was like that.

295
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,998
-Where?
-Seriously.

296
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,500
He hid his shyness
by switching to English.

297
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,252
What is this baldy talking about?

298
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,422
-What? I'm not bald today, Yamachan.
-Let's see, let's see.

299
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,301
-The moon is beautiful.
-Is it?

300
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,552
The moon is beautiful.

301
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,722
So your head is saying "I love you."

302
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,973
Yes, excuse me.

303
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,934
-There's the flip.
-Excuse me.

304
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,273
Well, there's a reason why I called
everyone here today.

305
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,484
-I wrote a song.
-Oh, really?

306
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,737
So I wanted you to hear it.

307
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,572
-Yeah.
-Wow.

308
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,304
Looking up
There stood a house of emerald stone

309
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,473
I took a step forward
Opened the door

310
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,475
And there were unfamiliar faces

311
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,688
Imagining my new life with the faces

312
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,858
I stared at the views outside

313
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,818
I had no faith in myself

314
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,862
I put on bravado

315
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,782
I've always gotten along with everyone

316
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,868
But after rethinking

317
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,120
And repeating and repeating

318
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,499
I've become my true self

319
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:28,644
I've become honest
And experienced more

320
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,148
Lived through the same moments with you

321
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,441
I want to thank you

322
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,236
I want to tell you that

323
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,322
My story

324
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,741
Still continues

325
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,352
It's about Terrace House, right?

326
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,437
-The lyrics?
-Yes.

327
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
What I wanted to say...

328
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,234
is that I'm thinking of leaving.

329
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,445
-Seriously?
-What?

330
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,488
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

331
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,866
No way!

332
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,744
After I open the pop-up store...

333
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,207
I'm leaving, too.

334
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,043
-When it's done.
-Wait, wait. What?

335
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,301
When did you decide, Yusuke?

336
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,304
When Naomi said she was leaving.

337
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,806
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

338
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,557
-So early?
-When you two talked?

339
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,561
Me, too.

340
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:58,025
I felt like the timing was right
for me to take the next step.

341
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,821
Let's work hard.

342
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,614
Let's work hard.

343
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,525
When are you leaving tomorrow, Yusuke?

344
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,654
-10:00? 11:00?
-Probably around 10:00.

345
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,739
-Maybe 11:00.
-Okay.

346
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,324
I'm going to miss you.

347
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:16,038
You, too.
Is there only another week or so?

348
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,456
About nine days.

349
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,460
Thank you for cooking, Lauren and Eric.

350
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,879
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

351
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,845
-Your parents are picking you up?
-Yeah.

352
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,266
I already know Eric's,

353
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,060
but what is everyone else's goal?

354
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:43,774
I've already mentioned it,
but I have a gallery show on January 2nd.

355
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,858
Really?

356
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,277
-I'm going.
-It's been decided?

357
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,238
Yes! Did I not tell you?

358
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,406
I didn't know.

359
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,286
-I told everyone it'll be at ARS Café.
-Around here?

360
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,496
-In Japan?
-Near Diamond Head.

361
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,999
-I see.
-On Monsarrat Avenue.

362
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,793
-So it'll be just your art?
-Just mine.

363
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,586
-That's amazing, isn't it?
-Wow.

364
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,672
Isn't a solo show uncommon?

365
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:11,135
Maybe, but it's only for two days.

366
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,389
I'd love to have my own concert, too.

367
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:20,686
Let me know if you're going to have one.
I would go.

368
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,897
Based on the way you were
before Terrace House

369
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,275
and the way you are now,
do you feel different?

370
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,654
I feel like the hesitation
is totally gone.

371
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,864
-Toward other people?
-Yeah.

372
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,991
I can say what's on my mind.

373
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,913
What would you say to your old self?

374
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,082
Talk.

375
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,542
-Talk?
-Yeah.

376
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,044
Stop hesitating.

377
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,520
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

378
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,523
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

379
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,445
Delicious.

380
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,281
Who made this?

381
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,532
-Yuya!
-Seriously?

382
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,910
-Yuya's scrambled eggs.
-It's really good.

383
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,206
-Seriously?
-We made this.

384
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,291
Seriously?

385
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,752
It makes me really happy.

386
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,588
-Let's hang out again.
-Yeah.

387
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,341
Keep in touch.

388
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,178
Thanks.

389
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,058
Well...

390
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,812
I'll get going then.

391
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,941
Thank you for the food.

392
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,986
-Thank you.
-Thanks for the food.

393
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,622
Bye.

394
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:11,880
Bye! See you!

395
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,310
How are you, Avian?

396
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,188
With Yuya?

397
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,065
There's a big age difference.

398
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,027
-Yeah.
-How many years? Nine?

399
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,323
-Eight.
-Do you feel the difference?

400
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,879
It really bothered me in the beginning.

401
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,676
But it's fun to hang out.

402
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,930
I've stopped thinking about it.

403
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,936
Does Yuya talk about me?

404
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,688
Yeah, he does.

405
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,773
Like what? Am I allowed to ask?

406
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,024
Sure.

407
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:17,195
He talks about his feelings for you.

408
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,241
How does he feel about me?

409
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,368
I can't go into detail.

410
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,496
Why not?

411
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,749
-Why not?
-You can ask Yuya directly.

412
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,251
Directly?

413
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:34,004
-That's pretty tough.
-Why?

414
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,466
It'll cause trouble
if I miscommunicate anything.

415
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,386
I'm scared.

416
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,096
-About what?
-Asking him how he feels.

417
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,515
I'm not sure.

418
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,435
And there's going to be a new girl coming,
so I'm really scared.

419
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,604
That he might be into the new girl?

420
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,607
Yuya has...

421
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,192
pretty strong feelings for you.

422
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,069
Definitely.

423
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,829
I'm going to live at the Terrace House.

424
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,207
Wait, wait.

425
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,044
-Yeah.
-Really?

426
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,467
I thought I should tell you
since we live together.

427
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,053
I told you I applied, right?

428
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,971
You mentioned it.

429
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:30,101
-What made you decide to go?
-What made me?

430
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:35,566
-I've gotten used to the life in Hawaii.
-That's true.

431
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,192
To everything.

432
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:41,780
-It'll be something totally new.
-That's true.

433
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,409
Right? I hope I meet someone!

434
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,079
What kind of person
are you looking to meet?

435
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,081
I've been really into surfing lately.

436
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,335
So someone I could surf with would be nice
since I always go alone.

437
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,837
Muscular and tanned.

438
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:27,326
Mr. Shige, I've got something to tell you.

439
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:32,038
I know I'm quitting rather abruptly,

440
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:36,335
but I've been accepted
to the show Terrace House.

441
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,589
It's my dream to succeed
as an actor in Hollywood.

442
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:45,176
I'm currently getting a steady stream
of jobs in LA,

443
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,098
so to have to leave LA right now
is a risky move for me.

444
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:55,729
But for me to continue as an actor,

445
00:30:55,812 --> 00:31:01,192
I think I need to experience
being deeply in love.

446
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,113
I want to have this experience
while I'm in my twenties.

447
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,491
It's been 30 years since I came to the US.

448
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,619
Working in this business,

449
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,623
I've met many waiters
who are trying to make it as actors.

450
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,625
From them, you're one of the most serious.

451
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,962
You should do what you can now.
I'm sure the next step will follow.

452
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,589
You should work hard.

453
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:27,343
If you should fail, feel free to call me.

454
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,471
-Thank you.
-I'm happy to lend an ear.

455
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:34,309
I'll be going to Hawaii to fall in love
for the last year of my twenties.

456
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,145
-Thank you!
-Thank you for your work.

457
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,314
-Did you hear what he said?
-He's 29.

458
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,650
"I'm going to Hawaii to fall in love."

459
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,154
-I can't wait!
-It's time for you too, Yamasato.

460
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,281
The love of a lifetime?

461
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,743
Go experience
the love of a lifetime in LA.

462
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,870
Only Ayabe's there.

463
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,835
Yusuke's announcement went as expected.

464
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,920
I want to see the lyrics.

465
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,423
-It was a little quick.
-It was fast.

466
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,091
It was a great song.

467
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,053
-He was like Scatman John at the start.
-Yeah, his tempo was.

468
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,639
He wasn't like that at all!

469
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,851
Eric didn't tell Avian...

470
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,479
-Of course not!
-Who would?

471
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:23,108
It was the perfect opportunity
for Eric to gain some points.

472
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,152
-In your view.
-Yes, in my view.

473
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,322
Like, "He said you were the least pretty."

474
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,326
It's not "Yay."

475
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,996
Seina would've definitely told her.

476
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,373
That's true.
Seina may have said it.

477
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,458
Yeah, certainly.

478
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,085
Like, "I'm saying this for your sake."

479
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,087
She would've said something.

480
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,673
Avian seems to have really fallen for him.

481
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,301
-She really likes him.
-It just happened.

482
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:55,431
At first she was like a big sister,
almost rooting for Naomi's feelings.

483
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:59,645
The age difference bothered her and
she said she couldn't keep up with him.

484
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,354
-But it happened.
-It did.

485
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,690
I don't understand women.

486
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,567
-Even you don't understand women?
-I don't.

487
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,569
No matter how many times I fall in love...

488
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,195
I agree.

489
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,823
I always discover something new.

490
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,659
And you?

491
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,912
I haven't reached your level,
so I can't say.

492
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,122
I live on air.

493
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,625
-You're a wizard?
-I am.

494
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,877
More so than Tokui?

495
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,212
When you're at Saito's level...

496
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,632
Yes, very much so.

497
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,050
Come back to reality.

498
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,344
He caught a cold!

499
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,891
-That makes you sick?
-So quickly?

500
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,144
I can see why he's popular
with the ladies.

501
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,689
-He's very popular!
-Really? Really?

502
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,569
-I was thinking what the difference is.
-From me?

503
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,822
-Why you aren't popular.
-Me?

504
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,281
You choose to go...

505
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,826
to the unpopular side.

506
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,411
-I see.
-That's his professionalism.

507
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,705
I see.

508
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,331
-You should take it easy.
-Be quiet!

509
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,712
He gets sick so quickly.

510
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,172
I'm gonna make you sick, damn it!

511
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,757
You're gonna make him sick?

512
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,887
Avian is realizing
how much she likes Yuya.

513
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:21,142
But when she thinks
about the fact that he's 18,

514
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:25,981
she must be like, "What am I doing?"

515
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,234
But they haven't told each other
how they feel.

516
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,778
Just as they're about to get together,

517
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:37,408
a new girl who seems to be Yuya's type
appears at just the right time.

518
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,452
She loves to surf...

519
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,832
She's got wavy hair like a surfer.

520
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,587
I think he'll go for her
if she's exactly his type.

521
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,590
But you never know.
What about the guy from LA?

522
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,925
Didn't he say this is the last year
of his twenties?

523
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,802
That makes him 29.

524
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,804
An older guy.

525
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:02,183
-He wants success in Hollywood.
-Like Yuya, he's trying to be an actor.

526
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,228
-She might go for him.
-She may like him better.

527
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:09,565
Or maybe Lauren will become interested.

528
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,110
-His face...
-I wonder what kind of person he is.

529
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,696
Either they'll show his face at the end,

530
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,616
or he'll come in,
but they'll only show him up to here.

531
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,911
It's going to be the latter.

532
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,121
As usual.

533
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,998
It's Saito's first experience.

534
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,750
-My first.
-That's exciting.

535
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,877
I'd like to enjoy the moment, yes.

536
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,272
We have a doorbell?

537
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,482
Open it.

538
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,070
We'll wait.

539
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,863
This is kind of embarrassing.

540
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,953
-Hello.
-Hello.

541
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,455
-Come in.
-Yes, thank you.

542
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,750
-I'm Yuya.
-I'm Anna. Nice to meet you.

543
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,252
-Should I take off my shoes?
-Leave your bags here.

544
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:16,382
-Hello.
-Hello.

545
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,135
It's nice to meet you. I'm Anna.

546
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,721
Nice to meet you. I'm Lauren.

547
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,138
-Lauren?
-Yes.

548
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,556
Nice to meet you. I'm Avian.

549
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,101
Avian? Nice to meet you.

550
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,518
What should I do? Can I sit here?

551
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,814
-Sure, anywhere is fine.
-Please, sit wherever you'd like.

552
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,733
-Whichever chair you like.
-Thanks.

553
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,527
Welcome to Terrace House.

554
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,364
-Are you from Hawaii?
-No, I'm from Japan.

555
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,866
Japan?

556
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,535
-But you live in Hawaii?
-It's been about three years.

557
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,704
Three years?

558
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,163
How old are you?

559
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,374
-I'm 22.
-22?

560
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,709
What do you do?

561
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:55,296
I work here, but I came as a student.
I work now.

562
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,798
Where?

563
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,800
At the sandbar. Do you know it?

564
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,385
-I know the sandbar!
-Yes.

565
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,222
-It's where you go in the ocean...
-Yes, in a boat,

566
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,808
and the sand comes up.

567
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,603
-It's beautiful.
-Yes, very beautiful.

568
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,231
I also work at a restaurant
in Ala Moana Center.

569
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,482
ANNA HANEISHI, 22 YEARS OLD
PART-TIMER

570
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,235
It's in the basement floor of Ala Moana.

571
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,904
I see.

572
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,072
What kind of guy is your type?

573
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,283
Well, I surf.

574
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,700
Do you?

575
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,495
I've only been doing it for two years.

576
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,040
-You must be really good.
-Not at all.

577
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:34,044
So I'd like someone I can surf with
because I always go alone.

578
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,047
-Then you've got friends.
-Really?

579
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,132
-We go often.
-Really?

580
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,926
Where do you usually surf?

581
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,719
-I usually go to Diamond Head.
-Diamond Head?

582
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,597
That's where Eric usually goes.

583
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,558
We go, too.

584
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:54,064
Oh, there's one more member.
His name is Eric. He's 27.

585
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,483
-He should be home in the evening.
-Really?

586
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,447
I'd like someone I can go surfing with.

587
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,241
-Let's go together.
-Yeah, let's go! I'm glad.

588
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,160
I always go by myself.

589
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,466
You already seem
like you're a local Hawaiian.

590
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,844
-Yeah, somehow.
-You look very local.

591
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,096
People always say my
Japanese is good.

592
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,390
I didn't expect to stay in Hawaii
for so long.

593
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,768
I thought I'd stay
for no more than two years.

594
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,645
But I love it here...

595
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,941
so I can't leave.

596
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,788
Do you--

597
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,960
-I'll go.
-Eric!

598
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,170
Eric?

599
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,505
-What?
-No way!

600
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,590
Seriously?
