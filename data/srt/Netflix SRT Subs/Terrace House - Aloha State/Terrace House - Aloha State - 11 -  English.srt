1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,681
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:18,143
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,978
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,315
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,276
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,612
Saito will be hosting with us today again.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,697
Hi, I'm Saito.
I watched Your Name once,

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,741
but Terrace House twice.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,494
-The movie version?
-Yes.

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,913
-Wow!
-That's amazing.

11
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,790
Should we review what happened?

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,544
Naomi and Yusuke,
who were very entertaining,

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,339
have now left.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,050
-I think I need to step in now.
-You don't.

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,052
It's none of your business.

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,222
Eric also announced that he's leaving.

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,264
Explain it right!

18
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,811
-He'll catch a cold. Hurry! Get his hat!
-Hurry!

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,021
Do that once more
and I'll get the flu!

20
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:08,360
Now that we've collaborated
and the pop-up is opening...

21
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,155
I've finished what I set out to do.

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,323
So after this...

23
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,407
I'm leaving.

24
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,328
All we've seen of his project are
graphics of a shack spinning.

25
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,497
So he'll leave once it's completed.

26
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,876
Yuya and Avian are getting
closer and closer.

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,043
They like each other.

28
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,629
They went on a date.

29
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,505
There was a cool scene.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,925
-Active people--
-I like girls I can work out with.

31
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,343
I see.

32
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,931
Wait, hold on...

33
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,728
He said, "It's you."

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,606
-That was so cool!
-The two of them laughing...

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,568
It's nice when you can
laugh together like that.

36
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,989
-It is nice.
-It means you get along.

37
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,200
The comedy trio Robert would say,
"They're so easy to work with!"

38
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,412
She's easy to work with.

39
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,790
The type you'd want to hang out with.

40
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,543
-But the reason she's easy to talk to...
-Stop that.

41
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,797
"She's the least pretty of the three."

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,175
That shocking, shocking assessment.

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,512
She's probably the least pretty
of the three.

44
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,556
But after getting to know her...

45
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,267
she's really pretty to me.

46
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,272
Just as the two of them become closer,
Terrace House does something like this.

47
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,566
A new female member joins.

48
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,485
-Are you from Hawaii?
-No, I'm from Japan.

49
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,904
Japan?

50
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,574
-But you live in Hawaii?
-It's been about three years.

51
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,409
What kind of guy is your type?

52
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,619
Well, I surf.

53
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,080
Do you?

54
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,833
I've only been doing it for two years.

55
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,376
-You must be really good.
-Not at all.

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,503
I'd like someone I can go surfing with.

57
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,590
-Let's go together.
-Yeah, let's go. I'm glad.

58
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:58,261
The way Yuya was looking at Haneishi...

59
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,638
it seemed like he was interested.

60
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:05,685
She's the type guys like,
the type they're attracted to.

61
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,730
-The way she dresses is cute.
-Tomochika would say...

62
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,816
that she's got an erotic mouth.

63
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,611
-Plump.
-Yes, plump.

64
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,155
The two of them have surfing in common.

65
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,578
Saito noticed in that scene
that Avian's eyes went to Yuya for a sec.

66
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,413
-That's right.
-At Yuya.

67
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,333
It's like Cristiano Ronaldo
before a pass.

68
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,544
-Was it really like that?
-Was it?

69
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,337
If so, that's a big deal.

70
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,590
-She's definitely going to pass.
-Definitely.

71
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,051
And there's also a new male member.

72
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,637
-Today!
-We'll get to see him today.

73
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,223
I'll be going to Hawaii to fall in love.

74
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,143
He looks attractive.

75
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,353
What if his eyes are far apart?

76
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,775
You're terrible!

77
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,069
-You're terrible.
-Enough to be a turn off.

78
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,405
Of course they won't be.

79
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,157
What's wrong if they are?

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,659
No, if they're really far apart.

81
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,328
-That's not even human.
-Just barely.

82
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,624
So that point where he's not
human if they're any farther apart?

83
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,544
Do you--

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,090
-I'll go.
-Eric!

85
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,591
Eric?

86
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,135
-What?
-No way!

87
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,262
Seriously?

88
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,933
-A third new member?
-Not three.

89
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,310
-Eric is still here.
-He is.

90
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,148
-Hello.
-Come in.

91
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,568
Excuse me.

92
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,946
-Are you okay?
-Thank you, I'm all right.

93
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,155
Wow.

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,703
-Should I put my bags here?
-Sure, anywhere.

95
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,627
-Hello.
-Hello.

96
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,505
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Taishi Tamaki.

97
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,715
-Taishi Tamaki?
-Yes.

98
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,343
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,971
-I'm Yuya.
-Yuya? Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,849
-I'm Anna.
-Anna? Nice to meet you.

101
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,434
-I'm Lauren.
-Lauren? Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,855
-I'm Avian.
-Avian? It's nice to meet you.

103
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,567
-I brought some gifts.
-Seriously?

104
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,238
-I came from Los Angeles.
-I see.

105
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,198
-You came from Los Angeles?
-Yes.

106
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,410
-You're from Los Angeles?
-I'm not from LA.

107
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:32,457
I work as an actor in Hollywood.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,128
-How long have you lived there?
-A year and a half, almost two.

109
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,383
So I still don't speak English very well.

110
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,636
-There's a lot of stuff.
-Thank you!

111
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,973
-I figured I should have six.
-Thank you.

112
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,975
-Wow!
-And...

113
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,019
Dark almond.

114
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,772
Some were half off.

115
00:05:55,855 --> 00:06:00,277
-See's Candies is so good.
-I love it.

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,737
-How old are you?
-I'm 29.

117
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,532
And you?

118
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,161
-I'm 18.
-You're 18? 18 years old?

119
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,538
I'm 18.

120
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,541
Well, it's nice to meet you.
How about...

121
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,709
-I'm 26.
-26?

122
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,378
-I'm 18.
-18?

123
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,298
-I'm 22.
-Okay, 22.

124
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,134
-Seriously? You don't look it.
-There's one more who's 27.

125
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,678
27? Phew! That's good.

126
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,763
-There's a 27-year-old.
-I'm glad.

127
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,598
What do you plan on doing in Hawaii?

128
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,102
I plan on falling in love in Hawaii.

129
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,398
-You're determined.
-You've got determination.

130
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:43,111
I left all my jobs in Hollywood for this.

131
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,947
What kind of person are you looking for?

132
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,284
Generally, I like really feminine girls.

133
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,371
But I don't know.
I plan to just go for it.

134
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,916
And hopefully not fail... I think.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,461
I'm so nervous, it's bad.

136
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
-I think everyone's nervous.
-Really?

137
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,880
You're right.

138
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,384
-Why are your hands so...
-I was thinking that, too.

139
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,472
-How embarrassing.
-Lauren draws.

140
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,308
I love to draw. I was drawing earlier.

141
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,060
Are you an artist?

142
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,271
-She's really good.
-I see. Wow.

143
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,441
-I'd like to go to LA in the future.
-Seriously?

144
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,569
-So we're in the same boat.
-Yes.

145
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,903
How long did you live in Japan?

146
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:31,659
I was born in LA
and lived there until I was six.

147
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,329
Then I went back to Okinawa.

148
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,665
-Oh, Okinawa.
-Yes, that's why my features are defined.

149
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,251
Yeah, I see it.

150
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,044
TAISHI TAMAKI, 29 YEARS OLD
ACTOR

151
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,295
-Yes, a little.
-I see.

152
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,840
So I grew up in Okinawa,

153
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,261
I went to college in Tokyo,
graduated and became an actor.

154
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,679
Then I moved to Los Angeles.

155
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,556
That's kind of how it went.

156
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,185
-You were born and raised in Japan?
-Yes.

157
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,981
My dad is American and my mom is Japanese.

158
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,025
Do you speak Japanese with your dad?

159
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,944
We spoke English when I was younger.

160
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,947
I heard I spoke it when I was six, too.

161
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,409
-But I've forgotten everything.
-I don't remember it.

162
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,452
-I see.
-We'll teach you.

163
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,413
Please do, teacher.

164
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,167
Teach... Teach me Japanese.
I can't talk right now.

165
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,251
What?

166
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,212
You're so nervous.

167
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,007
-Please teach me Japanese.
-Of course.

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,082
ANNA HANEISHI, 22 YEARS OLD
PART-TIMER

173
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,543
TAISHI TAMAKI, 29 YEARS OLD
ACTOR

174
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,888
Wow, it's so cute.
I'm looking forward to my time here.

175
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,891
-Us, too.
-It's nice having you.

176
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,434
Are you looking for love?

177
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,105
I'd love to find it...

178
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,773
but I haven't found anyone.

179
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,694
You guys haven't been
in relationships in a while?

180
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,529
No.

181
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,906
-What do you think?
-Of the guys.

182
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,117
Of the guys.

183
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,703
-But I haven't met one of them.
-Yes.

184
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,331
Not counting that one.

185
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,459
From the one's in the house at the moment.

186
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,919
What do you think of the other two?

187
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,672
They both made good impressions.

188
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,466
I guess...

189
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,926
-I'll have to see.
-You'll see.

190
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,722
I'm really looking forward
to living in this beautiful house.

191
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:03,103
Hawaii is small, but it's hard
to meet people, don't you think?

192
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,064
-I've never dated anyone in Hawaii before.
-Really?

193
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,442
I've also never had a relationship
in Hawaii.

194
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,862
I haven't dated in Terrace House.

195
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,244
A date...? Yusuke...
It was kind of a date.

196
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,290
Date...

197
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,876
Don't stop there, Lauren.

198
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,170
Wait a second...

199
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,259
It wasn't quite a date?
There's a fine line?

200
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,346
There was
a little miscommunication, I think.

201
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,933
Do you have other plans in Hawaii
other than finding love?

202
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,397
Well, I was thinking of working.

203
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,484
There seems to be
an agency in Hawaii, too,

204
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,529
so I was thinking of joining that.

205
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,614
I need more information.

206
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,783
What do you do normally?

207
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,118
-I go to school.
-School?

208
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,038
-What kind of school?
-A language school.

209
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,415
-Can I go, too?
-Yes.

210
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,624
-Really?
-Yes.

211
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,169
-Maybe I'll go.
-Oh, do you want to?

212
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,878
-Yeah.
-You can come.

213
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,589
What is it like?

214
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,342
It's from the morning until the evening.

215
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,929
-Well, we study English until 3:30.
-Pretty hardcore.

216
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,682
-Vocabulary, grammar, listening...
-I see.

217
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,892
Then I won't have time to work.

218
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,312
-Maybe not.
-I see.

219
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,773
Can I take just a few classes?

220
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,819
You can do just the morning classes
if you want to free up the afternoons.

221
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,903
I see.

222
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,699
Can I ask you a personal question?

223
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,201
What's the relationship situation like?

224
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,661
-In the house?
-Yes.

225
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,624
Well, I have feelings for Avian.

226
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,041
-Seriously?
-Yes.

227
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,752
You're making moves?

228
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,130
-I've asked her out on dates.
-Seriously?

229
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,632
I see.

230
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,260
Anyone you like on first impression?

231
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,303
-First impression?
-Or were you too nervous?

232
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,973
Yeah, I was just trying to keep up.

233
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,559
I was nervous.

234
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,771
I did think everyone was cute.

235
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,736
Do you go to acting school?

236
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,490
I did from time to time.

237
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,034
And I was supposed to start
in January again,

238
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,994
but I had to cancel.

239
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,954
It's interesting though.

240
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,458
In Japan, you just get into it.

241
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,296
You do some theater and learn as you go.

242
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,132
But in America, there's method acting.

243
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:42,387
There are techniques to learn
on how to play a role.

244
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,181
That's what I wanted to learn.

245
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,268
For example, how you use emotions,

246
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:53,189
how to draw those emotions from yourself.

247
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,984
-Wow.
-To become that character you mean?

248
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,069
Yes, it's interesting.

249
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,822
-And auditions?
-Many auditions.

250
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,117
There could be a thousand people
auditioning for a role.

251
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,286
-That many?
-Initially.

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,082
Then you audition once you get chosen.

253
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,667
Do you get nervous?

254
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,462
-Nervous?
-You seem experienced.

255
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,797
No, I'm not at all.

256
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,632
The supermoon is amazing.

257
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,052
-Oh, yeah, today's the last day.
-Let's go see it later.

258
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,680
-The supermoon.
-Here. I'll take that.

259
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,181
Thanks.

260
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,685
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

261
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,188
What's everyone doing tomorrow?

262
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,440
Tomorrow...

263
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,985
-We're boxing together at 5:00.
-That's right.

264
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,362
Boxing?

265
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,574
-It's a complete coincidence.
-We're members of the same gym.

266
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,117
Do you have plans for tomorrow?

267
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,078
I was going to look for work.

268
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,122
What kind of work?

269
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,502
Somewhere where there aren't
too many Japanese people.

270
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,755
I need to expose myself to English,
or else I'll forget.

271
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,008
-How's your English?
-We could...

272
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,635
How's your English?

273
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,722
English test.

274
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,682
Scary!

275
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,323
-You can totally speak English.
-Not at all.

276
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,339
It's so nice!

277
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,133
-Nice.
-Can you see the supermoon?

278
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,261
-It was big yesterday.
-It was biggest when I came home.

279
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,638
It's the last night tonight.

280
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,182
-It's beautiful.
-Nice. I wanna go in the pool!

281
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,561
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

282
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,524
Are you the famous Papa Eric?

283
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,401
Oh, a new member!

284
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,697
-You couldn't see?
-I didn't see at all.

285
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,240
It's nice to meet you.

286
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,202
You both came at the same time?

287
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,163
-I'm Eric. Nice to meet you.
-I'm Anna.

288
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,790
-I'm Taishi.
-I'm Eric.

289
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,166
-What was it again?
-Taishi.

290
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,876
Haichi? Taichi?

291
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,587
-Taishi.
-I'm Anna.

292
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,256
Actually, I'll be leaving soon.

293
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,593
-Really?
-Has that been decided already?

294
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,677
Yes.

295
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,055
-Around the 18th or 19th.
-The 18th or 19th?

296
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,850
-So you won't be here for Christmas.
-No.

297
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,482
-So I'll only be here a little.
-Then we'll have to have some beer.

298
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,066
That makes me happy.

299
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,778
Having someone to drink with.

300
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,073
-Taishi!
-Yes, Taishi.

301
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,408
He's very noble looking.

302
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,911
He has strong eyebrows.

303
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:58,124
-It's nice. He's lively.
-He's looking more and more attractive.

304
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,084
Saito noticed something.

305
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,879
Lauren seems very excited.

306
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,882
-That's true.
-For Lauren, it's a Terrace House first.

307
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,342
Yes, she's never acted like that for me.

308
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,637
-For you?
-It's very frustrating.

309
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,388
Is it because he's older?

310
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,184
He's older and seems like a good guy.

311
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,895
He's well-spoken.

312
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,856
Lauren initiated conversation
during dinner.

313
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,526
Yes, so he can practice speaking English.

314
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,110
I think it's good.

315
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,531
So it's about appearances after all.

316
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,785
But if Saito's head was fluffier,
he'd be like Taishi.

317
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,370
-Is he the same type?
-We are similar.

318
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,166
-You do have a manly face.
-Yes.

319
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,250
But you've got this.

320
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,630
-He's going to get the flu.
-I'll need a week off.

321
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,174
-It's the flu, after all.
-That's tough.

322
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,843
I wanted to be with Lauren.

323
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,970
All you had to do was open the door.

324
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,931
I really wanted to open that door.

325
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,934
If only I could go.
I'm a little busy right now.

326
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,562
That's true.

327
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,031
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

328
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,868
-You're leaving already?
-Yes, I'm going.

329
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,495
-The coffee might be a little weak.
-Thanks.

330
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,748
Is it weak?

331
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,169
-When will you be done? 4:00?
-Yeah.

332
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,338
-Is it strong enough?
-Yeah, it's good.

333
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,968
-Thanks for this. I'll look into it.
-Sure.

334
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,721
I'm sorry I can't show you around.

335
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,306
Don't worry about it.
Whenever you have the time.

336
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,228
-Do you like sweets?
-I love sweets.

337
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,771
-Like pancakes?
-I love pancakes.

338
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,731
-Really?
-Yeah.

339
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,817
-There are so many places in Hawaii.
-That's true.

340
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,652
-See you.
-Bye.

341
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,490
If there's anywhere you want to go to...

342
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,660
So, you're free until 5:00 today?

343
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,246
Yeah, until 5:00.

344
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,623
-You're free?
-Yeah.

345
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,874
I have lots of time.

346
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,711
Do you mind accompanying me?
I'm still new to Hawaii.

347
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,881
Let's go for a drive,
maybe along the beach.

348
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,842
I know it's cliché,
but can we go to Waikiki?

349
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,135
Sure.

350
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,180
-Then let's go to Waikiki and have lunch.
-Sure.

351
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,728
This is perfect! It's insane!

352
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,898
-This feels good.
-Right?

353
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,066
This is insane!

354
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,988
-Let's go.
-Insane!

355
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,618
So you've never had a boyfriend out here?

356
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,912
-No.
-I see.

357
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,955
What's your type?

358
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,332
-I like manly guys.
-I see.

359
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,795
I tend to do everything on my own.

360
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:54,300
-So you want someone who takes the lead.
-Yeah, I think that would be nice.

361
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,303
-That's Diamond Head, by the way.
-Oh, this is it?

362
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,930
I had no idea.

363
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,015
-It's huge.
-Then I'm glad I mentioned it.

364
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,561
-It's so nice. This drive is so fun!
-Yeah, nature is nice.

365
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,986
The sand is white.

366
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,197
It feels nice, doesn't it?

367
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,534
This is nice. It's the ocean!

368
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,286
It's so pretty.

369
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,915
The way the waves sparkle is nice.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,128
-Did it turn out okay?
-It looks good!

371
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,505
It's not backlit. It looks good.

372
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,382
-I'll send it later.
-Yeah, please do.

373
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,891
-This is amazing.
-Looks good.

374
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,810
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

375
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,105
Looks so good!

376
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,107
The long-awaited loco moco.

377
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,072
It's so good.

378
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,200
Have you found a job yet?

379
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,203
I haven't thought about it.
I've been having too much fun.

380
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,456
-You said by the end of this week.
-Yeah.

381
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,626
-It shouldn't be too hard.
-I'm sure.

382
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,587
Did you work for long
at the Japanese restaurant in LA?

383
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,758
About half a year.

384
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,302
I told them I'm going to go fall in love.

385
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,767
That's determination, coming to Hawaii.

386
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,227
Have you experienced a love of a lifetime?

387
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
Never.

388
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,106
What are you like in a relationship?

389
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,028
I don't know,
but I think I get pretty into it.

390
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,655
You focus on it?

391
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,657
Do you usually initiate?

392
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,617
It can go either way,

393
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,579
but it's never gone well
with girls who asked me out.

394
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,416
-So, it's better if you initiate?
-Yeah.

395
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,459
I've never been the one to initiate.

396
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,129
I'd like to be in a relationship
that I initiate.

397
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
Good.

398
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,590
Challenge is good.

399
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,054
We went to eat loco moco.

400
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,973
-Where'd you go?
-You went to eat?

401
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,349
We did.

402
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,727
-Aloha Table, I think.
-Yeah.

403
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,814
-The demi-glace sauce was so good.
-It was, wasn't it?

404
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,525
-Where? In Waikiki?
-Yeah, Aloha Table in Waikiki.

405
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,402
I was enjoying Hawaii.

406
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,822
-Let's play basketball tomorrow.
-Let's surf.

407
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,073
-Basketball.
-Surf.

408
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,908
-Basketball.
-Surf.

409
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,327
-Let's play basketball.
-Let's surf.

410
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
Why?

411
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,916
Basketball. It's decided. After school.

412
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,669
-Taishi, you practice kendo?
-No, not kendo.

413
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,629
What is it?

414
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,799
-Tate-do.
-Tate-do?

415
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,968
-Iaido.
-What's different?

416
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,511
Tate-do uses a wooden sword,

417
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,764
while iaido uses a practice sword.

418
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,851
Oh, I see.

419
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,728
-Can we see it now?
-Now?

420
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,689
You brought it, right?
I want to see!

421
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,650
-I want to see.
-Well, okay.

422
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,241
Oh, wow!

423
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,742
You're a professional.

424
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,495
-No, I'm not a pro.
-Try something.

425
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,288
What you normally do.

426
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,540
Like what you practice all the time.

427
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,960
-Is it for movies?
-Yes, for movies.

428
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,256
There's a style where you swing straight.

429
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,383
But mine, you swing diagonally.

430
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,386
The way he holds it is amazing.

431
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,180
Seems painful if it hits you.

432
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,392
You usually wear armor.

433
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,645
-You wear armor?
-It hits the armor.

434
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,854
So you go diagonally.

435
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,773
-Be careful up top.
-Don't worry.

436
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,069
-Wow.
-Amazing.

437
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,070
Here's my iaido sword.

438
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,698
Oh, so you practice with that first?

439
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,535
-I saw it yesterday.
-Wow!

440
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,788
-That's scary.
-That's amazing!

441
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,999
-I've never seen one!
-Is it real?

442
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,501
No, I wouldn't be able
to bring a real one.

443
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,835
A practice sword.

444
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,588
Amazing.

445
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,676
-You're going to continue in Hawaii?
-Yeah, I brought it to practice.

446
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,471
-Wow.
-Katori Shinto-ryu.

447
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,349
What made you want to do this?

448
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:16,812
If you're Japanese,
those types of roles are common.

449
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,647
So I wanted to be proficient.

450
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,618
Good morning.

451
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,246
My shirt had a hole in it.

452
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,667
-It sucks when you get a hole.
-Yeah.

453
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,587
What are you doing today?

454
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,839
Today? Um...

455
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,052
I'm going with Avian to Costco at 6:30,
if you're free.

456
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,511
-Costco?
-Yeah.

457
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,973
So no plans until then?

458
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,515
No plans.

459
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,643
-Have you thought about lunch?
-I haven't.

460
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,981
-Then let's go somewhere.
-Shall we? Okay.

461
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,523
-I've got a ton of time.
-A ton?

462
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,441
Tons and tons.

463
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,318
Anywhere you want to go?

464
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,903
-You're vegetarian, right?
-Yes.

465
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,199
Let's go somewhere like that.
Are there a lot of places in Hawaii?

466
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,160
-There's a place I like.
-Oh, yeah?

467
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,579
-You want to go?
-Let's go there.

468
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,833
Did you really join Terrace House
to find love?

469
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,502
Yeah.

470
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:27,174
In an acting class,
they tell you to open yourself up more.

471
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,052
So if I fall in love

472
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:34,598
and become deeply connected to someone,

473
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,519
then it might make me more appealing
as an actor as well.

474
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,812
I'm turning 30 next year.

475
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,232
We're 11 years apart!

476
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,026
-Isn't that crazy?
-Eleven?

477
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,194
-Eleven years.
-Well...

478
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,030
Here it is.

479
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,915
-I'm hungry.
-Me, too.

480
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,583
You have two siblings?

481
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,336
Yes, I'm the youngest.

482
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,547
-Do you have siblings?
-I have three.

483
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,798
-Three?
-Yeah.

484
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,885
I have an older brother,
and a younger brother and sister.

485
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,264
You're the youngest,
so you're probably a crybaby.

486
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:20,436
When I'm really stressed, I cry.

487
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,438
Do you cry a lot?

488
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,357
-I cry easily.
-Really?

489
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,570
-I cry watching movies.
-Me, too.

490
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,405
What kind of movies do you like?

491
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,657
I really like sad Japanese movies.

492
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,159
-Really?
-I love them.

493
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,785
I also like Japanese movies.

494
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,246
Nice. Let's watch a movie.

495
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,290
I'll rent one.

496
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,293
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

497
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,630
-Your goal is similar to Yuya's.
-Yeah.

498
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,802
You should help Yuya.
Teach him what you know.

499
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,680
I'll totally help him.

500
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,599
I'm still a newbie, too.

501
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,518
-It's been two and a half months?
-Yeah.

502
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,313
You haven't fallen for anyone?

503
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,443
-No, I haven't.
-You haven't?

504
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,197
Was the timing not right?

505
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,159
It wasn't the timing.

506
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,497
Everyone just became a good friend.

507
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm full. It's surprisingly filling.

508
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,674
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,427
Oh, no, take your time.

510
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,224
You have a beautiful face.

511
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,476
I mean...

512
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,043
That's not fair!

513
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,214
Do you guys talk about relationships?

514
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,635
With other guys? We do.
I used to talk to Eric.

515
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,136
About what?

516
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,305
Like...

517
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,349
if there are places
you wouldn't know about.

518
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,185
Places I don't know?

519
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,977
I do live here.

520
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,991
Wanna stretch?

521
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,579
-I have a leg cramp.
-Are you okay?

522
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,956
I'll help you.

523
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,376
Face up. Face up. Yeah.

524
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,837
Ow!

525
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,089
Just give me one leg then.

526
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,218
-Does this hurt?
-It doesn't hurt.

527
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,970
I feel like Cinderella.

528
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,357
Okay. Does it still hurt?

529
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,441
No.

530
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,863
Do you have plans for Christmas?

531
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,491
No plans yet. Just one party.

532
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,033
Really?

533
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,329
Want to go somewhere?

534
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,957
A Christmas date.

535
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,794
On the 24th or the 25th?

536
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,298
-Do you have school?
-If it isn't a weekend, I'll have school.

537
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,177
But you'll be off for Christmas, right?

538
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,138
Let's go out on a date.

539
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,556
A Christmas date.

540
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,933
Where?

541
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,435
Where do you want to go?

542
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,146
I thought we could decide together.

543
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,774
I don't know. I can't think of anything.

544
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,944
I'll come up with some options.

545
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,696
What would be good?

546
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,952
I want to have Christmas dinner.

547
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,331
What would be good?

548
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,042
You're thinking so hard about it.

549
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,421
But I can't think of a good place.

550
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,257
You're leaving everything to me.

551
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,175
Well...

552
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,470
Let's do some research.

553
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,266
Let's research.

554
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,030
Close.

555
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,458
-This is bad.
-That was rough.

556
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,875
Oh, no!

557
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,586
-This is rough, right?
-Oh, no!

558
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,171
-Attention please.
-Yes, teacher.

559
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,467
While you were all talking...

560
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,636
Avian said something important.

561
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,350
I don't know if she pulled her muscle,
but you all saw the stretching scene.

562
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,978
She said, "I feel like Cinderella."

563
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,732
Then she went with the flow
and said in English,

564
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,900
"I'm your Cinderella."

565
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,447
He made a perplexed face
and then put her foot down.

566
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,367
He obviously looked troubled.

567
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,536
Obviously, Yuya is having
a change of heart.

568
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,123
-Right when we were all fooling around?
-Yes.

569
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,292
She asked him out on a Christmas date.

570
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,920
-But he wasn't into it.
-He wasn't answering.

571
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,716
I'm sure you've all experienced it.
When you're not into it, you don't talk.

572
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,092
It was exactly that.

573
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,928
-I sort of know how Yuya feels.
-What do you mean?

574
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,930
When you like an older woman,

575
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,809
it's good while you're the one chasing.

576
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:58,524
To have her suddenly become that into you
the way Avian is with Yuya,

577
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,651
you would be taken aback a bit.

578
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,446
That's why during dinner,

579
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,740
when she was like,
"Let's play basketball,"

580
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,701
-he seemed like he wasn't into it.
-Yes, that's right.

581
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,077
That's scary!

582
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,873
The chances are low
that Anna has anything to do with it,

583
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,667
but there's a little of that.

584
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,253
Love that began as a chase
needs to continue as a chase.

585
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,923
I see.
So she should act like she isn't into him.

586
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,217
Women always fall into that trap.
I'm telling you, it's stupid.

587
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,596
And you can't sleep with them.

588
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,806
Look who's talking.

589
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,142
-He'll get worse.
-Tuberculin.

590
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,310
Tuberculin?

591
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,188
I haven't heard that in a while.

592
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,649
-An old-school shot.
-Yes.

593
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,901
The one that hurts.

594
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,320
-Well, we still don't know.
-We don't know.

595
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,531
This is all in our imagination.

596
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,115
And during all this...

597
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,118
Tamaki and Lauren are looking good.

598
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,374
He's good. He just throws it in
and tells her she's beautiful.

599
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,419
Yes, he stares at her awhile.

600
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,297
As she's eating, she looks up and is like,
"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be quick."

601
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,466
"Oh, no, it's not that.

602
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,509
I was thinking about
how beautiful you are."

603
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,720
-Like that.
-He's leaving it open.

604
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,056
And the way Lauren is embarrassed...

605
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:17,936
He's very smart, isn't he?

606
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,314
-He is.
-And it's not in a lewd way.

607
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,024
He keeps it light and easy.

608
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,237
His boss from the sushi place
did compliment him before he came.

609
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,782
He said he's seen many people,
but Taishi was serious and good.

610
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:35,537
He's serious and he's got
the likeableness of Okinawans.

611
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,248
-The friendliness.
-Yes, the friendliness.

612
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,415
It's refreshing.

613
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,918
When is the pop-up store opening?

614
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,257
-When will the store be done?
-It's been forever!

615
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,136
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

616
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,517
It's good.

617
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,520
-Did you look for a job today?
-No.

618
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,649
I had lunch with Lauren.

619
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,109
You did? Did you have fun?

620
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,655
I did, but I was tired today.

621
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,198
You were practicing kendo in the morning.

622
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,284
It's not kendo.

623
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,870
-You were practicing?
-No, just part of my daily routine.

624
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,124
-In the morning?
-Yeah, it feels good in the morning.

625
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,418
-I'm so full.
-What about Yuya?

626
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,878
He's sleeping downstairs.

627
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,756
Did he go surfing today?

628
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,759
-I wonder.
-He said he was going.

629
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,304
-Where did Avian go?
-I don't know. Back to her room?

630
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,433
-I'm going to go.
-Okay.

631
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,903
-Yes?
-Can I come in?

632
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,987
Come in.

633
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,037
I was wondering what you're up to.

634
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,665
-I was just checking an email.
-Really?

635
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,501
-It's spacious.
-Isn't it?

636
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,798
This is Anna's.

637
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,175
-I'm here and Lauren's there.
-I see.

638
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,761
So this is the girl's room.

639
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,471
-Yes.
-It's so clean.

640
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,349
-Sit down. Here's a cushion.
-Okay.

641
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,892
Wherever you want.

642
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,563
I was wondering what you're doing.

643
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:29,192
I was just going through my emails.

644
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,822
-Thanks for cooking and the beer.
-Oh, no problem.

645
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,491
I seriously wanted a drink.

646
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,035
I went to Costco with Lauren, so...

647
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,453
I'll pay you later.

648
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,958
-You're working tomorrow, too?
-Yes, tomorrow, too.

649
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,878
Starting at 10:00 in the morning.

650
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,213
-Can I come visit?
-Sure.

651
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,841
-Come.
-Is there a good time?

652
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,844
-Noon.
-Noon?

653
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,638
-Is that okay?
-It's good.

654
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,181
We could get lunch,
and you can show me around Waikiki.

655
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,183
Okay, what do you want to eat?

656
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,978
I had loco moco and vegan food already.

657
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,523
Maybe pancakes?
You probably don't want that for lunch.

658
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,983
-That's okay.
-Are you sure?

659
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,403
Is there a place? I'll look it up.

660
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,572
-Can I leave it to you?
-Sure.

661
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,367
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Sure.

662
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,245
Tomorrow then. Pancakes.

663
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,122
It doesn't have to be pancakes.

664
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,833
-It can even just be tea.
-Okay.

665
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,920
-See you later then.
-Bye.
