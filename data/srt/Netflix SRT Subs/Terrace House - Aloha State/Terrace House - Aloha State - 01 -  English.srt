1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:18,644
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,729
and we observe
how they interact with each other.

4
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,149
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

5
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,652
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,863
Tonight, we start a new season in Hawaii.

7
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,616
Terrace House: Aloha State!

8
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,288
-Hawaii was fun, wasn't it?
-So much fun.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,957
We went, too.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,836
It was the most fun I had on a work trip.

11
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,714
It was really fun.

12
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,966
I can say it with confidence
that I had fun.

13
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,926
-Hawaii.
-Hawaii.

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,428
-It was nice, wasn't it?
-It was.

15
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,223
-But on our last day, Yamachan...
-That's right.

16
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,059
He got lost at Ala Moana Center.

17
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,936
-It was, like, give us a break.
-Seriously.

18
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,605
That was the only hiccup.

19
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,816
Yu told me that I was definitely
the least eligible bachelor.

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,068
You're the number one bachelor right now.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,446
-Yes, he's number one right now.
-Tokui is so sweet.

22
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,615
Every day...

23
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:18,829
he'd find out what's the best burger place
for us to go to.

24
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,957
-Yes, thank you.
-It's easy with the Internet.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,627
-Yes, the difference was astounding.
-Torichan!

26
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,882
In Hawaii, I realized
how different men can be from one another.

27
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:34,177
-I got in trouble at customs.
-That's right.

28
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,222
And one time, I got lost...

29
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,974
-You got plastered.
-Yes, very.

30
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,309
You couldn't check in.

31
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,687
You opened your luggage in the lobby.

32
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,440
You opened all your luggage in the lobby
thinking it was your room.

33
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,027
-Did you check in?
-I did.

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,154
-What are you talking about?
-What?

35
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,031
-I did it for you.
-I'm sorry.

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,701
Yu and I went to the front desk together.

37
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,120
We said,
"That guy hasn't checked in yet."

38
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,372
-It was so late.
-They said,

39
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,126
"You're checking in at 3:00 a.m.?
Are you serious?"

40
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,462
It was so fun.
I was happy to be with everyone.

41
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,672
It really was fun.

42
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:14,885
Terrace House is currently available
in 190 countries, by the way.

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,347
Since it's been gaining popularity,
we have our first season abroad.

44
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,767
Twenty-four episodes have been ordered.

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,102
-I hope it continues further.
-Yes.

46
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,314
But how could Hawaii's clear sky
provoke any drama?

47
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,984
-It seems unlikely.
-Yeah, very unlikely.

48
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,653
It'll let them be more candid.

49
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,030
And resolve their issues rationally.

50
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,324
It might go quickly.

51
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,161
-Hawaii! I'm looking forward to it.
-Let's watch.

52
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,648
Am I the first one here?

53
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,593
Hello.

54
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,220
Hello.

55
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,141
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

56
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm Yuya Shibusawa.
I'm 18 years old.

57
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,396
-I'm Lauren Tsai.
-Nice to meet you.

58
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,815
-I'm 18.
-You're 18?

59
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,274
-Yes, the same.
-The same?

60
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,609
-Yes.
-Nice.

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,862
The same, huh?

62
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,952
-Lauren?
-Yes, Lauren.

63
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,578
-Lauren?
-Tsai.

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,704
-Tsai?
-Yes.

65
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:34,376
-Are you from here?
-I was born in Massachusetts.

66
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:40,257
I moved to Hawaii when I was seven
and I've been here for about 11 years.

67
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,550
You're pretty pale though.

68
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,052
-Everyone...
-You don't tan?

69
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,388
Everyone always tells me that.

70
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,432
-That you're pale?
-Yeah, I am. I stay in a lot.

71
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,478
-You don't go outside much?
-I don't really like the sun.

72
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,275
-Were you born here?
-I was born and raised in Japan.

73
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,736
-Where in Japan?
-In the Yokosuka area. Do you know it?

74
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,281
-I don't, sorry.
-You don't?

75
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,074
My dad is American.

76
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,118
-Oh, okay. So you're a half?
-Yes, a half.

77
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,369
Yeah.

78
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,664
I just graduated from high school.
I want to go to acting school.

79
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,375
-Ah, to be an actor.
-Yes.

80
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,421
So I'm trying to learn English,
but I know it'll take time.

81
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,256
-I see.
-Yeah.

82
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,258
I can learn here.

83
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,093
You teach me English,
I teach you Japanese.

84
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,804
-Oh, okay, please do.
-Please teach me, too.

85
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,600
Wow, there's a pool.

86
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,646
-It even says "Terrace House" on it.
-There's a pool?

87
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,565
Oh, wow!

88
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,486
I want to go in the pool.

89
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,988
-It's amazing.
-It is.

90
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,990
It's like a hotel.

91
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,241
Definitely.

92
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,411
Even for a hotel, it's pretty luxurious.

93
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,588
-Hi.
-Hi.

94
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,388
-Hi, it's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

95
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,766
-I'm Avian.
-Nice to meet you.

96
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,186
-It's nice to meet you.
-I'm Lauren Tsai.

97
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,021
-Lauren?
-Yes, Lauren.

98
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,608
-I'm Shibusawa.
-Shibusawa? I'm Avian.

99
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,986
-Are you half Japanese?
-No, I was born here.

100
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,489
-Oh, you were born here.
-Yes, born and raised here.

101
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,284
I've been here for both
middle school and high school.

102
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,579
I was on the Big Island before.

103
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,584
I lived in Japan for about six years
while I was in elementary school.

104
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,086
What do you do?

105
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:46,675
Right now, I work at 88 Tees,
a T-shirt company in Waikiki.

106
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:51,263
-I know it!
-It's my mom's shop, but I help out.

107
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,976
I work as a shop employee...

108
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,188
Well, I do other things there, too.
Like things on the web and stuff.

109
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,774
-How old are you?
-I'm 25--I mean, 26.

110
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,110
I just had my birthday.

111
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,195
Have you seen everything already?

112
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,696
-No, not yet.
-You haven't yet?

113
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,783
-Just the pool.
-Oh, you saw the pool?

114
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,702
-Want to go see it?
-Yeah, let's go.

115
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,706
Oh, this is the kitchen.

116
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,835
-Wow.
-Beautiful. I love white.

117
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,837
-It's all white.
-It's fully equipped.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
Feels comfortable to live in.

119
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,219
This is nice. Looks relaxing.

120
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,182
You're right, the pool...

121
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,226
It's beautiful.

122
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,068
Hi.

123
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,112
-Hello.
-Hello.

124
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,531
Hi, I'm Eric.

125
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,491
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

126
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,910
I'll sit here.

127
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,745
Is that all right?

128
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,208
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

129
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,126
Where are you from? Hawaii?

130
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm from Nishinomiya
in the Hyogo prefecture in Kansai.

131
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,800
Can you speak English as well?

132
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,970
-I can, but my Japanese is better.
-Oh, nice.

133
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,931
What do you do?

134
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,266
-For work?
-Yes.

135
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,144
I build furniture...

136
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,273
A craftsman, I guess.
That kind of work.

137
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:32,197
I'm also starting a café with a friend.

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,823
-Out here?
-Yes, out here.

139
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,784
Which café is it?

140
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,037
We've decided on a location,

141
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,374
-but we've only just started.
-You've just started?

142
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,709
Yes, on the interior and everything.

143
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm a model and illustrator.

144
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm not a professional yet,
but it's my dream.

145
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:57,054
One day I'd like to work with a company

146
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:02,018
that makes animated films or video games.

147
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,437
-When I'm done with modeling.
-Nice.

148
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,939
-I enjoy modeling, too.
-I see.

149
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,365
-Hello.
-Hello.

150
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,742
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

151
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,703
We're expanding.

152
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,372
Slowly.

153
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,085
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

154
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,381
I'm Naomi Lorraine Frank.
It's nice to meet you.

155
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,341
Nice to meet you.

156
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,803
-What's your background, by the way?
-I'm half American and half Japanese.

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,222
Are you from Japan?

158
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:44,186
No, I was born in America,
but I've lived in Japan since I was seven.

159
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,231
So I'm totally Japanese.

160
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,317
-So you came from Japan?
-Yes, I came from Japan.

161
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,861
-I landed today and immediately came here.
-Today?

162
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,822
Yes, I was just at the airport.

163
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,949
-Wow.
-And pretty much came right here.

164
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:03,913
Are you entirely Japanese
or half Japanese?

165
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,626
I'm half Chinese and half European.

166
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,589
I'm not Japanese, but part Asian.

167
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,841
You speak Japanese really well.

168
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:19,053
When I was 15, I studied abroad in Japan,
in Hiroshima.

169
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,098
I was in Hiroshima for six weeks.

170
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:26,060
It made me want to move to Japan,
so I studied Japanese.

171
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,981
So you pretty much learned on your own.

172
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,526
I'd watch shows like Terrace House
and read the subtitles.

173
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,027
It helps a lot.

174
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,197
It really helps.

175
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,783
-That's the best way to learn languages.
-Yes.

176
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:56,674
I lived with my Japanese mom,
so I only spoke Japanese.

177
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:02,805
So I stopped using English,
and now it's a little...

178
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,474
Someone's here.

179
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,643
-Oh, wow.
-A musician?

180
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,977
It's heavy.

181
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,607
-Hello.
-Hello.

182
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,067
I'm Yusuke Aizawa.

183
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,945
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

184
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,200
-I'm Eric.
-Excuse me.

185
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,248
-Are you a musician?
-Yes, I'm into music.

186
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,252
You've got a ukulele.
That's a ukulele, right?

187
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,962
Yes, a ukulele and a guitar.

188
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,672
Are you from Hawaii?

189
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:42,011
I currently live in Hawaii,
but I'm originally from Tokyo.

190
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,932
-When did you relocate to Hawaii?
-About three years ago.

191
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,352
-That's long.
-What did you do in Japan?

192
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,771
I was playing music in Japan as well.

193
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,107
Apart from that, I was just a student.
I'm currently still a student.

194
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,568
-Over here?
-Yes.

195
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,862
-I turned 18 the day before yesterday.
-What?

196
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,366
-Oh, we're the same. We're 18.
-I'm 18.

197
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,868
-Oh, really?
-You're so young!

198
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,994
I apologize.

199
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,538
I'm 27.

200
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,042
-You're 27 and she's 26.
-I'm 26.

201
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,877
I'm 23.

202
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,172
So that means you're graduating
in September?

203
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,800
-Next May.
-Oh, May, that's right.

204
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:25,555
And after you graduate,
you're going to pursue a music career?

205
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,515
I'd like to continue with music.

206
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,602
I'd like to become a top-level artist.

207
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,024
So do you perform in Hawaii?

208
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,318
I'll go wherever I'm asked to.

209
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,823
Any plans right now?

210
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:48,661
Right now, I'll be going
to an award ceremony

211
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,330
for Hawaiian Music Awards Japan.

212
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:57,920
It's sudden, but I'll be gone
for a few days starting on the 29th.

213
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,507
How sad, so soon?

214
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,801
I released an album last year.

215
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,971
That album made it to the finals.

216
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,933
There was an online vote
that only recently closed.

217
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,478
I was waiting for the results.

218
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,564
The ceremony's actually in Ginza.

219
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,651
Wow, that sounds serious.

220
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,570
-Wow, that's amazing.
-It's amazing.

221
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,032
This group seems like fun.

222
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,618
Everybody does something different.

223
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,286
This is definitely gonna be fun.

224
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,872
-Shall we?
-Let's go see.

225
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,502
This is really amazing.

226
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,879
-You could jump in from here.
-It's beautiful.

227
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,090
-See, you could jump from here.
-That's crazy.

228
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,677
There are places to sit, too.

229
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,680
-I always surf around there.
-Behind that area?

230
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,391
Yeah. You can surf over there, too.

231
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,728
If you sat there and played your ukulele,
it'd be perfect.

232
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,191
-We can light candles...
-You could play here, too.

233
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,694
-It's so cool.
-Wow.

234
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,408
We're so lucky
that we can see this view every day.

-Insane!
-Oh, my God!

244
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,416
What's this? This is insane!

245
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,211
Wow, so stylish.

246
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,506
-Isn't it?
-It's insane.

247
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,882
Wow, the pool!

248
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,763
There's a hammock!
I totally want to nap here.

249
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,599
-There?
-Yeah, here!

250
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,101
-It's cushioned and everything.
-Wow!

251
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,729
-Amazing.
-This is perfect!

252
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,274
Insane!

253
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,192
Wow.

254
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,154
-Is it cold?
-It's warm.

255
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,409
This is really amazing.

256
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,497
I've never lived in a house with a pool.

257
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,290
Super fancy.

258
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,836
-Our room.
-Crazy!

259
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,714
-It's so cute!
-Wow!

260
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,467
-It's so cute!
-What's this?

261
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,473
This is like a dream, like a kid's dream.

262
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,269
Wait, which bed does everyone want?

263
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,022
-Wow, it feels so nice.
-It does!

264
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,149
The view is super nice!

265
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,026
Which bed do we each want?

266
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,612
Rock, paper, scissors!

267
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,407
Rock, paper, scissors!

268
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,244
Oh, no, you're first.

269
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,330
What should I do?
I'll take the top then!

270
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,791
-You're okay with the top?
-Yeah, this one.

271
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,838
-I want the bottom.
-Okay, I'm the opposite. Okay!

272
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,174
-Wow, the bathroom's crazy, too!
-A walk-in closet!

273
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,596
Wow!

274
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,642
-You can see the ocean!
-Oh, yeah!

275
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,311
-It's really like a hotel.
-Amazing!

276
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,106
And there's even a spa bath!

277
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,192
-It could fit the three of us.
-Could it?

278
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,403
-Let's try.
-We can totally fit!

279
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:56,033
-It's a little tight.
-It's okay, I'm small.

280
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,957
Insane!

281
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,628
-Amazing.
-It's amazing.

282
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,590
-It's connected to the pool.
-Wow.

283
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,886
I'm good sleeping anywhere,
so you guys decide.

284
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,722
I don't mind any of them.

285
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,683
-Really? Then I'll take this one.
-I'll take this.

286
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,187
You guys both immediately chose.

287
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,563
I'll take this one.

288
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,274
-You okay with it?
-I'm good.

289
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,361
You could practice guitar here.

290
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,740
-If it doesn't bother you guys.
-Not at all.

291
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,952
Sometimes I play
until the noise bothers people.

292
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,371
I'll think of it as a lullaby and sleep.

293
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,708
If you're able to sleep to it,
I'll be happy.

294
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:50,087
The girls out here...

295
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:54,341
how are they compared to girls in Japan?

296
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,094
They're more assertive. It's nice.

297
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,723
-Is it?
-That's true.

298
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,725
Better than me being pushy
and getting turned down.

299
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,062
I want them to come strongly
so I can respond strongly.

300
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,816
-I get it.
-I feel like that works better.

301
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,820
But I've been single for a while.

302
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,238
Me too, for about three years.

303
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,032
-Three years?
-Yeah.

304
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,661
-Are you with anyone?
-Not for 18 years.

305
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,455
For 18 years, I've never been with anyone.

306
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,665
-That's critical.
-Yeah.

307
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:30,586
-It's your chance for first love here.
-It's bad. I really need...

308
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,215
to start being proactive.

309
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,302
-The playroom.
-The playroom, wow.

310
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,805
-A place to hangout...
-Wow!

311
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,099
-Looks comfortable.
-This is seriously amazing.

312
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,601
It's so stylish.

313
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,772
This is great.

314
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,483
-Knock, knock.
-Yes?

315
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,486
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

316
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,822
We were wondering
what the guys' room was like.

317
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,157
-The guys...
-Wait? Is this it?

318
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,201
-This is it?
-This is the playroom.

319
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,747
Oh, okay.
I thought this was the guys' room.

320
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,956
I see.

321
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,666
It'll be a little tight
if this was our room.

322
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,711
It's so different then.

323
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,922
-How's the room?
-It's pretty amazing.

324
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,132
-Seriously?
-It's perfect.

325
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,384
It's insane. We chose our beds.

326
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,137
The guys' room is pretty nice, too.

327
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,640
-I want to see it.
-Let's go see it later.

328
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,895
What does everyone want to do after?

329
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,356
-I want to go the supermarket.
-Me, too.

330
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,859
-I want to make food.
-Should we go to the market then?

331
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,652
-Let's go.
-Okay.

332
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,446
I need to buy shampoo and food...

333
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,157
Maybe some beer?

334
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,700
We're 18 over here.

335
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,953
-I'll participate!
-I'll drink juice.

336
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,914
I'll be watching you.

337
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,582
Please do.

338
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,461
They're all there.

339
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,799
It's a nice house
and everybody's been revealed.

340
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,259
The spaciousness of that hammock...

341
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,636
I feel like things might happen there.

342
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,889
Maybe they'll want to see the stars
together there.

343
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,934
I want to see two of them on the hammock.

344
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,645
The place has five bedrooms
and is 4,000 square feet.

345
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,773
-That's huge!
-It's so huge!

346
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:18,110
And there are three and a half baths.

347
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,489
If Aizawa got on the hammock
with someone, it might cause a problem.

348
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,615
Eighteen years old
and never had a girlfriend.

349
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,743
He seems very mature.

350
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,411
He's very classy.

351
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,705
-Yes, he is.
-He's very classy.

352
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,791
He's like an apprentice
at the fancy restaurant Kyubey.

353
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,712
-That's true.
-An apprentice saying, "Yes, sir."

354
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,718
When the tune of his ukulele changes,
we'll know something happened.

355
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,222
When you say his ukulele,
you really mean his ukulele, right?

356
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes.

357
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,267
Yes, I mean his ukulele.

358
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,895
I didn't mean it
like "my 'baseball bat'."

359
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,106
-No, I didn't mean it like that.
-The worst euphemism.

360
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,360
I just meant if the sound quality changes
when he plays.

361
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,904
-I see.
-Then something may have changed him.

362
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,949
If Aizawa can get Lauren,
that'll be a dream.

363
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,868
That's true.

364
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,537
-I think that's possible.
-No way!

365
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,832
-It does seem to be possible...
-Right?

366
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,799
-The car keys...
-We each have our own.

367
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,759
Do they have our names?

368
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,345
Oh, I got mine on the first try.

369
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,597
-Avian.
-Thank you.

370
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,684
-Where does it say?
-Wow, we each get our own.

371
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,311
-This one's mine.
-It's so cute!

372
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,923
-Shopping time!
-I'm so hungry!

373
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,342
I'm hungry.

374
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,345
We can all pick stuff out
and eat it together.

375
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,851
Are we cooking today or not?

376
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,563
-If we cook, it'll take time.
-Yeah.

377
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:23,360
They have ready-made food here,
so we can just pick up stuff today.

378
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,239
-It feels so American.
-Let's go with that.

379
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,784
That's good.

380
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,455
-Is that enough?
-Let me know if you get tired.

381
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,707
Good work.

382
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,085
-Anything else?
-Well...

383
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,295
-Let's go.
-Is that too much?

384
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,047
Let's go, let's go.

385
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,757
-Let's go, let's go.
-The steaks are so big.

386
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,058
-Let's eat.
-Shall we eat?

387
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,143
-Time to eat!
-Time to eat!

388
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,023
-Let's toast.
-Cheers.

389
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,441
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

390
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,569
-Thanks for the great day.
-Thank you.

391
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,657
What's everyone doing tomorrow?

392
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,826
-I have work.
-I have work, too.

393
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,245
-From seven to five.
-I've got school.

394
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,041
-Everyone's surprisingly busy.
-Yeah, I'm a student.

395
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,167
Am I the only one who's free?

396
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,588
-You're free, too?
-I'm free.

397
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,384
Should the three of us do something then?

398
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,261
-Yeah, let's do something.
-Yeah.

399
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,596
What do you guys do on your day off?

400
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,183
I usually go to Ala Moana or Waikiki.

401
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,434
Shopping?

402
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,605
But my favorite thing to do
is lounge at home.

403
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,690
I understand.

404
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,734
I totally understand.

405
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:51,615
Between Japanese and American men,
which is easier to get along with?

406
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,619
Which do you like better?

407
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,415
It really depends on the person.

408
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,044
I don't think nationality matters.

409
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:08,757
Do you prefer someone
who grew up in Japan or in America?

410
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,592
It depends on the person.

411
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,928
-Everyone's different.
-That's true.

412
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,056
I don't think it matters.

413
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:20,102
Have you gone out
with an American before? No?

414
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,065
I lived in Japan,
so I've only dated Japanese men.

415
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,858
You must have been popular in Japan.

416
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,528
Well...

417
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,239
there was a time like that.

418
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,533
I see.

419
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,037
Everyone is experienced.

420
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,122
What?

421
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,125
-It's amazing.
-Yes, you mentioned that.

422
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,670
I've never been with anyone before.

423
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:51,049
-You've never had a girlfriend?
-No.

424
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,052
But you've liked a girl before?

425
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,013
I have,
but it didn't work out the way I wanted.

426
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,308
Do you want a girlfriend?

427
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,602
-Yes, if it's possible
-If it's possible?

428
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,145
-Yes.
-Someone nice?

429
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,397
Be more confident, man.

430
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,026
-Do you have a type?
-My type?

431
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,070
Someone cheerful.

432
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,947
I used to be really shy.

433
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,827
I was uncomfortable
talking to people I didn't know.

434
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:25,501
So I'm more attracted to women
who can take the lead a little.

435
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,380
How about everyone else?

436
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,259
Someone who works out, has a nice body...

437
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,593
is manly...

438
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,138
-and sweet...
-That's a lot.

439
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,723
The list keeps getting longer.

440
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,434
And someone clean.

441
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:47,189
I like people who are creative.

442
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:54,112
And I prefer someone calm and more mature.

443
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,866
Someone I can respect.

444
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,411
That's it.

445
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:06,542
I like someone who has goals
and can take the lead.

446
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,293
I see.

447
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,715
-I have a grasp on everyone now.
-You do?

448
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,191
This is a little dangerous.

449
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,862
What time does school start tomorrow?

450
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,656
-8:00 a.m.
-8:00 a.m.?

451
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,534
What time do you usually leave the house?

452
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,369
Usually before seven.

453
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,871
You leave before seven?

454
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,331
-Hey!
-She brought something.

455
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,208
-Dessert?
-Dessert.

456
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,625
There are apples, too.

457
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,002
Thank you.

458
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,215
There's more coming.

459
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,469
Here it comes, late night dessert.

460
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,804
Let's eat.

461
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,974
You want to sit here?
You can't reach, right?

462
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,226
Let's eat.

463
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,770
-Your pajamas are so cute.
-Thank you.

464
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,231
Can you play something for us?

465
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,816
-Right now?
-Will you play something?

466
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:13,942
Play something.

467
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,737
-Something relaxing.
-Yeah.

468
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,031
-Right now? If it's okay...
-Please.

469
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,577
-...give me a few moments please.
-Sure.

470
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,539
-We'll be waiting.
-He's getting into it.

471
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,959
He's getting into his zone.

472
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,836
Here he comes.

473
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,760
-This song is called Dearly.
-Dearly?

474
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,094
It's an original.

475
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,264
-Nice!
-Amazing!

476
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,350
-Wow!
-Amazing.

477
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,019
-That was really cool.
-Wow.

478
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,188
-Really amazing.
-Really cool.

479
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,693
I got goose bumps!

480
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,737
He was way better than I expected.

481
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,281
-It was amazing!
-Wasn't it?

482
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,658
Yusuke, will you play the ukulele, too?

483
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,288
Seriously? Suddenly?

484
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,583
-But he'll do it for us.
-We're getting a show tonight.

485
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,043
-He'll be popular with the ladies.
-Right?

486
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,004
-Definitely.
-In one shot.

487
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,965
-He doesn't show off.
-Yeah.

488
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,384
He doesn't say how good he is.

489
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,596
-But that's what's nice.
-He doesn't say unless we ask.

490
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,475
-Like he doesn't need to say he's good.
-Yeah, totally.

491
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,685
-That's what's so cool.
-It is cool.

492
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,312
That he can play at that level when asked.

493
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,398
Excuse me.

494
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,193
My instrument has shrunk.

495
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,441
Amazing!

496
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,904
-Excuse me.
-Wow, amazing.

497
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,282
I can listen forever.
It was super amazing.

498
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,242
He glides in and glides out.

499
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,913
-He's quick.
-That's what's good about him.

500
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,333
I wish Yusuke would then
go sneak into the girls' room.

501
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,878
On the first night?

502
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,673
I don't want Yusuke to be like that!

503
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,551
-"You heard my ukulele, right?"
-No!

504
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,636
"You heard my ukulele, right?"

505
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,722
"Do you prefer that ukulele or this one?"

506
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,642
-"Hold the neck."
-You're so stupid.

507
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,395
-Look at him.
-I can't believe it.

508
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,397
It's unbelievable.

509
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,232
-I'm sorry Torichan.
-I can't believe it.

510
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,360
The trust you've built in Hawaii...

511
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,362
-it just crumbled.
-I can't believe it.

512
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,407
All the points I earned in Hawaii...

513
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,661
The girls keep saying,
"He has to be popular with the ladies."

514
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,330
Is that the same as saying he's hot?

515
00:31:55,414 --> 00:32:01,795
It is. It's attractive
if you can play an instrument.

516
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,839
Is that how it is?

517
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:09,553
If you're a flirt who plays an instrument,
you might be harder to trust.

518
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,514
But if you're pure like Yusuke...

519
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,392
To say, "No, I've never had a girlfriend,"

520
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,770
and then to suddenly
play the guitar like that...

521
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,483
As Avian and Naomi were listening,

522
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,736
they were saying
he's definitely popular with the ladies,

523
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,071
but Lauren was quiet
and enjoying the music.

524
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,823
-Definitely.
-You think so?

525
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:34,202
Yeah, in the beginning when everyone
was having fun asking him to play,

526
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,874
only Lauren had a different air about her.

527
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,166
No way!

528
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,043
While she was listening, she was like...

529
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,213
She did do that.

530
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,340
She's already taken him in.

531
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,135
-She was like that.
-She was.

532
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,845
She was speaking through expressions.

533
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,640
So will a miracle happen?

534
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,017
-It's possible.
-It's possible.

535
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,434
Even that's...

536
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,436
His pajamas were cute.

537
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,482
-I wonder why he has those.
-Right? They were so cute.

538
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,776
-I wanted to see more of it.
-The glasses were cute, too.

539
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,069
Maybe his master gave it to him.

540
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,113
His master at Kyubey?

541
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,533
"It's what I used to wear
when I was young."

542
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,617
Pajamas?

543
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,201
That's why he wore them?

544
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,078
That's so cute!

545
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,789
But you guys just made all that up!

546
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,000
First of all, he's not from Kyubey.

547
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,547
Are you going in the pool tomorrow?

548
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,674
I want to.

549
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,511
What do you think of the girls?

550
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,430
My type?

551
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,933
Which one seems interesting?

552
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,726
Which is interesting? Well...

553
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,981
I'm not sure.
I don't have an answer.

554
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,318
Then which girl's personality
fits best with yours right now?

555
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:53,824
Avian. I feel like I'd get along with her.
She was smiling the whole time.

556
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,908
You're right.

557
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,996
But definitely... she seems likeable.

558
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,040
Nice.

559
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,543
What about you?

560
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:09,840
Well, Lauren...
I've never met someone like...

561
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,551
like her before.

562
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,347
So I'd like to get to know her.

563
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,474
What about you, Yusuke?

564
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,561
-It's only the beginning.
-Only the beginning.

565
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,688
You should use your guitar.

566
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,233
-Use my guitar?
-Your sidekick.

567
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:33,363
-Super Yusuke.
-Not at all.

568
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,951
-His guitar skills were amazing.
-It was amazing. He's a genius.

569
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
-It was really amazing.
-Seriously.

570
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,999
-I could listen forever.
-He made my eyes sparkle.

571
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,292
He was amazing.

572
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,169
He really feels the music.

573
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:52,883
-But he... How should I put it?
-Humble?

574
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,301
He puts himself down. He doesn't...

575
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,388
He doesn't act like he knows he's good.

576
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,475
I really like that personality.

577
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,436
And he disappears quickly
after he's done.

578
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,731
Yeah, like, "Okay, I'm done."

579
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,941
He's committed to it.

580
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,360
Very serious.

581
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,738
What are your first impressions?

582
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,867
-They're good. Everyone's good.
-Everyone's nice.

583
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,370
Shall we go to sleep?

584
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,957
-Good night, everyone.
-Good night.

585
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,127
-I'm going to sleep.
-Okay.

586
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,053
