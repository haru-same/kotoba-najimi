1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,806
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,185
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,020
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,566
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,859
There is no script at all.

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:30,239
-Terrace House: Aloha State has begun.
-Yes!

7
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,866
-The house is amazing, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,701
It has a pool and everything.

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:38,163
-It's very large.
-A very large house.

10
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,957
And the six new members...

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,917
Things are happening slowly.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,211
We're finding out
what kind of people they are.

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,421
First, we have Lauren Tsai.

14
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,381
-She's 18.
-She's beautiful.

15
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,635
She wants to be an illustrator
and currently models.

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,178
Am I the first one here?

17
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,139
She likes talented men.

18
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,476
She's an aspiring artist,
so maybe we'll get to see her art work.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,978
I want to see them.

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,646
We'd love to see her work.

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,316
Second, we have Yuya Shibusawa,
age 18.

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,985
I wanted to go to acting school.

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,613
-Ah, to be an actor.
-Yes.

24
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,198
I'm trying to learn English.

25
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,075
You teach me English,
I teach you Japanese.

26
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,953
-Oh, okay, please do.
-Please teach me, too.

27
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,371
He's attractive.

28
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,291
He's from Yokosuka.
He may make naval curry someday.

29
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,961
"Here's Yokosuka's special naval curry."

30
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,921
He'll make it for everyone.

31
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,215
I'm sure he'll add some seafood to it.

32
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,051
I don't think naval curry
has seafood in it.

33
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,762
It doesn't?

34
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,682
The American troops served curry
on Fridays so they knew it was Friday.

35
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,600
-Oh, is that it?
-Yes, it was a system.

36
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,354
-You know everything.
-Yes, I do know a bit about some things.

37
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,860
And third, Avian Ku, age 26.

38
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,236
I was born here.

39
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,697
-Oh, you were born here.
-Yes, born and raised here.

40
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,952
Right now, I work with 88 Tees,
a T-shirt company in Waikiki.

41
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:03,498
-I know it!
-It's my mom's shop, but I help out.

42
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,084
I feel like I have a friend
who looks like her.

43
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,920
One of my high school classmates
looks like her.

44
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,007
Yes! She looks like an old classmate
you'd meet again at a wedding.

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,718
-Right?
-What are you talking about?

46
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,639
The daughter of the owner
of a famous T-shirt shop in Hawaii.

47
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,308
And there's Eric, age 27.

48
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,269
I build furniture...

49
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,271
A craftsman, I guess.

50
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,274
I'm also starting a café with a friend.

51
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,985
He's taken on the role of the leader.

52
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,987
Yes, like a big brother.

53
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,324
And Naomi... Naomi Lorraine Frank.

54
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,704
I was born in America,
but I've lived in Japan since I was seven.

55
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,456
So I'm totally Japanese.

56
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,960
She's pretty assertive,
Naomi Lorraine Frank.

57
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,420
She's the modern Tokyo girl.

58
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,840
Finally, there's Yusuke Aizawa, age 18.

59
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,843
-Last week's star.
-A musician who plays ukulele.

60
00:02:55,926 --> 00:03:00,222
For 18 years, I've never dated anyone.

61
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,226
-It's your chance for first love here.
-It's bad. I really need...

62
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,729
to start being proactive.

63
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,377
It was amazing.
He stole their hearts in one performance.

64
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,339
He's actually a pretty impressive guy.

65
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,884
He released an album
while he was in high school.

66
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,013
He's a promising new musician,
and he's also never had a girlfriend.

67
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,807
He has no experience with girls
and is shy.

68
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,143
How will that play out?

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,187
Will we get another performance this week?

70
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,314
-I want one every week.
-Like "This Week's Yusuke"?

71
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,524
Yeah, "This Week's Yusuke."

72
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,151
"This Week's Yusuke"?

73
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,903
"This Week's Yusuke."

74
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,571
-In his pajamas?
-That'd be so cute!

75
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,491
-In a different colored one.
-So cute!

76
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,412
-So he likes that style.
-Yes, that style is comforting to him.

77
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,518
Is this...

78
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,813
Is this it?

79
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,739
Okay.

80
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,911
Off to school! -Yusuke

81
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,070
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

82
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,906
-What are you drinking?
-Right now?

83
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,620
I'll have some milk.

84
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,751
When should we leave today?

85
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,336
When should we leave?

86
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,258
-We're going out for lunch, right?
-Yeah.

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,928
Should we leave around eleven?
But maybe Yu's not up yet.

88
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,848
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

89
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,185
-I have to leave in a bit.
-Oh, okay.

90
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,439
-What's everyone doing today?
-Today? Um...

91
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,860
-The free people...
-The free people.

92
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,156
We're going out for lunch
and then to Costco.

93
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,325
-Okay, have fun then.
-Yes.

94
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,160
-Good luck at work.
-Yeah.

95
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,622
-I'll head out then.
-Bye.

96
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,667
-Be careful! See you later.
-Thanks.

97
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,421
I'll go put on makeup.

98
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,299
I'll do stuff here then.

99
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,977
LAUREN TSAI, 18 YEARS OLD
BORN IN MASSACHUSETTS

100
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,189
ASPIRING ILLUSTRATOR, MODEL
HAS BEEN DRAWING SINCE CHILDHOOD

101
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,733
MOVED TO HAWAII AT THE AGE OF SEVEN
LAST RELATIONSHIP: SIX MONTHS AGO

102
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,202
-Good morning.
-Oh, good morning.

103
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,997
Is that your drawing?

104
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,748
-Yeah.
-You're so good.

105
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,667
I was drawing
while Naomi's putting on makeup.

106
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,464
Were you able to sleep?

107
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,300
-Yeah, you?
-Yeah, I was.

108
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,593
That's good.

109
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,930
How long did it take you to do that?

110
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,598
-This one?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,601
This was my morning sketch.

112
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,186
-Morning sketch?
-And it took...

113
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,815
-It took between 30 minutes to an hour.
-Seriously?

114
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,318
-Wow!
-Not at all.

115
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,320
-It's amazing.
-Not at all.

116
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,905
But thank you.

117
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,493
-You finished your makeup?
-I did.

118
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,245
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

119
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,123
Should we get going soon?

120
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,126
We'll be making pasta! -Naomi
We'll be at Costco. -Lauren

121
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,460
I'll go change.

122
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,215
What?

123
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,633
The blinker...

124
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,679
-I want to go shopping.
-Yeah, me too.

125
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,099
-I want to shop, too.
-We can go to Waikiki in the evening.

126
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,518
-Yeah, I'd love to go there at night.
-It'll be great.

127
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,563
The three of us will likely be free often,
so let's go places.

128
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,191
I'll be free every day until October 10th.

129
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,027
-The 10th?
-That's when I start school.

130
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,694
Oh, you start school. I see.

131
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,408
-Such a pretty view. I'm so happy.
-It's beautiful.

132
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,701
It's very Hawaii.

133
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,872
It feels so good,
but I can't hear you two at all!

134
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,624
-You can't hear?
-Nothing at all!

135
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,293
-Can you hear me?
-What?

136
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,253
-Can you hear me?
-What?

137
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,088
-Can you hear me?
-I can hear you!

138
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,384
This is where Waikiki starts.

139
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,053
Wow, nice.

140
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,263
-We're here!
-We're here, we're here.

141
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,765
-We're in Waikiki!
-Yes.

142
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,642
-Wow.
-Wow, it's a city.

143
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,769
-There's a lot of people.
-We're in the city.

144
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,272
-We are.
-Wow.

145
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,275
Wow, wow, wow!

146
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,902
-And this is Waikiki beach.
-Wow!

147
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,987
So this is it?

148
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,406
-Amazing!
-We're here!

149
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,409
-It's Waikiki!
-There's a lot of people though.

150
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,911
-There are.
-This is where tourists go.

151
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,832
Amazing. I want to go to the beach!

152
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,750
Amazing.

153
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,794
It's Waikiki.

-That.
-That?

162
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,013
-The one that looks like Naruto.
-It's anime.

163
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,224
-It's Naruto, right?
-It's Japanese anime.

164
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,934
-Anime is popular.
-It is?

165
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,440
Everything sounds good.

166
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,277
-Anything you recommend?
-I recommend...

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,156
the acai bowl, or granola, or oatmeal.

168
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,159
They have breakfast foods.

169
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,580
But they also have burgers, sandwiches
and salads, too.

170
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,583
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

171
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,462
Did you live with your parents
in Japan, Yuya?

172
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,797
Yeah.

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,882
What are your parents like?

174
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,926
They're divorced, but...

175
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,139
Yours are divorced, too.
So we all have divorced parents.

176
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,309
I'm the only person in my family
who doesn't speak English.

177
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:47,314
My older brother speaks English,
but not very well.

178
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,608
So I want to learn English.

179
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,776
What about yours, Lauren?

180
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,029
My mom is planning to remarry.

181
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,073
-Oh, how wonderful.
-Yeah, it happened recently.

182
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,701
-I'm really happy.
-About the new partner?

183
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,663
Yes. So my mom moved to Virginia.

184
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:08,335
So my grandma, older sister and I
are the only ones left in Hawaii.

185
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,128
-I see.
-And I have two older sisters.

186
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:15,091
So all your past boyfriends
have been American?

187
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,597
I was 14 when I was
with my first boyfriend.

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,475
He was Korean.

189
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,645
But it was fine
because he was fluent in English.

190
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,774
And I didn't really
have a serious boyfriend after that.

191
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,361
-It was just...
-Dating around?

192
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,948
I did go on dates,
but I didn't have a real boyfriend.

193
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,369
-There was a Japanese guy, too.
-Oh, really?

194
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,456
I saw someone while I was in Japan.

195
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,708
But he was...

196
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,756
Are you looking for a girlfriend?

197
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,466
-I am.
-You are?

198
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,217
I want a real girlfriend.

199
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,639
I was seeing someone for six years.

200
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,600
He was someone who took the lead.

201
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,561
He was a really good person.

202
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,898
I haven't been able to get over him.

203
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:19,030
I need to move on,
and I thought if I lived with guys...

204
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,659
I think this lifestyle will change you.

205
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,869
I'm trying to change.

206
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,414
Do you worry about work-related things?

207
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,292
I worry about succeeding in the art world.

208
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:35,422
I worry about making it professionally.

209
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,216
I was just thinking, she's totally...

210
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,635
Um...

211
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,346
-How do I put it?
-What?

212
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,392
You're scaring me.

213
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,145
-You can say it.
-Well...

214
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,106
She's someone who likes to be alone.
Does that make sense?

215
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,234
-Really?
-Yes, like drawing at home alone.

216
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,613
-You're okay being alone?
-I'm totally fine being alone.

217
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,908
-I don't get lonely.
-She's always thinking about something.

218
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,329
-Really? Do I look like I worry?
-So if you just...

219
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,415
You can tell us
if you're worried about something.

220
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,624
That's true.

221
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,002
I never tell guys what I'm worrying about.

222
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,214
-Yeah.
-You should definitely talk about it.

223
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,758
-I've been thinking that lately.
-Right?

224
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,595
Not everyone is the same, but...

225
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,514
I'd prefer it if a girl told me
she was worried.

226
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,226
-Okay, I'll make sure to talk to everyone.
-Yes.

227
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,394
I'll talk to everyone.

228
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,563
But sometimes it's better
to only talk to the girls.

229
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,565
-Yeah.
-That's true.

What's everybody drinking?

236
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,688
-Water for me.
-Water?

237
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,236
Water for me.
Should I go ask Eric and everyone?

238
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,987
-He'll want beer.
-Will you call everyone?

239
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,574
Me, too. I want to drink with him today.

240

-Where do you want to sit, Eric?
-Wow.

241
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,664
-It's a feast today.
-There are six cups.

242
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,291
-I'll take the middle.
-The middle?

243
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,668
Go ahead.

244
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,963
-Is Avian at work?
-Yeah, Avian's at work.

245
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,006
She said she's working until 7:30.

246
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,800
-Shall we eat?
-Let's eat.

247

-Let's eat.

00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,013
-What's this? Basil?
-That's pesto.

249

-Pesto?
-Pesto, Alfredo, tomato.

250
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,688
-This one?
-Yeah, I want that one.

251
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,773
Made with love.

252
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,817
-By Lauren.
-Yeah.

253
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,112
-It's homemade.
-Yes, homemade.

254
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,114
Is it good?

255
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,117
-It's good.
-Crazy?

256
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,828
-Really?
-Seriously. It's really good.

257
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,162
There's cheese, too.

258
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,541
-It's delicious.
-Let's dig in.

259
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,334
How was work today, Eric?

260
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,004
I was hammering nails all day.

261
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,049
-That's impressive.
-Yeah, seriously.

262
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,261
-For about nine hours straight.
-Nine hours?

263
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,138
When will the café be ready?

264
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,265
Maybe next year, to be honest.

265
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,350
-Next year?
-What kind of café will it be?

266
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,604
What kind of style do you want it to have?

267
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,064
-Hip.
-Hip?

268
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,525
A little Californian...

269
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,611
-Hip in that sense.
-How stylish.

270
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,865
-Sort of surfer-like.
-Sounds nice.

271
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,493
-Do you have a name for it?
-The name?

272
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,537
-Punch Bowl.
-Punch Bowl?

273
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,289
-Nice. It sounds hip.
-Very hip.

274
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,042
I'd like to make coffee there.

275
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,295
-You can? Seriously?
-Yeah, I can make latte art.

276
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,172
-You used to do it?
-I used to totally do it.

277
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,924
-Oh, really?
-So I've been wanting to do it.

278
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,260
What did the three of you do today?

279
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,805
-We totally connected today.
-Yeah, we did.

280
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,184
-Seriously?
-While we weren't there?

281
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,686
Do you have work tomorrow?

282
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,646
-I have work tomorrow.
-You have school?

283
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,899
I have school,
and then I'm off to the airport.

284
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,694
-That's right, the airport.
-That's right. It's goodbye.

285
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,654
Don't be so casual about it.

286
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,281
You could be a little sadder.

287
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,827
-How old are the other contestants?
-Everyone's a pro.

288
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,705
They're all adults.

289
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,707
-You're a pro.
-No, not at all.

290
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,835
It was really amazing.
I want to hear it again today.

291
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,671
-I want to hear it.
-Today, too?

292
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,883
-I got to listen earlier.
-What? That's so unfair!

293
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,135
-We should all see him off.
-Yeah.

294
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,471
No, that's not necessary.

295
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,182
I'll disappear on my own.

296
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,811
Don't say it like you're disappearing.

297
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,520
-Accept our offer.
-We'll see you off.

298
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,898
I feel bad. Thank you.

299
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,110
"I feel bad."

300
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,528
"I feel bad."

301
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,656
His Kyubey politeness.

302
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,825
They all went shopping, right?

303
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,037
And when they said they got close,
Yusuke seemed a little down.

304
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,832
Like he wanted to go, too.

305
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,084
Everyone else is getting closer
without him.

306
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,379
It reveals his inexperience with women.

307
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,007
-Does it?
-It makes him insecure.

308
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
-It's because he had school.
-Yeah.

309
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,428
Don't project yourself onto him.

310
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,181
That's true.
I was seeing myself in Yusuke.

311
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,726
I'm a little embarrassed now.

312
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,605
It's like I'm saying
that I rely on my talent, too.

313
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,649
He's talking to himself.

314
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:33,070
-He's talking a lot.
-We weren't reading that much into it.

315
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,822
You're not that similar.

316
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,115
My apologies.

317
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,618
My apologies.

318
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,329
We got to see
many sweet aspects of Lauren.

319
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,998
-We did.
-Very cute.

320
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,626
How can I put it?

321
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,712
The way she says, "What do you mean?"

322
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,588
This must have been
her first time cooking.

323
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,467
Her worried expression
while everyone ate...

324
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,136
That was extremely cute.

325
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,138
It was really cute.

326
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,141
That kind of expression by someone...

327
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,771
from a different cultural background
is really sweet.

328
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,941
-It's so nice.
-Hawaii's so nice.

329
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,402
-So the conclusion is, Hawaii is nice.
-That's the conclusion.

330
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,279
I can watch this forever.

331
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,159
-Water and beer, cheers.
-Cheers.

332
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,706
-Are you looking forward to college?
-College?

333
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,417
I don't have plans to go right now.

334
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,839
I'd like to head to Los Angeles after.

335
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,258
Why don't you go to
the music school, Berklee?

336
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,637
I did consider going there.

337
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,976
But it's expensive,
and it's also very far away.

338
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,312
What about you?
Are you planning on staying in Hawaii?

339
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,982
For now,
I'm planning on staying in Hawaii.

340
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,485
-For the café.
-Yes, for the café, too.

341
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,363
And while I'm living here...

342
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,866
Oh, here he comes.

343
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,243
-Nice work.
-I haven't worked.

344
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,038
-You took a shower already?
-I did.

345
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,332
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

346
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,960
Cheers.

347
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,671
I was planning on asking if there was

348
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,800
something you wanted to accomplish
while you're at Terrace House.

349
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,804
Learning to...

350
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,849
approach people.

351
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,852
But you're doing fine.

352
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,436
And to say the things I want to say.

353
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,149
-You mean to be more open?
-Yes, to be more open.

354
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,528
-And try to find inspiration to compose.
-Nice.

355
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,573
So you want to write a song
while you're here.

356
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:47,079
Are there things
you two want to accomplish?

357
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,414
While we're here...

358
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,291
First of all...

359
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,500
I'd like to learn to speak English.

360
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,295
Like a native speaker.

361
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,090
And to find a girlfriend.
Those are my goals.

362
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,967
You want a girlfriend, too, right?

363
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,510
-I do.
-You do, right?

364
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,554
-I do.
-Of course you do.

365
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,723
-If there's a nice girl, then of course.
-Yeah.

366
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,226
Are you the proactive type?
Or do you wait?

367
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,814
If I like her, then I go strong.

368
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,861
What was your ex like? What was she like?

369
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,447
She was originally a friend's girlfriend.

370
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,032
-Really?
-Yeah.

371
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,828
She said she had a change of heart
after she started coming to me for advice.

372
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,080
-She did?
-Yeah.

373
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,749
So we said we weren't together at first,

374
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:37,088
but we did things couples do
like go out on dates.

375
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,256
Is it that easy to have a change of heart?

376
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,552
I was surprised. She said her feelings
changed after about a week.

377
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,762
-One week? That's quick.
-One week?

378
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,349
You should try
going out with someone, Yusuke.

379
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,267
What about your ex?
Oh, right, you've never had one.

380
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,313
-You knew that already!
-You knew that already.

381
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,232
A man has to be proactive.

382
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,109
Yeah.

383
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,736
Nothing's gonna happen
unless you take action.

384
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,115
-That's true.
-Yeah.

385
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,878
-These are so cute.
-I really like these balls.

386
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,755
I love them, too.
Where should I put these?

387
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,299
It's fine here.

388
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,597
Another round.

389
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,477
Do you drink regularly?

390
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,104
-Or not really?
-Not really.

391
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,772
-I see.
-Cheers.

392
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,524
Only for special occasions then?

393
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,777
Well...

394
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,657
I don't really enjoy getting drunk,
so I only drink when I'm socializing.

395
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,204
-I don't normally drink alone.
-I see.

396
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,207
-This is really relaxing.
-Yes.

397
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,959
It's great.

398
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,752
The view here is great, isn't it?

399
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,547
Yeah, it's super pretty over there.

400
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,176
-I love the mornings best.
-The mornings are nice, too.

401
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,638
It's easy to drink here.

402
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,309
It's so refreshing, it's hard to stop.

403
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,146
Maybe I'll go get the Chemex tomorrow.

404
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,480
-What's that?
-From the office.

405
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,068
It's the coffee maker
shaped like an hourglass.

406
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,527
Now I'm curious.

407
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,904
-Let's use it at home.
-Yes, we should.

408
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:31,035
I don't really drink alone,
but I'll drink if there are people around.

409
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,704
There's only me or Avian.

410
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,497
Avian doesn't drink, right?

411
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,709
-So I'm your only drinking buddy.
-Yeah.

412
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,545
I'll keep you company.

413
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,589
Really? I'm gonna take you up on that.

414
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,508
I might ask often.

415
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,844
-Like, "Let's drink."
-Sure.

416
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,514
I'm not a fan of Japanese drinks,
but if its beer or wine...

417
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:56,435
Then let's go buy a nice wine next time.

418
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,199
-Am I the only one swimming?
-Wait. We're getting ready.

419
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,783
We're coming in.

420
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,953
Girls need time to prepare.

421
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,221
Ah, it's so cold!

422
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,976
-Let's play a game.
-Sure! Which?

423
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,895
If you flip over, you lose.

424
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,564
No way! I'll definitely lose.

425
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,941
Here she comes.

426
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,298
-Terrace House...
-Yeah, it's amazing.

427
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,095
This pool feels so nice.

428
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,974
Yusuke.

429
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,729
-You want Yusuke?
-Yeah, let's call him.

430
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,815
Ask him to play guitar.

431
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,359
-Okay. Sure.
-Tell him we want him.

432
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,695
-You hear him play, right?
-Every day.

433
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,697
-That's so unfair!
-I heard him yesterday, too.

434
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,574
The girls don't get to hear him.

435
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,867
It's warm.

436
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,165
Play, play.

437
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,722
Being this up close is so awesome.

438
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,993
Something like that.

439
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,538
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

440
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,124
Thank you.

441
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,210
-It's like I'm working here.
-What do you mean?

442
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,839
-I enjoyed it very much.
-Did you?

443
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,466
Going to Japan for three days!
-Yusuke

444
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,842
What about up there?

445
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,928
How about the skinny one?

446
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,682
Can I look at this?

447
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,983
It's really good.

448
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,238
-It's just a hobby for now.
-Really? This?

449
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,991
-You haven't gone to art school?
-No, I haven't.

450
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:02,204
I've loved drawing ever since I was two.

451
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,039
You should do it more.

452
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,418
Thank you. I plan to study it in school.

453
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,878
I plan to go to one in New York.

454
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,214
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

455
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,646
How do you come up with the idea?

456
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,899
-I like it, so I'm always drawing.
-Randomly?

457
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,526
Randomly.

458
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,028
If I feel like it, I'll draw.

459
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,449
And I always feel like it,
so I'm always drawing.

460
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,326
You'll definitely keep improving.

461
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:49,042
I'm going running for a bit.

462
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,628
-Okay.
-Real running this time.

463
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,888
That's so cool!

464
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,183
-Editing is cool.
-It's so cool.

465
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,144
-It's like in the movies.
-Something's just different.

466
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,481
Even though they were just talking
about walking or running.

467
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,316
The content is crap...

468
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
-but they look good on-screen.
-They do.

469
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,779
Yuya was a little tough on Aizawa.

470
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,615
He finally ragged on him.

471
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,493
-He finally did it.
-It was light teasing.

472
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,119
Like classmate banter.

473
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,830
"What about your ex?
Oh, right, you've never had one."

474
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,458
That's really annoying.

475
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,169
Yusuke was taking it well.
Like, "You knew that already!"

476
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:38,384
He knew what he was doing.
It's annoying when he's condescending.

477
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,971
An empty-headed person
who only ever relied on his looks...

478
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,516
Don't underestimate the virgin,
you man whore.

479
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,810
"Don't underestimate the virgin,
you man whore."

480
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,439
What a fine phrase.

481
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:56,026
Isn't everyone sort of...

482
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,946
With regards to his guitar and ukulele,
aren't they kind of using him?

483
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,156
Well, yeah.

484
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,951
Like they're asking him to play
just for the atmosphere.

485
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,328
Like, "Hey, boy, play for us."

486
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,248
He is kind of like their younger brother.

487
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,668
He's like a younger brother,
and they want to hear it.

488
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,671
It'd be interesting if Yusuke exploded.

489
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,173
"I don't want to anymore!"

490
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,801
And he uses his guitar to beat them.

491
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,888
He cracked a joke about it himself.
"It's like I'm working here."

492
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,766
-He looks so cool when he's playing.
-So cool.

493
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,061
-He looks completely different.
-His expression.

494
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,647
Only Eric and Naomi can drink.

495
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,858
And that vibe. They're both...

496
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,695
The whole "I'll be the barista
at your café" thing...

497
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,532
It's a good foundation
for something to happen.

498
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,116
And if only the two of them drink,

499
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,495
they'll probably talk about
a lot of things when they're buzzed.

500
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,499
-Things might happen.
-They'll get closer.

501
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,627
Eric and Lauren, too...

502
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,755
they have a common interest in art.

503
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,342
Lauren feels like the star of the show.

504
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,386
-That's true.
-Things seem to be spinning around Lauren.

505
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,618
Wow, it's so stylish.

506
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,285
-Really?
-Yeah, it's stylish.

507
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,622
You don't think it's too rigid?

508
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,124
-No.
-This is the window.

509
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,002
This is the shelf.

510
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,255
The sign will be here.

511
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,174
I think that's good.
You can see everything.

512
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,678
-I'll try it.
-Okay.

513
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,729
Coming?

514
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,945
-Let's go.
-Okay.

515
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,656
We're going for a run.

516
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,199
-Good luck.
-Good luck?

517
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,952
Good luck.

518
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,788
-Running?
-Running.

519
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,707
-Have fun!
-See you!

520
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,112
Should we go right?

521
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,784
-I'm tired.
-You're tired? So am I.

522
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,243
It's so pretty.

523
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,765
-Is here okay?
-Yeah.

524
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,560
Good job.

525
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,355
There's something I wanted to ask you.

526
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,274
-You mentioned that.
-Yeah, one question.

527
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,861
You seem nervous. What is it?

528
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,696
I think it'll be hard for you to answer.

529
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,280
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

530
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,533
-Bye.
-Why?

531
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:38,624
Have you talked about
which of the guys you like best?

532
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,042
On first impression?

533
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,254
-Who do I like the best?
-Yeah.

534
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,258
Is there someone you like
out of the guys right now?

535
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,802
That's tough. Everyone has good features.

536
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,763
Today, I thought...

537
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,768
"If I took this part of Yusuke,

538
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:02,355
and took this part of Yuya,
and this part of Eric..."

539
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,651
-If you combined them, it'd be perfect?
-Yeah, it'd be nice.

540
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,695
I'm starting to see
everyone's personality.

541
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,199
-You're starting to see?
-I think so, but...

542
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,826
I'm not sure yet.

543
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,167
It's nice to talk one-on-one.

544
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,878
-Since we haven't before.
-No, we haven't.

545
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,016
Should we head home? I'm tired.

546
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,269
-Should we?
-Yeah, let's.

547
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,279
-I'm going to sleep well.
-Should we run?
