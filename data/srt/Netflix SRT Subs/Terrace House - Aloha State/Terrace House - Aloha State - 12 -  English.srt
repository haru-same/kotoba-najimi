1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,097
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,476
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,187
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,481
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,401
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:31,699
Let's see, last week...
Oh, the new member, Tamaki!

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,491
-Taishi.
-Taishi.

8
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:37,245
I work as an actor in Hollywood.

9
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,626
-How long have you lived there?
-A year and a half, almost two.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,461
What do you plan on doing in Hawaii?

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,840
I plan on falling in love in Hawaii.

12
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,468
Falling in love is great motivation.

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,721
He's a passionate man.

14
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,808
Anna showed him around Waikiki
and they had lunch together.

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,227
He also invited Lauren to lunch.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,520
-He's a man of action.
-Yes.

17
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,314
You have a beautiful face.

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,657
-Lauren seemed quite happy about it.
-That's right.

19
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,535
And from his conversations
with both Lauren and Anna...

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,582
I would give him 100%

21
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,836
-Yes, he's very likeable.
-Very mature.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,966
Just as it seemed like everything was
peachy at Terrace House,

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,426
a terrible incident--
Sorry, I can't help but laugh.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,303
You seem so happy.

25
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,806
It's just so entertaining.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,683
-Yuya and Avian...
-Was there?

27
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,601
The basketball incident, Torichan!

28
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,520
Let's go out on a date.

29
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,897
A Christmas date.

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,274
I don't know. I can't think of anything.

31
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,067
I'll come up with some options.

32
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,653
What would be good?

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,698
I want to have Christmas dinner.

34
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,075
What would be good?

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,453
-Things like that happen sometimes.
-Do they?

36
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,041
Because the moment
she really started liking Yuya,

37
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,670
he was like, "You're coming on too strong,
old hag. Gross."

38
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,839
-He said no such thing!
-You've added to it.

39
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,841
-Wasn't it like that?
-Not at all.

40
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,426
Like, "Old hag!" and then, wham!

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,847
-There was no "old hag, wham!"
-There was none of that.

42
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,975
-But Ken, too...
-Yeah.

43
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,563
For her to say she's his Cinderella
while Yuya is feeling that way...

44
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,481
It's like, "Cinderella?"

45
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,233
Such a realist!

46
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,319
It's very real.

47
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,155
It's fine if you're both
at the same emotional place.

48
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,825
These are all just our conjectures.

49
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:42,037
In reality, maybe we had Yuya all wrong.

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,707
-He is empty-headed after all.
-You're being harsh.

51
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,210
Maybe he just happened
to have less energy.

52
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,840
Maybe he happened to be at the sad part
of the manga he's reading.

53
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,259
So he answered with that vibe.

54
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,679
-How simple of him!
-It's a possibility.

55
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,726
-Things may be clarified today.
-Maybe.

56
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,561
-You're working tomorrow, too?
-Yes, tomorrow, too.

57
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,688
-Can I come visit?
-Sure.

58
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,689
Come.

59
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,443
They made lunch plans, too.

60
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,156
And Eric...
when are you going to finish your store?

-It is.

-It's pretty big.
-I'm surprised.

-Yeah, it is.

-Recommendations?

70
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,244
This one's popular.

71
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,412
Diamond Head.

72
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,581
I see. Nice, it's cute.

73
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,292
What about this one?

74
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,085
I was just thinking that.

75
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,171
It's in gray, too.

76
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,548
Maybe I'll buy it.

77
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,967
-Which color do you want?
-This one.

78
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,136
It's a gift from me.

79
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,930
What?

80
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,431
Seriously?

81
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,684
-Are you sure?
-That's why I was pushing you to get two.

82
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,896
-Seriously? Are you sure?
-Sure.

83
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,690
Well, then I'm grateful.

84
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,819
-I'll pay for lunch.
-Don't worry about it.

85
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,112
No, I'll pay. I'd feel too bad otherwise.

86
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,864
-Are you sure though?
-Yeah.

87
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,158
Should we go eat? It's noon.

88
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,535
-Should I wait outside?
-Yeah.

89
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,793
-This is a nice place.
-Yeah.

90
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,088
-And the weather's so nice today.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,506
This is cute.

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,508
Maybe I'll work at a place like this.

93
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,510
-I think that'll be good.
-Yeah?

94
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,221
-Looks so good.
-Right?

95
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,014
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

96
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,185
Omelet...

97
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,021
-How is it?
-It's good.

98
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,106
Is it?

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,733
It's good!

100
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,819
I feel so good.

101
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,904
It's good, isn't it?

102
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,909
Good food, good weather...

103
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,911
I love Hawaii.

104
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,166
What did you study in college?

105
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,504
Graphic design and business.

106
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,838
I also studied management.

107
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,465
You studied in Shanghai...

108
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,261
-for two or four years?
-Four years.

109
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,764
I studied Chinese and some business.

110
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,933
And then you went to Los Angeles?

111
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,601
Los Angeles and then Shanghai.

112
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,271
So LA was first. What did you study there?

113
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,274
I studied graphic design in LA.

114
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,985
Have you ever dated an American?

115
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,695
-Yes.
-Have you dated someone Japanese?

116
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,739
-A Japanese guy?
-No, not Japanese.

117
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,618
-So you don't have experience with them?
-No, I don't.

118
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,662
You seem like the type to commit.

119
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,124
Maybe. Well, I'm not sure.

120
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,002
-You seem like you'd be a good mom.
-A good mom?

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,130
A mom? What do you mean?

122
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,675
-I don't know if that's good or bad.
-It's good.

123
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,218
It's a good thing.

124
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,559
What did you talk about today?

125
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,228
With Avian? Well...

126
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,523
why she came to Terrace House,

127
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,026
what type of person she's dated...

128
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,112
-and vice versa.
-Wait.

129
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,240
-You've had lunch with each of the girls?
-I have.

130
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,951
I'm a little tired.

131
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,911
Going out for lunch
on consecutive days is tiring.

132
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,122
Having gone out with each of them,

133
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,833
who made the best impression?

134
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,876
-Best impression?
-Well, I mean...

135
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:03,131
Having gone out with them,
did you feel anything?

136
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:07,302
Well, I felt more with Anna.

137
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:12,224
I think she is the most similar...

138
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,103
to the type of girls I have dated.

139
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,858
-Are you having boy talk?
-You can join.

140
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,403
I don't want to interrupt.

141
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,492
You should have
some of the soup Lauren made.

142
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,744
Really? Can I have some?

143
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,996
-Sure.
-Thanks.

144
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,748
-It was good.
-What did you do today, Lauren?

145
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,917
I went to art class and drew a nude--

146
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,464
Well, it's not really a class,
but there was a nude model.

147
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,093
-Oh, you mentioned that.
-The model holds a pose for ten minutes.

148
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,970
Are they totally naked?

149
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,225
You want to try?

150
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,979
-There's no way.
-No way!

151
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,482
You guys are downstairs?
You've been home?

152
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,234
-I just got back.
-Oh, really?

153
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,986
-Did you pass by upstairs?
-I did.

154
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,612
No way. I didn't notice.

155
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,950
You're dressed in mellow colors today.

156
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,704
-I was at hula earlier.
-I see.

157
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,457
Do you have an early day tomorrow?

158
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,253
No plans apart from surfing.

159
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,839
Then let's talk, Taishi,
just the two of us.

160
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,592
Sure. Should we go somewhere?

161
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,096
-Outside? Do you think it's cold?
-I think it's fine.

162
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,557
Let's go outside.

163
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,604
How can we get out... from here?

164
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,191
I wonder if it's raining.
There was a little on my way back.

165
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,483
I don't think it is.

166
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,530
-It might be a little cold though.
-Right?

167
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,700
It's winter. It's been really cold lately.

168
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,162
The wind is so cold!

169
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,623
Are you okay? Do you need a blanket?

170
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,125
I do. Do you have one?

171
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,587
-I'll go get one. Hold on.
-Thank you.

172
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,797
So cold!

173
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,388
-Here.
-Thank you.

174
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,265
-It looks super warm.
-Is it yours?

175
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,725
No, it was here.

176
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,271
Thank you. It's so warm!

177
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,149
-It almost looks hot, actually.
-Not at all.

178
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,944
Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

179
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,074
I wanted to talk about the girls.

180
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,867
The other two girls...

181
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,413
have been living together
for two and a half months.

182
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,250
They've formed a relationship.

183
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,837
It's a little tough to break into that.

184
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,882
-It's tough being a girl.
-And...

185
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,927
even though they both speak Japanese,
they're not Japanese.

186
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,890
-That's right, neither one is Japanese.
-Yes!

187
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:03,270
When I hear them speaking in English
in the bathroom...

188
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,315
I'll unconsciously decide not to go in.

189
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,942
-I see.
-Yeah.

190
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,154
You and I came around the same time.

191
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,198
The same day, actually.

192
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,662
So I wanted to talk to you
and hear your thoughts as well.

193
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,997
It's tough at first.

194
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,419
To be honest, this is the most stress
I've felt in my life.

195
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,254
Seriously?

196
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,756
Is there something you want to do here?

197
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,634
What are you thinking?

198
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,221
I do think I should spend more time
with them.

199
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,057
Yeah, talking with only me
and talking with everyone

200
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,892
are totally different things.

201
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:47,104
So I think... it's just the beginning.

202
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,608
Yeah, it's just the beginning.

203
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,196
-We just started.
-Yeah.

204
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,658
It's gotten a little chilly.

205
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,161
-Should we go in?
-Should we?

206
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,289
Thanks for bringing this.
Will you take it back?

207
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,291
-Sure.
-Thanks.

208
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,001
-I've got the coffee.
-Are you okay? Need a hug?

209
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,717
-Hugs are important.
-Thank you.

00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,065
-For now...
-For now.

218
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,610
Will it stand?

219
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,333
-This is fine.
-Should we flip it?

220
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,296
This is fine.

221
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,466
I'll be looking forward
to what it'll look like at 6:00.

222
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,343
-Okay, thanks.
-Are you okay?

223
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,429
We're good.

224
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,850

-We're cheering you on.

225
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,397
-Later. See you later.
-I'll treat you guys.

226
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,731
Thanks.

227
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,291
-It's finished.
-It is.

228
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,294
-Nice work.
-Good work.

229
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,089
-You're going to have coffee makers?
-Yeah.

230
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:19,841
Nice.

231
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,136
-It's finally done.
-Nice work.

232
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,475
-A long road?
-A seriously long road.

233
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,236
Thank you.

234
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,702
Thank you!

235
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,295
Did you see Lauren's work?

236
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,259
It's so cute!

YUSUKE AIZAWA, 18 YEARS OLD

238
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,142
How are you? Long time no see!

239
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,437
It's nice to meet you.

240
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,648
-Taishi?
-Taishi, nice to meet you.

241
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,359
-I heard a lot about you.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Anna.

242
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,536
I brought you a little food.

243
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,037
-Seriously?
-You two, eat.

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,622
We're so hungry.

245
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,290
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

246
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,710
How's school, everything, life?

247
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,088
I'm so busy. There's so much to do.

248
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,007
-How's the music?
-Music?

249
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,343
I'm going to Japan next year.

250
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,304
Seriously? When?

251
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:53,350
In May, the day after I graduate.
I'm going to Tokyo.

252
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,606
-We're going to get dinner!
-Bye, Eric!

253
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,900
-Thank you very much!
-See you later!

254
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,944
-See you! Good luck!
-Thanks!

255
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,737
Good luck!

256
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,079
Thanks for yesterday.

257
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,164
-It meant a lot...
-No problem.

258
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,124
...your help.

259
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,045
If you and Taishi weren't there,

260
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,756
the opening would've been delayed
by three hours.

261
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,345
It doesn't feel like I'm leaving today.

262
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,180
You don't have to leave.

263
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,604
I'm glad that someone like you was
at Terrace House.

264
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,606
That's my line.

265
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,819
We messed around most of the time.

266
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,154
You were the only one
I could mess around with.

267
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,035
Are you good on time?

268
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,788
I guess I should get going soon.

269
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,179
See ya.

270
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,682
See ya.

271
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,910
-What's that?
-You already know, don't you?

272
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,163
-You saw it, right?
-I didn't, I didn't.

273
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,164
Here.

274
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,208
Oh, man!

275
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,420
Thank you.

276
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,173
Seriously, thank you.

277
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,344
I...

278
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,599
What's wrong?

279
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,021
I shouldn't be the one crying.

280
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,732
No worries.

281
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,110
He's been crying all morning.

282
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,029
-Really?
-Yeah.

283
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,823
-Really?
-All morning.

284
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm glad I met you.

285
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,749
-I think it's toughest on Yuya.
-Me, too.

286
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,544
-Please keep in touch with him.
-I definitely will.

287
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,966
He really thinks of you as a brother.

288
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
-I do, too.
-Really.

289
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,764
-Thank you, Eric.
-You, too.

290
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,560
I should get going then.

291
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,024
Well, my bag...

292
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,488
A false start.

293
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,283
-It wasn't a hug.
-Thank you.

294
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,329
It's not really goodbye.

295
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,583
-Bye, Eric. Thank you.
-Thank you.

296
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,012
-See you.
-See you.

297
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,973
Be well.

298
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,815
-See you.
-See you!

299
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,622
ENOSHIMA, KANAGAWA

300
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,628
CHIGASAKI, KANAGAWA

301
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,962
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-Yeah.

302
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,463
-Are you gonna take it?
-Yeah.

303
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,009
Thank you.

304
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,928
-So I should return it?
-Yeah.

305
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,933
-If you break it...
-If I break it? That can't be helped.

306
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:06,437
I thought it'd be interesting
to be in the competitions there.

307
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,398
-You're okay living with a group?
-With a group?

308
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,275
-Maybe you're used to it.
-Yeah.

309
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,444
-But it's with girls, right?
-Yeah.

310
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,572
But I'm not too worried, to be honest.

311
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,993
You're going to have to interact
with the girls.

312
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,205
-Yeah.
-I've seen the show a little.

313
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,792
You have to establish
your personal life there.

314
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,797
It'll be great if you can balance it
with surfing.

315
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,592
-He finally finished.
-He finally did.

316
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,679
He spent a long time on it
and it was... that.

317
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,890
You stop that.

318
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,853
The inside of that counter was amazing.

319
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:51,565
-The way the bottle moves across?
-It's very high-tech.

320
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,318
There were only two things on the menu,
hot coffee and iced coffee.

321
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,280
-You be quiet.
-It was really just a soft opening.

322
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,782
Are you sure?

323
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,244
And Anna, since she and Taishi
are both new members,

324
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,997
opened up to him
and told him her anxieties.

325
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,958
He said, "Are you okay?
Do you need a hug?"

326
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,752
-He's so sweet.
-"Thank you."

327
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,045
He did do that.

328
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,757
-He seemed to have an ulterior motive.
-Definitely.

329
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,763
He mentioned right before
that Anna is like the girls he's dated.

330
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,223
He did say they tended to be like Anna.

331
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:30,271
Of course he's worried, sincerely worried,
hence the hug.

332
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:35,985
If the hug means more, then so be it.

333
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,822
-There was that.
-There was a little of that.

334
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:45,369
But before that, when she says she wants
to talk to him alone,

335
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:49,999
there was a quick shot
of only Lauren's head.

336
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,545
She had a cushion.
She didn't take her head off.

337
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,257
"I'm going to the bathroom.
Continue talking."

338
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,633
The body went to the bathroom.

339
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,679
It's connected by Bluetooth.

340
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,222
-Bluetooth?
-Bluetooth.

341
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,099
-Really?
-How very advanced.

342
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,602
Lauren Tsai.
Even the name sounds like a mobile suit.

343
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,981
-That's true.
-So the body is Tsai?

344
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:18,861
There's a hint
that Lauren might like Tamaki.

345
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,947
-Just a hint.
-Yes, there is.

346
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,699
They did seem like they had fun.

347
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,118
Their first outing was nice.

348
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,871
It's like she's totally forgotten
about Yusuke.

349
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,250
-That's not true.
-Completely forgotten.

350
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,545
It's like, "The chubby one's gone.
The hot one's here. Yay!"

351
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,422
Chubby out, hot in!

352
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,300
Stop that.

353
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:46,180
And after the pop-up party,
he said he would leave.

354
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,517
And now we have a new member from Shonan.

355
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,355
-From Chigasaki.
-A surfer.

356
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,774
The place where Terrace House began.

357
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,194
He did seem attractive.

358
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,447
I'm looking forward
to seeing the top half of his face.

359
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,911
-Okay, ready.
-Nice.

360
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:13,165
-It finally feels like Christmas here.
-Doesn't it?

361
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,917
Ready? Go!

362
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,795
This is fun.

363
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,673
-I love this stuff.
-I won't lose!

364
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,385
Lauren looks like she doesn't.

365
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,721
-She's making tea.
-No, no.

366
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,018
-I'm a little out of it because I'm sick.
-You should rest.

367
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,436
Two, four, six, eight.

368
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,563
-I don't understand these two.
-Be quiet!

369
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,940
Be quiet.

370
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,443
The task was a little tedious,
so we made it into a race.

371
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,529
-Seriously?
-Two, four, six...

372
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,947
Watch out!

373
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,418
That's cute.

374
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,128
-Why won't you respond?
-Oh, me?

375
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,506
No way!

376
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,758
Now?

377
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,135
Who is it?

378
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,474
The tree looks really good! It's cute.

379
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,019
-Seriously?
-Get ready everyone.

380
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,478
-I'm getting nervous.
-Oh, man.

381
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,940
-I'm getting really nervous.
-Everybody get ready.

382
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,026
I'll go get the door.
It's a new guy, right?

383
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,195
Get ready.

384
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,824
-Good evening!
-Good evening!

385
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,789
Wow, he's got a surfboard.

386
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,128
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

387
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,047
Amazing.

388
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,674
Excuse me.

389
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,553
-It's nice to meet you. I'm Guy.
-Guy?

390
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,598
-Are you a surfer?
-Yes, I'm a pro surfer.

391
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,434
-Seriously?
-I work at the beach.

392
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,810
Are you from Hawaii?

393
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,855
No, I'm from Shonan.

394
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,857
From Shonan?

395
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,947
-You arrived today?
-Yes, this afternoon.

396
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,367
-How old are you?
-I just turned 20.

397
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,951
Oh, 20.

398
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,455
-So you can drink then.
-Not over here.

399
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,290
-Oh, you can't!
-That's right.

400
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,666
GUY SATO, 20 YEARS OLD
PRO SURFER

401
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,293
How long have you surfed?

402
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,629
It's been 15 years already.

403
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,299
-Fifteen years?
-I've surfed since I was five.

404
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,135
Competitions?

405
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,678
Yes, I've been in many.

406
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,725
So if I look up "Guy, surfer,"
you'd come up?

407
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,060
I think so.

408
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,607
-Have you been to Hawaii before?
-I used to come every year.

409
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,067
-I see.
-For surfing?

410
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:49,905
Yes, ever year I'd mainly go
to the North Shore.

411
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,365
-For competitions?
-Yeah.

412
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,118
Insane! Let's have him teach us all.

413
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,871
I surf, but only as a hobby.

414
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,916
I saw you surf on TV.

415
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,876
The level is totally different!

416
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,463
You looked like you were enjoying it.

417
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,302
Did you get your tan
from surfing in Japan?

418
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,888
From the sun in different places.

419
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:21,312
-So you've surfed in different places?
-Yes, different places.

420
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,606
-For competitions, you mean?
-Yes, mainly competitions.

421
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,401
Amazing!

422
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,321
Should we finish the tree first?

423
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,365
-I agree.
-We're decorating the tree right now.

424
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,577
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

425
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,081
Do you plan to surf here?

426
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,084
-Here?
-Mainly competitions?

427
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,586
Yes, I plan to attack the big wave.

428
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,839
-The pipeline?
-How cool!

429
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:53,009
-My sponsor's house is right in front.
-Oh, Volcom!

430
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,637
-Volcom house!
-Oh, Volcom.

431
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,475
They were saying
the pro surfers stay there.

432
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:05,021
-But, wow, a pro at 20.
-Yeah, definitely.

433
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:08,442
When did you start competing?

434
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,195
When I was about seven or eight.

435
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:17,075
-What made you start surfing?
-What made me start?

436
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,869
-You were five.
-Yes.

437
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,831
-Your dad...
-Yes, the usual. My dad used to surf.

438
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:27,544
-Isn't this starting to look messy?
-That's what's cute!

439
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,633
Amazing! It's finished!

440
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,346
-A pro surfer...
-Do you want to see the boards?

441
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,181
Can I? I want to see.

442
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,603
Nothing weird should come out.

443
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,356
It would be amazing if something did.

444
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,192
Oh, you have it all wrapped.

445
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,652
Wow.

446
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,862
Seems very professional.

447
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,743
This is the one you always use?

448
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,789
Yeah, but I use all of them.

449
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,832
Amazing.

450
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:11,922
-These are your sponsors?
-Yes, clothing...

451
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,259
-Wow.
-Yuya, your school...

452
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,344
How long are you going for?

453
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:22,349
I haven't decided,
but no later than March.

454
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:27,396
No later than March?
So you can do that?

455
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,523
It's nice that you can study English.

456
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,485
I want to go, too.
Can I go just like that?

457
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,405
You'd have to start next session,
but I think so.

458
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,907
I want to try different things right now.

459
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,997
So that's why you came to Terrace House?
You want a challenge?

460
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,876
Well, not challenge myself, but...

461
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,837
I thought it'd be a good opportunity

462
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,673
to experience
what other people experience.

463
00:27:55,466 --> 00:28:00,721
I'm 20, but the past 15 years
have been about surfing.

464
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,099
I want other passions, too.

465
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,894
Is it your first time living
with girls and guys?

466
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,396
Yes, it is.

467
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,148
By the way,
what kind of girl is your type?

468
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,318
I like girls who are a little quirky.

469
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,945
-Natural?
-Natural?

470
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,824
What about looks?
Do you prefer someone cute or cool?

471
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,995
-The girly type.
-Me, too.

472
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,665
-You're rivals?
-Are we?

473
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,252
I can't afford to lose.

474
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,672
-This seems like it'll be fun.
-It is.

475
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,636
-He's so cute! Guy.
-He's a good guy.

476
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,721
All I hear is "Cute! So cute!"

477
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,766
-He's cute.
-It's comforting.

478
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,351
I want one at home!

479
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,397
-You want a Guy at home?
-Yes, one at home.

480
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,148
I want him to say, "Welcome home!"

481
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,693
Another kind of Guy will appear
in the middle of the night, Torichan.

482
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,446
Night Guy? Seriously?

483
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,114
Night Guy?

484
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,950
Night Guy is going to be something.

485
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,454
He talks with that slow pace,

486
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,040
but when he surfs...

487
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,875
Oh, that contrast!

488
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:17,172
All the girls are imagining him
attacking the big wave.

489
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,174
I see, I see.

490
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:23,429
He speaks with a lisp
and seems a little nervous.

491
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,724
-He's cute when he smiles.
-He is.

492
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,060
I want to give him a rice ball.

493
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,813
Like, "Here, good luck."

494
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,523
"Here, good luck."

495
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,317
"Thanks for the rice ball.

496
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:41,322
It was really tasty.

497
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:47,536
I like pickled sour plums inside.
Thank you."

498
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,038
It's so cute!

499
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,207
I wonder what he's like when he surfs.

500
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,377
-I wanna see!
-Like, "Oh, Guy, you're so different."

501
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,671
I'm sure.

502
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,465
He's going to be amazing.

503
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:04,886
We've had some surfing scenes.
Some of the members surfed.

504
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,138
-But this is on a different level.
-I'm sure.

505
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,809
Like, "Wait, Guy, you're on a sea turtle!"

506
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,482
He doesn't even need a board.

507
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,609
This isn't about
whether he's good or not anymore.

508
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,069
He's like Urashima Taro
from the folk legend.

509
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,530
But he brought all his boards.

510
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,783
"There was a turtle,
so I rode the turtle."

511
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,329
"I rode the turtle."

512
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,539
I wanna see that scene.

513
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,334
-Will they have the turtle scene?
-I want him to ride a turtle.

514
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,754
-It would be so cute.
-They all like the girly type.

515
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,341
-Is Anna the only girly one of the three?
-For now.

516
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,968
So there might be a battle.

517
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,887
Will there be?

518
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,723
-What about Yuya and Avian?
-They seemed fine.

519
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,392
What was that all about?

520
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,894
I told you so.

521
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,855
Did you say that, Torichan?

522
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,400
So it was just his mood.

523
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,193
Damn you for making me hope.

524
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,279
I hope he confesses his feelings to her.

525
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,906
How will the episode end?

526
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,117
Right as he's about to attack a big wave,
it'll end.

527
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,245
-End on the attack?
-Then it would be a surfing show.

528
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,295
ANNA HANEISHI, 22 YEARS OLD

'16 GRADUATED COLLEGE
LAST RELATIONSHIP: 2 YEARS AGO

532
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,937
-Avian, I'm sorry I'm late!
-That's all right.

533
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,146
-Did you wait long?
-No, it's fine.

534
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,151
Wow! I've never been here.

535
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:47,656
-It's our date.
-That's true. This is a date spot.

536
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,158
Did you make plans for Christmas?
The 24th?

537
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,620
The 24th... It's tomorrow, right?

538
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,999
-It's tomorrow!
-You're going to dinner and...

539
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,419
-And ice skating.
-That's right!

540
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,881
We're gonna go ice skating
and then we'll probably go for dinner.

541
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,884
So there isn't anyone specific
you want to be with?

542
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,471
Hanging out with Taishi is fun.

543
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,598
You should go on dates with each of them.

544
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,104
Wow!

545
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,231
Wow!

546
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,775
It's so romantic!

547
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,153
This is totally a date.

548
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:31,366
Are you going to surf on Christmas, too?

549
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,452
What are your plans?

550
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:37,623
-If there are waves, I'd like to.
-I'm sure it'll be fine in the morning.

551
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,541
How old were you when you turned pro?

552
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,753
-I was in seventh grade.
-So young!

553
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,507
-You're at the top?
-I'm ranked about 15th.

554
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,716
-15th?
-Amazing!

555
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,468
This year.

556
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,762
It makes me disappointed in myself.

557
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,349
-Why?
-It makes me think I need to work harder.

558
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,936
You're 20, right? It's amazing.

559
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,732
But surfing on Christmas is a little sad,
isn't it?

560
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,150
What about you, Taishi?

561
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,652
Me?

562
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:11,406
I'm interested in Anna right now.

563
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,785
-The one who came on the same day as you?
-Yeah. She's cute.

564
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,203
Anna, huh?

565
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,956
Were you nervous when you asked Avian out?

566
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,211
-I didn't ask her out. She asked me.
-Oh, really?

567
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,631
But I was embarrassed.

568
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:31,635
I was cold to her out of embarrassment.

569
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,636
I know what you mean.

570
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:38,141
I tend to say the opposite of what I mean
to hide my embarrassment.

571
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:44,230
But it's already Christmas.
I'm hoping to tell her how I feel now.

572
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,483
For me, the things to look out for
would be...

573
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,862
to always open the car door for her...

574
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,489
or to pull out the chair for her.

575
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:58,203
Guys, especially Japanese guys,
are hesitant to do that kind of thing.

576
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:03,374
I've gotten better
since I moved to the US.

577
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:08,964
But truly treating women
like they're women in this way...

578
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,843
seems to make them happy.

579
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:17,639
It helps to focus on them
and not on yourself.

580
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:21,768
Focus on their happiness
instead of your own embarrassment.

581
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:26,147
It makes it easier.
If you think of how happy it'll make her,

582
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,193
you'll want to do it
even if it's embarrassing.

583
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,446
-That's really great.
-What if it doesn't make her happy?

584
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:37,200
-That's why dating is scary.
-Yeah.

585
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,910
I've failed so many times because of it.

586
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,496
I know it can be really scary.

587
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,999
But that's what I came here to do,
so you should to.

588
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,541
You're right.

589
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,210
So what if you get hurt?

590
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,343
So you both like each other.

591
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,263
I wonder...
I'm just kidding. That's a lie.

592
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,686
What made you like Yuya?

593
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,229
His personality.

594
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,357
I like people who are sweet.

595
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,236
But he gets embarrassed easily.

596
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,822
-Yuya? Does he?
-Really embarrassed.

597
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:21,620
His tone can be harsh,
but he doesn't really think that way.

598
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,748
His words can be harsh,
but he's just hiding his embarrassment.

599
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,210
-He's sweet.
-But you're not going out?

600
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,755
Yeah. The timing...

601
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,217
Won't it happen on your Christmas date?

602
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,346
It's all going to happen
on the Christmas date?

603
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,015
It's Christmas!

604
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:46,186
I don't know.
I have a lot of worries, too.

605
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,478
I don't know.

606
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,107
I'm scared our relationship will change.

607
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,693
I'm a little scared.

608
00:35:53,985 --> 00:36:00,158
But what will you do
if Yuya asks you to go steady tomorrow?

609
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,745
-He won't.
-Why?

610
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,372
He won't.

611
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,917
He won't.
