1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:18,561
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,228
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,607
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,484
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:30,906
Tonight, Ken will be absent
due to a film shoot.

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,826
Saito is very passionate
about Terrace House.

8
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,287
-I get really into it.
-Yes, he does.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,540
Being here really brings it out.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,917
Oh, shut up.

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,213
Wow, it's blue inside. How stylish!

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,506
-Torichan...
-It's so stylish.

13
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,634
Did you not watch our bit?

14
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,636
-Last week...
-Yes.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,932
-Let's see... Oh, Lauren and Taishi...
-Lauren and Taishi...

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,601
Lauren unexpectedly...

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,644
-She was cut down.
-Yes.

18
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,895
That's right.

19
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,523
-I'll put the piece up in LA.
-Thank you! That makes me happy.

20
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,736
I'll show off saying,
"My friend drew this."

21
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,446
-Nice.
-I'm glad.

22
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,325
-There wasn't a chance for her to talk.
-No, Taishi didn't let her...

23
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,537
-Taishi referred to her as a friend.
-He did.

24
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:22,625
-That was a little...
-He put up a wall.

25
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,085
And Lauren went to Japan.

26
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,797
Then Anna and Yuya went to lunch.

27
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,009
There's going to be a conflict.

28
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,845
What are your plans with her?

29
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,180
I haven't really thought about it.

30
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,933
I'll feel better when things are clear.

31
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,685
Why does it matter to you so much?

32
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:46,356
-It feels kind of unsettled otherwise.
-It doesn't.

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,440
On my end.

34
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,986
Anna is sticking her nose
in Avian and Yuya's business.

35
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,322
She's questioning their relationship.

36
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,910
Anna went on a horseback riding date
with Taishi.

37
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,746
-I'm starting to remember.
-Yes, Taishi...

38
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,958
-Taishi likes Anna.
-He loves her.

39
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,045
The date seemed really fun.
She even made a bento lunch.

40
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,632
He gave her an apron
to make the meal and everything.

41
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,885
-But...
-It seemed like things were going well.

42
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,306
I don't really feel that way about Taishi.

43
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,724
He's not your type?

44
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,518
I don't think he's my type.

45
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,064
Anna said she doesn't see him that way
and that he's not her type.

46
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,399
You've got to be kidding me.

47
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,276
Who the hell does she think she is?

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,988
-Well...
-It can't be helped.

49
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:35,948
It can't?

50
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,576
No. People don't fall in love that easily.

51
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,704
That's why when it happens, it's splendid.

52
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,207
You're so right, Saito.

53
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,210
We have no right to judge her.

54
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:53,631
-And then Lauren...
-Yes, she went to Japan.

55
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,884
-She reunited with Naomi.
-That's right.

56
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,346
I thought about asking him,

57
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,099
but Taishi is interested in Anna.

58
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,558
-I see.
-So, I think...

59
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,268
-I'm okay.
-You're okay?

60
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,813
-I'm okay. I...
-You won't regret it?

61
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,608
I think I'll be able to discover
my new self here in Tokyo.

62
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,068
In a whole new environment.

63
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,864
I think it's time to move on
to the next chapter in my life.

64
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,200
She said she'll be starting a new life
in Tokyo.

65
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,535
So she'll move to Japan.

66
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:27,249
She'll go back to tell everyone,
and then go to Japan.

67
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,794
I can't imagine
what will happen this week.

68
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,629
Right? Let's watch.

69
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,716
Things tend to happen
when people decide to leave.

70
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,474
OMOTESANDO, TOKYO

71
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,893
When will you be back?

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,939
Around the 21st.

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,026
You're here for work this time?

74
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,738
For work this time and to stay a week

75
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,992
to see what it'll be like...

76
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,995
So you'll be back in Tokyo again?

77
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,415
Next time, I'll be moving here.

78
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:13,003
So you won't go back and forth?

79
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,379
I want Japan as my base.

80
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,925
I see. So it's flipped now,
and this will be your home base.

81
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,847
I really want to start a new life.

82
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:32,564
ELLE GIRL ONLINE SHOOT

83
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,070
Looks good.

84
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,877
-You got really sunburned, Guy.
-That's what Yuya said.

85
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,420
I thought that right away.

86
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,215
-He's red.
-Yeah, Guy got dark.

87
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,843
-I want to see Guy surf.
-Yeah.

88
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,260
-Me, too.
-When?

89
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,055
-The waves will be huge tomorrow.
-No way!

90
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,140
-We have to go.
-Let's go.

91
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,767
-I've got school.
-You do, right?

92
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,770
-Too bad, Yuya.
-Yeah, too bad.

93
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,191
-You're all going?
-I'm so excited. Seriously.

94
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,694
-It's 10:30 already.
-Yeah.

95
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,613
I'll be going then.

96
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,782
-Going to sleep?
-I'm going downstairs.

97
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,202
Me, too. Let's go together.

98
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,454
What are you going to do downstairs?

99
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,082
-Work...
-Don't ask that.

100
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,460
-See you.
-Work hard.

101
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,796
What are you doing tomorrow?

102
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,134
I have hula in the morning.

103
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,137
Like... like that?

104
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,724
-Was that offensive?
-Yeah, a little bit.

105
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,853
-We should make hamburgers.
-Sounds nice.

106
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,356
We can make a bento lunch for Guy.

107
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,193
-To eat when Guy's surfing? Nice.
-Yes, we can go watch him.

108
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,820
I'll be cooking, too, not just Anna.

109
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,572
Gross.

110
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,824
What does that mean?

111
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,328
FUNABASHI, CHIBA

112
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,449
This coffee table...

113
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,910
and this shelf unit.

114
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,956
-For today?
-I want to buy those today.

115
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,040
-For today?
-Yes.

116
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,625
Got it. Let's see...

117
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,339
I'll give you a list of your choices,

118
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,592
and once you're set, we can finalize

119
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,304
-and work out delivery.
-Yes, thank you.

120
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,937
The apron looks great on you.

121
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,771
-Does it?
-It does.

122
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,190
I love it. Thank you.

123
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,734
-I always wear it.
-I have great taste.

124
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,863
So, you're in charge of chopping.

125
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,450
-Like this?
-Yeah, as long as it's minced.

126
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,494
Wow.

127
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,955
No compliments, please.
I'll cut my finger.

128
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,957
I've done that before a lot.

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,541
You're much better than me.

130
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,627
Just chopping.

131
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,837
Amazing.

132
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,632
I used to do the prep all the time.

133
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,302
You're seriously very good at that.

134
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,597
It's just chopping.
I used to chop five kilograms every day.

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,682
-Really?
-It was part of prep work.

136
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,895
Sounds tough.

137
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,563
Nice.

138
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,691
You're the type of girl who can cook.

139
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,278
-Am I?
-Yeah, you cook pretty well.

140
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,362
No way!

141
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,240
-You've gained points, seriously.
-Really?

142
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,784
So, Avian...

143
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,912
-was saying she wanted to make cheesecake.
-Really?

144
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,042
-For Yuya's birthday.
-Nice.

145
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,670
-It's almost ready.
-Hey, hope I'm not interrupting.

146
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,214
-Go ahead.
-What'd you do today?

147
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,884
I did some job hunting
and then went to the gym...

148
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,012
and was on the computer.

149
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,014
-You've gotten bigger.
-Have I?

150
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,017
-Right?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

151
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,352
-A little macho.
-I'm working on it.

152
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,813
-You've gotten so much bigger!
-I'm working hard.

153
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,690
Yes, you have been.

154
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,194
-Let's eat.
-Looks good.

155
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,112
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

156
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,448
Someone's home.

157
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
What great timing.

158
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,077
-Guy?
-Guy!

159
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,495
-Welcome back.
-Guess he can have some.

160
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,540
-Want a hamburger?
-Oh, a new board.

161
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,084
Do you want a hamburger?

162
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,793
Hey.

163
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,920
One more time.

164
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,215
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

165
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,632
It looks so good.

166
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,804
-Is it good?
-It's so good.

167
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,140
It's cooked through.

168
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,226
-This'll be in your lunch tomorrow.
-Wild.

169
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,352
That's right.

170
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,396
-I'm getting really focused.
-You are?

171
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,065
-You are?
-I am.

172
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,608
-No way.
-Why?

173
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,651
-I'm scared.
-Scared?

174
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,448
You do seem different than usual.

175
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,826
You're not laughing as much today.

176
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,454
Wow, that's impressive.

177
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,540
It's life or death if you wipe out, right?

178
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,168
-Wow.
-It's crazy when you think about it.

179
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,838
People would normally be too scared.

180
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,884
If you wipe out on this,
you'd get hurt, right?

181
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,428
Let me see.

182
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,723
-Will it be like this tomorrow?
-Yeah, like that.

183
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,807
That's insane.

184
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,352
-He's really on it.
-Looks like Waikiki.

185
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,646
No, it's Waimea.

186
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,856
-That's Waimea?
-It gets like this in Waimea?

187
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,608
-You can tell?
-How can you tell?

188
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,403
-The waves are different.
-You can tell from the wave?

189
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,612
Impressive.

190
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,988
Like the color's different?

191
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,698
-The wave is different.
-The wave?

192
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,952
You're a different person
when you talk about surfing.

193
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,373
-You're not the usual goofy Guy.
-Seriously.

194
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,125
You're not goofing around at all.

195
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,128
-It's amazing.
-He has his game face on now.

202
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,526
We're eating shrimp.

203
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,239
How are the waves?

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,575
-They're slowly getting there.
-Are they?

205
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,659
Are you nervous?

206
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,413
No, since they're still growing,

207
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:49,501
they may or may not get bigger
in the evening.

208
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,670
-So you don't know yet.
-But it'll get there.

209
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,048
Over there is the famous Banzai Pipeline.

210
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,969
Right. This area is for advanced surfers.

211
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,679
That's the pipeline.

212
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:07,352
-That's where it is.
-That looks insane. That's insane!

213
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,103
Wow, that's insane.

214
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,356
Isn't that insane?

215
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,691
-It's just getting started.
-It is?

216
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,151
-It's just starting.
-Really?

217
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,861
They're riding it!

218
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,241
-It looks so fun. I wish I could go.
-I'm going to go in.

219
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,578
-Are you leaving this?
-I want to go watch up front.

220
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,921
You guys are loud.

221
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,214
-We're too loud.
-We're being rowdy.

222
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,762
-He's riding it!
-He is!

223
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,724
-Amazing. Guy's on the wave.
-Wow!

224
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,936
That's insane. He's so cool.

225
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,397
-He's so cool.
-That's just insane.

226
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,149
There he is, Guy!

227
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,026
-Is that him?
-That's Guy.

228
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,612
He's so cool.

229
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,241
He's too cool.

230
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,329
He's so cool.

231
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,539
-Go!
-He's going.

232
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,916
Insane!

233
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,422
-Wow.
-He's amazing.

234
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,549
That looks so fun!

235
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,766
Wow, there are so many people here.

236
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,895
Amazing.

237
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,523
-The waves are getting bigger.
-Wow.

238
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,150
It's huge!

239
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,532
-Is that Guy?
-That's Guy. That's Guy!

240
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,325
-It is.
-No way!

241
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,370
Wow!

242
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,122
He's amazing.

243
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,137
-The wave's huge! It's huge!
-Wow!

244
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,848
-This one's huge.
-Insane!

245
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,893
Isn't it insane?

246
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,312
It's big, it's really huge.

247
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,733
Amazing.

248
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,195
This is what everyone was waiting for.

249
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,323
-It's so different from before.
-Totally different.

250
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,119
-It's amazing.
-It is.

251
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,628
Guy was great today.

252
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,630
Did you take a video?

253
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,215
-Well...
-You didn't?

254
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,343
He was a little too far.

255
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,305
-You couldn't see?
-I wanted to see.

256
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,267
It's amazing for him to be able to
ride a wave that big.

257
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,061
What time is he coming home?

258
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,606
We didn't get to ask.

259
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,192
We left before him.

260
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,528
-You didn't wait for him to come out?
-No.

261
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,782
We decided to leave when the sun set.

262
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,201
I think he was still there.

263
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,243
Where's Guy?

264
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,163
-He's not home yet.
-I wonder if he's on the way?

265
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,749
Probably.

266
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,876
-Hey, Yuya.
-Hey.

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,422
I wonder when he's coming back.
It's the tournament tomorrow, right?

268
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,674
I'm sure. I don't know, but...

269
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,596
-What?
-Are you okay, Guy? What happened?

270
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,222
-Guy...
-What happened?

271
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,891
-What?
-This is a surprise.

272
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,186
-You all right?
-What happened?

273
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,355
-I ate it.
-Seriously?

274
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,523
Are you okay?

275
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,275
Seriously?

276
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,236
-I ate it.
-You're serious.

277
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,320
Are you okay?

278
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,616
-When?
-Seriously, Guy?

279
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,784
-Are you okay?
-Was it your board?

280
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,077
Are you okay?

281
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,664
-When did you guys leave?
-You should sit.

282
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,501
Right around when the sun set.

283
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,337
So after you left, there was a big wave.

284
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,340
Are you okay?

285
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:10,344
The wave came at me
and hit me in the neck.

286
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,682
Then my face slammed into the reef.

287
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,811
And... I'm not really sure...

288
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,063
I got really scared for a moment.

289
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,940
It was really scary.

290
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,860
Did you go to the hospital?

291
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,738
-I went and got a CT scan.
-Really?

292
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,032
You were allowed to go home?

293
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,450
Yeah, they said I could go home.

294
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,369
-Seriously?
-Are you okay?

295
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,288
It all happened so quickly.

296
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,918
The moment I went under, I hit the ground.

297
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,881
I got disoriented when I was underwater.

298
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,510
It felt like I was
on the verge of blacking out.

299
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,055
-Seriously?
-My teeth hurt like crazy.

300
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,558
-Seriously?
-It looks rough.

301
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,768
Your face is really swollen.

302
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:04,190
-Your face hurts?
-It does. The wave went into my neck.

303
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:08,528
I heard the sound of my neck twisting.

304
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,363
-You got whiplash.
-Then I hit the ground.

305
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,283
I don't even know why my back hurts.

306
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,788
I know why my neck hurts.
I felt it twist the moment the wave hit.

307
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,585
-Is this the first time you...
-Yeah, my first time.

308
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,669
Really?

309
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,591
It's scary. I was scared. I came out...

310
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,761
and I cried.

311
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,472
-I was so scared.
-You could have died.

312
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,933
My body was shaking.

313
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,519
If I had lost consciousness...

314
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,105
It was dark, so...

315
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,941
I probably would have died.

316
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,401
That thought made me really scared.

317
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,699
What did the doctor say?
That you should rest?

318
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:59,704
He said to see how things go,

319
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,249
and if I have any problems,
I should contact him.

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,377
You might be in more pain later.

321
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,423
I was just scared.
After it happened, all I felt was fear.

322
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,926
I'll open that.

323
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,846
-Can you take a sip?
-I don't know.

324
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,599
-I wonder if we have a straw.
-We have a straw.

325
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,769
I remember seeing a straw.

326
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,188
Thanks.

327
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,693
It looks painful.

328
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,863
It hurts.

329
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,784
-Avian.
-Avian.

330
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,076
-What?
-Guy got hurt.

331
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,541
You can't just say "Yo."

332
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,044
Are you okay, Guy?

333
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,545
Of course not.

334
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,340
-How did I look though?
-You looked really cool.

335
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:58,137
Each wave is so powerful there.

336
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,723
And there's always a risk, but...

337
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,060
Surfing with all the pros,

338
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,772
I think I waited an hour
for the first wave,

339
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,107
and I was able to ride one.

340
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,568
That's how it is there.

341
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,405
So it takes time and focus
for just one wave.

342
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,660
I need to charge my phone.

343
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,204
-I'll do it.
-I have a tournament tomorrow.

344
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,290
-You can't surf in your condition.
-You shouldn't.

345
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,877
-I need to cancel.
-I can grab it from downstairs.

346
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,879
Should I grab the laptop?

347
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,966
I'll grab the laptop and charger.

348
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,096
-Guy, here.
-Avian.

349
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,140
-Here's ice.
-You should keep it cool.

350
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,018
Thanks. Where should I put it?

351
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,561
Here.

352
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,313
Just a little...

353
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,232
Can you send a cancellation email?

354
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,654
She types so fast.

355
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,163
Thank you.

356
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,085
Thank you, guys, for coming today.

357
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,714
I was genuinely really happy

358
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,591
that you guys came out,

359
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,595
that you wanted to know what it's like.

360
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,515
I'm happy you understand.

361
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,143
It was amazing.

362
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:32,189
I've been wanting to go for awhile.
I finally got to see you surf.

363
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,610
-We didn't expect this to happen.
-Right?

364
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,363
I guess things like that happen.
It's scary.

365
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,159
When the waves are that big,

366
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
you can seriously hurt yourself.

367
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,997
The way he described it was scary.

368
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,707
The way he heard it
when the wave hit his neck.

369
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,126
He said it twisted his neck.

370
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,879
So it came down on top of him.

371
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,214
-It's crazy.
-It's scary.

372
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,092
He said he could've died.

373
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,552
I'm glad he's okay.

374
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,806
He wasn't exaggerating.
I'm sure he really felt that way.

375
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,558
He said that his teeth hurt, too.

376
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,645
He hit the ground as well, so...

377
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,816
I'm sure he hit his teeth.

378
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,692
Where is the reef?

379
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,779
The reef is where the coral is clustered.

380
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,363
Yes, there.

381
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,907
Wow, he hit that?

382
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,033
That hard area.

383
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,954
-It hurts just to walk on that.
-That's right.

384
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,123
-That's right.
-That's true.

385
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,668
He looked really cool though,
when he was riding the wave.

386
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:40,341
He was. But while he was on the verge
of death, Lauren was shopping at IKEA.

387
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,804
The way you said that. That wasn't nice.

388
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,598
"I want this shelf." That's what she said.

389
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,644
Lauren is preparing to do her own thing.

390
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:58,775
Everyone mentioned this,
but when Guy was riding those waves,

391
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,196
the way Anna was reacting...

392
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,656
Is that just a, "Wow, he's so cool"?

393
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,451
Just like us while we watched.

394
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,996
Like, "Wow, amazing!"

395
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,332
Can women fall for someone
in those moments?

396
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,918
-Totally.
-Yes, of course.

397
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,337
I mean, Anna doesn't like anyone yet.

398
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,923
But for Taishi,

399
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,217
he's like,
"Let's make hamburgers together.

400
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,928
The apron looks good on you."

401
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,763
He's got that vibe.

402
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,600
He's ready to go out with her any time.
But it's a one-way street.

403
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,228
It's hard for a man to tell.

404
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,147
I'd think she was into me.

405
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,525
Me, too. If she acted like that,
I'd think I could go for it.

406
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,486
But what about when you
see how cool Guy is?

407
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,697
-Like how Taishi sees Guy?
-Yes, you mentioned that.

408
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,783
They're not rivals or anything,

409
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,955
but when your guy friend is showing off
how cool he is,

410
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,042
it's fine
because you're into different things.

411
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,084
But it gets to you.

412
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:01,588
So the best thing a guy can do
is to be even more supportive

413
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,051
and show how you're okay with it.

414
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,802
It's a defense mechanism.

415
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,721
So that's why he kept saying
how cool Guy was?

416
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,809
-It's a defense mechanism?
-He was yelling the loudest.

417
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,937
Wasn't it because
the waves were amazing?

418
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,898
Yes, but if you say it the loudest,
louder than the women,

419
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,445
-you protect yourself.
-These two understand.

420
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,948
-They really get it.
-They've got experience.

421
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,699
-It's not on purpose.
-I see.

422
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,243
If it were me, I'd say,
"Let's go home."

423
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,497
You're showing your petty side.

424
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,263
It's so romantic.

425
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,733
This is amazing.

426
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,237
-I've never been here.
-This is Sky.

427
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,530
It's beautiful.

428
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,408
Thanks for bringing me here today.

429
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,537
You seem different today.

430
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,416
What? What?

431
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,044
You seem different today.

432
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,714
I've never worn a dress
in front of you before.

433
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,592
You should wear dresses more often.

434
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,927
More often? Like every day?

435
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,555
-Not every day.
-You'd get bored of it.

436
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,183
-I guess it's nice because it's rare.
-That's right.

437
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,185
It's so good.

438
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,730
It is? I'm glad.

439
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,358
I'm glad you like it.

440
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,737
I'll remember this.

441
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,615
I'll always remember this.

442
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,784
The day isn't over yet.

443
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,453
I have a gift for you.

444
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,791
Now?

445
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,210
-All of a sudden? Thanks.
-A gift for you.

446
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,923
Open it.

447
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,717
It says "happy birthday" on it.

448
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,804
What do you think it is? Can you tell?

449
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,097
Sunglasses?

450
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,767
All your sunglasses are broken.

451
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,353
You don't own any good ones.

452
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,230
-Try them on.
-I'm so happy.

453
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:27,276
Try them.
They'll be even better in the sun.

454
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,778
They look great on you.

455
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,322
-They do?
-Yes, they do.

456
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,699
-They do?
-They're totally your style.

457
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,869
I'm glad. You didn't have a white pair.

458
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,166
When Yuya gets back.

459
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,044
-When Yuya enters the room?
-Yeah.

460
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,045
-When he comes in.
-Okay.

461
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,632
It's so cute.

462
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,264
We're back.

463
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,019
How disappointing.

464
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,021
-Welcome back!
-The poppers weren't that good.

465
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:08,024
Wow, this is so cute.

466
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,402
-Wow, nice.
-It's really cute.

467
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,844
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday!

468
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,514
Happy birthday!

469
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,848
Thanks.

470
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,600
-Happy 19th birthday!
-Thanks.

471
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,770
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

472
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,234
Is it good?

473
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,237
-Is it good? Can I have some?
-It's so good.

474
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,907
-You're a good baker.
-It's really good.

475
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,161
I think it came out good myself.

476
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:04,456
-It's really good.
-Why is your strawberry so big?

477
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,000
I took the one on top. Do you want it?

478
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,961
I can't take that from you!

479
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,963
You know you want it.

480
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,216
-You can have it.
-I'm not going to take it.

481
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,718
That's so cute.

482
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,265
-The swelling has gone down.
-Yeah, it's gotten better.

483
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,474
I'm all better.

484
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,601
That was really quick.

485
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,104
I'm actually going back to Japan
for a checkup.

486
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:31,317
-It's decided?
-I have tickets for the 22nd.

487
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,194
-The day after tomorrow?
-It's decided?

488
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,071
-Really?
-When are you coming back?

489
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,281
In a week.

490
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:41,993
They're going to check my teeth
and do a checkup.

491
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,039
-That's a good idea.
-You should go get checked out.

492
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,210
Just from other surfers'
past experiences...

493
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,252
Just in case.

494
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,298
Avian, do you want
to say something to Yuya?

495
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,262
-Avian...
-I love stuff like this.

496
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,808
To us.

497
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,733
I totally thought
he was going to kiss her!

498
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,193
I thought he was going to kiss her.

499
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,154
We were waiting for it.

500
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,369
Yuya, are you sure?
Do you want to try again?

501
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,371
Again?

502
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,337
Well, I...

503
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,343
-She's luring me in.
-She's totally asking for it.

504
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,221
-Oh, Yuya.
-Be a man!

505
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,805
-Really?
-She tempted me.

506
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,696
Nice. I'm getting warm.

507
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,032
-Me, too.
-It's so hot! It's hot!

508
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,369
I'm the one who's hot.

509
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,164
-Maybe we should leave.
-True.

510
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,123
It's okay.

511
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,378
-It's your birthday.
-Your birthday night...

512
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,880
-The two of you should...
-Really?

513
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,555
So...

514
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,766
I was wondering what we should do.

515
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,269
What we should do?

516
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,397
About our relationship.

517
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,446
I wanted to talk about it a little.

518
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,074
It's difficult to decide.

519
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,786
Because...

520
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,748
when I go back to Japan...

521
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,084
We're together all the time,

522
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,588
but suddenly,
we won't see each other at all.

523
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,342
We won't hear each other's voices.

524
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,303
I'm worried whether or not...

525
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,930
we can make it work.

526
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,601
-Long distance?
-Yeah.

527
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,313
My previous long-distance relationship
didn't work out.

528
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,859
I want us to be in a relationship.

529
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,489
Right now?

530
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,991
Yeah. I want to be with you.

531
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:30,537
You'd be okay
with a long-distance relationship?

532
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,712
It didn't work out for me before.

533
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:46,678
I've never seen long-distance work before.
I don't know.

534
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,972
I can't see how it would work.

535
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,612
I'll give you some time to think about it.

536
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,293
Hey. I'm home.

537
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,586
Welcome back!

538
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,588
She's got a lot of stuff.

539
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,842
-Oh, wow.
-Insane.

540
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,344
How did you bring that home?

541
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,932
-Thank you, thank you.
-I got it.

542
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,893
Isn't it raining? Oh, this is light.

543
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,687
-Are you okay?
-It's lighter now.

544
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,272
It looks cold outside.

545
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:43,819
-I'm sorry. I caught a cold.
-You did?

546
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,779
-I caught a cold.
-Where should I...

547
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,741
It's been a while.

548
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,786
-Is Guy surfing?
-He's sleeping.

549
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,539
He can't surf right now. He got hurt.

550
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,208
-It was bad.
-Really?

551
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,836
He got hurt on the pipeline.

552
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,172
-His face?
-He hit his face.

553
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,425
Is Anna at work?

554
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,594
-She's at work.
-I see.

555
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,345
-She's working late today.
-Really?

556
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,348
Oh, I went horseback riding with Anna.

557
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,808
-How was it?
-It was so fun.

558
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,810
-It was?
-Look at the pictures.

559
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,063
-The scenery is beautiful. Nice.
-It was beautiful.

560
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,232
Horses.

561
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,401
-Doesn't it look fun?
-It does.

562
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,404
That's all.

563
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,075
-Nice.
-It was fun.

564
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,159
I'm glad.

565
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,290
-How was the date?
-It was good.

566
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,793
-Any outcome?
-Outcome?

567
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,838
Outcome? I'm not sure.
I've been wondering.

568
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,800
I had fun and want to hang out
with her more.

569
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:53,722
But I'm not sure.
We did talk about getting drinks.

570
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,684
-Drinking might help.
-Yeah.

571
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:02,397
-You'd be more relaxed.
-I want to talk to her more.

572
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,693
Yeah...

573
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,905
The 19-year-old Yuya.

574
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,824
There's no difference between 18 and 19.

575
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,327
-It's the last year of your teens.
-It's almost your turn, Lauren.

576
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,621
In three weeks.

577
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,874
-What's going to happen?
-I wonder.

578
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,419
That was quite dramatic.

579
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,923
Avian said she wants to be with Yuya.

580
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,635
She couldn't do it anymore.
She said she wants to be with him.

581
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,680
-She said it twice.
-She did.

582
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,350
He doesn't seem to know what to do.

583
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,062
I think maybe Yuya isn't that into her.

584
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:46,357
To kiss her in that first moment
would've been a statement.

585
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,193
-That they're together?
-Yes.

586
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,112
I feel like that reflected
his lack of confidence.

587
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,073
-There's a bit of that.
-A little.

588
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,827
-Avian was definitely expecting it.
-Yes.

589
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,665
If he kissed her then,
he'd have to sign a marriage license.

590
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,291
-That far?
-But he's not ready.

591
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,627
-It would've been official.
-Would it?

592
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,964
The whole long-distance thing
sounded like an excuse.

593
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,090
Right.

594
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,677
It wasn't like he was really traumatized,

595
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,805
and he doesn't want to hurt her, was it?

596
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,016
It was just, "Well, it didn't
work out in the past, so..."

597
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,895
Yes, how are we supposed
to respond to that?

598
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,647
That's true.

599
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,441
After what he said,
their relationship can't go anywhere.

600
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,402
But for Avian...

601
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,698
he should take off that hat...

602
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,325
That really flashy one with sparkles.

603
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,078
It did take away from the moment.

604
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,875
When you give men time to think...

605
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,877
don't they really take their time?

606
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,254
Like, how long are you going to take?

607
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,297
She's mad.

608
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,634
-That's probably true.
-Definitely.

609
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,678
-Especially someone like Yuya.
-Definitely.

610
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,598
-It seems like he's going to run.
-It does.

611
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,602
There was a time we all thought
he didn't have feelings for her at all.

612
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,688
He was just embarrassed then,
but is it different this time?

613
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:10,692
-That's true. That happened before.
-It did.

614
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:15,321
He could have been truly traumatized
from a past experience.

615
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,784
-He's always confusing us.
-That's right.

616
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,745
-I wonder which it is.
-Avian won't wait that long, though.

617
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:26,249
I'm sure she'll ask him again next week.
"So, what are you going to do?"

618
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,836
And he'll say, "I can't do it. I'm sorry."

619
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,838
-Then it would just end.
-Yes, it would.

620
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,465
I want to hear, "Then why did you kiss me?

621
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,929
-Then why did you kiss me?"
-"Why?"

622
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,140
-We want to hear that.
-Yeah.

623
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,768
I'd definitely take the sunglasses back.

624
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:49,064
That's true.
All of her gifts have been expensive.

625
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,774
It's not cost-effective.

626
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,196
-You're leaving for Japan today?
-Yeah, today.

627
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,155
For how long?

628
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,783
About a week.

629
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,244
When is your checkup?

630
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:07,373
The checkup is the day after,
and the dentist the day after that.

631
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:08,917
Um...

632
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,464
-What?
-Taishi and Anna aren't here right now.

633
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,884
That can't be helped, but...

634
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,181
What's wrong?

635
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,725
It's nothing.

636
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,229
I'm going to leave Terrace House.

637
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,998
If I move to Tokyo,

638
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,626
I'll have new experiences.

639
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:56,589
I feel like I'll be able to discover
a new me.

640
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,303
So I'm going to move to Tokyo.

641
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:08,226
So you were really preparing to move
while you were in Japan.

642
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,812
After going over there...

643
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,399
I feel really motivated.

644
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,650
When are you leaving?

645
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:19,445
I haven't decided on a date yet,
but probably this week.

646
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,823
-This week?
-This week.

647
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,867
You said we'd go hiking.

648
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,829
-We can go on a walk in Tokyo.
-A hike in Tokyo?

649
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,372
A walk in Tokyo.

650
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,498
Yeah.

651
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,044
I experienced a lot here.

652
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:39,007
I got to know everyone,
and I was able to open an exhibit.

653
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,177
I didn't get to experience romance.

654
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,140
Avian and everyone...

655
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,269
So much happened.

656
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,896
It makes me sad.

657
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,564
It was three months, right?

658
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,191
Four months.

659
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:03,990
It was amazing.
I won't ever forget this house.
