1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,222
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:18,644
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,353
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,523
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,234
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,778
Let's see. Last week...

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,489
Taishi has been vocal
about his interest in Anna.

8
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,866
Yes, he has.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,329
Well, I felt more with Anna.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,374
I think she is the most similar
to the type of girls I have dated.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,295
And Anna tells Taishi
she wants to talk to him.

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,591
-In front of everyone.
-Yes, so they can talk alone.

13
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,719
Thanks for bringing this.
Will you take it back?

14
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,679
-Sure.
-Thanks.

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,431
-I've got the coffee.
-Are you okay? Need a hug?

16
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,146
-Hugs are important.
-Thank you.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,650
-The hug seemed even more like--
-That's right.

18
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,819
...if something's going to happen,
just let it.

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,487
The hug was like an attack.

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,447
Yes, now that we know where he stands.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,578
But I noticed that
when Taishi and Anna were talking,

22
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,374
there was a shot of an iconic
facial expression we've all seen before.

23
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,376
There may be some meaning behind it.

24
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,172
-And Eric finally completed his pop-up.
-Eric left.

25
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,966
-And...
-And...

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,425
We have a new member.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,804
-He came.
-Yes, Guy, who all the ladies like.

28
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,556
-Yes, they say he's cute.
-He is cute.

29
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,560
A pro surfer from Shonan.
Guy Sato, 20 years old.

30
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,437
How long have you surfed?

31
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,357
It's been 15 years already.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,861
-Fifteen years?
-I've surfed since I was five.

33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,947
Do you plan to surf here?

34
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,574
Yes, I plan to attack the big wave.

35
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,328
-The pipeline?
-How cool!

36
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,874
-My sponsor's house is right in front.
-Oh, Volcom!

37
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,752
-Volcom house!
-Oh, Volcom.

38
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,630
When did you start competing?

39
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,464
When I was about seven or eight.

40
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:18,305
His relaxed demeanor is cute
because he is a pro.

41
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,348
-Having that foundation is important.
-It is.

42
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,852
You're more persuasive
when you have a solid foundation.

43
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,354
And... Oh, that's right...

44
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,274
-Yuya and Avian.
-That was painful.

45
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,609
What? It was nice.

46
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:35,030
We found out that Yuya was cold to Avian

47
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,158
because he was embarrassed about
his true feelings for her.

48
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,953
He really likes her.

49
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,705
But I was embarrassed.

50
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,541
I was cold to her out of embarrassment.

51
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,625
I know what you mean.

52
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,215
But it's already Christmas.
I'm hoping to tell her how I feel now.

53
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,884
-But he gets embarrassed easily.
-Yuya?

54
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,012
His words can be harsh,
but he's just hiding his embarrassment.

55
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,098
He's sweet.

56
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:06,103
But what will you do
if Yuya asks you to go steady tomorrow?

57
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,396
-He won't.
-Why?

58
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,899
He won't.

59
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:16,654
For some reason,
Avian doesn't think he'll say anything.

60
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,533
Because she knows Yuya so well,

61
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:25,122
she thinks he'll be too embarrassed
to say anything on Christmas.

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,417
-She knows him well.
-She really understands him.

63
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,295
-Only Avian would understand.
-Right?

64
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,339
That he was just embarrassed.

65
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,550
Naomi must be watching Netflix
saying, "What?

66
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,138
What? With that attitude?

67
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,058
That's ridiculous! I've left already!"

68
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,521
-We'll see the date and maybe Guy surfing.
-I want to see that!

69
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,856
The skills of a pro.

70
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,483
But Guy...

71
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:59,281
With Taishi saying he's interested in Anna

72
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,909
and Yuya and Avian getting together...

73
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:06,246
"Lauren, let's eat rice balls."

74
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,041
I don't know if he'll be able to ask her.

75
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,460
You're treating him
like he's Winnie-the-Pooh!

76
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,714
-"I want some honey."
-"I want to eat some honey."

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,428
He's starting to look like him!

78
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,181
-We'll get to see Christmas Guy.
-Yes, Christmas Guy.

79
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,724
-I want to see that!
-Me, too!

80
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,726
I want to see all the versions of Guy!

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,638
-Guy!
-Tai!

82
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,352

Keys?

88
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,759
I guess we don't have to lock it.

89
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,684
-What about the keys?
-They're in the car.

90
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,770
-Thank you.
-Go ahead.

91
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,693
Off we go!

92
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,736
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

93
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,643
-Etiquette is important.
-Now I'm ready to kiss someone.

94
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,568
-You are.
-I can kiss someone now.

95
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,534
Wow. They have places like this in Hawaii?

96
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:36,664
-I feel like I'm in Disneyland.
-It's totally different.

97
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,166
I think I'm gonna fall.

98
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,296
-You're nervous, aren't you?
-I'm going to fall. I don't want to fall.

99
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,548
It's okay if you fall.

100
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,550
-Would it be embarrassing?
-It would.

101
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,596
-It would be embarrassing.
-It would.

102
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,895
This is embarrassing.

103
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,152
Why?

104
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,195
I don't know.

105
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,245
You are shy!

106
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,997
Your face is so red!

107
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,126
-Your face is red.
-Is it red?

108
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,960
-You're nervous, aren't you?
-I am.

109
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,462
Nice. That's cute.

110
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,464
No!

111
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,135
Why?

112
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,222
This is so embarrassing.

113
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,599
It's fine.

114
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,585
Come sit here.

115
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,587
I'll sit there.

116
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,297
Thank you.

117
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,553
Thanks for inviting me today.

118
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:19,642
It's not often I get to spend Christmas
on a date with someone I like.

119
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,018
It's really nice.

120
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,065
-I was really worried.
-Why?

121
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,693
I was worried you liked someone else.

122
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,866
You don't have to worry about that.
My feelings won't change.

123
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,452
I couldn't have known that.

124
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,787
Anna may have arrived,

125
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,250
but I like you. That hasn't changed.

126
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,586
It still hasn't changed.

127
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,090
-I was worried, though.
-It was the same for me.

128
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,884
-Really?
-I was really worried.

129
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,515
I like you.

130
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,148
This is embarrassing.

131
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,899
Want some bread?

132
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,113
-Want some more bread?
-I'll have some more.

133
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,657
I like you.

134
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,077
I can't handle someone saying that
to my face.

135
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:24,040
But me, too. Thank you.
That makes me happy.

136
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,296
-Why are you embarrassed?
-It's embarrassing.

137
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,300
The fact that I like you won't change.

138
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,927
I've liked you from the start.
That hasn't changed.

139
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,388
And it won't change.

140
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,891
Okay.

141
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,145
Why are you telling me this?

142
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,021
I realized I haven't told you.

143
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,441
Yeah.

144
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:55,112
It makes me really happy
that you're telling me how you feel.

145
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,536
There were times when I was like...

146
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,206
"Why is he acting like this?"

147
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,417
-But I wasn't sure if I should ask.
-I was just embarrassed.

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,586
That's what I thought.

149
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,923
It wasn't how I really felt.

150
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,509
Thank you for telling me.

I'll toast the pizza tomorrow
for breakfast.

160
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,198
-Do you mind if I use the restroom?
-Go ahead.

161
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,223
Not yet.

162
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,520
-They haven't brought it.
-I struggled to find the restroom.

163

we'd exchange Christmas presents?

165
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,986
I brought your present today.

166
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,154
Seriously?

167
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,325
Open it. Here.

168
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,117
Thank you.

169
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,080

-Open it.

171

What is it?

172
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,965
A jacket?

173
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,969

00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,349
-Yeah.
-It's Kanye's?

176
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,560
-It's from Kanye's concert.
-No way!

177
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,194
Thank you.

178
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,780
Oh, wait.

179
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,499
Wait, is it not in there?

180
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,002
It's there? Good.

181
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,671
And shoes, for you.

182
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,382
I can get a pair with this?

183
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,553
Yeah, of course. It's a gift certificate.

184
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,889
Wow, I'll go buy some.

185
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,935
-You didn't forget, did you?
-What?

186
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,606
Did you forget my present?

187
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,984
-You didn't get me a gift, did you?
-I only got the Secret Santa gift.

188
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,111
I knew it!

189
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,447
You're horrible!

190
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,866
-You forgot?
-It's not that I forgot.

191
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,118
Right?

192
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,623
Do you remember?

193
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,421
-You don't remember?
-When did we talk about it?

194
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,506
We said we'd exchange gifts.

195
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,757
No, we didn't.

196
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,342
-You don't remember?
-We didn't.

197
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,513
-When did we talk about it?
-When we went surfing.

198
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,641
You don't remember.

199
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,894
It's fine, but...

200
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,315
-You look so disappointed.
-Thanks for dinner.

201
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,360
You're so disappointed.
Why did it have to end like this?

202
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,988
It's okay. Let's go.

203
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,584
This way.

204
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,010
-Which is it? Did he really forget?
-He's done it now!

205
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,430
-I don't think so.
-It seems like...

206
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,434
Maybe he'll give it to her later,
when they're looking at the city lights.

207
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,977
He totally forgot.

208
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,312
-I don't think so.
-I think he really forgot.

209
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,189
There's still the car ride home.

210
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,358
-No, I think he forgot.
-Right, Torichan?

211
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,569
-You think so?
-Seriously?

212
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:50,241
The Secret Santa he mentioned
is a gift exchange with everyone.

213
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,035
-Oh! So that's what...
-What?

214
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,080
She said, "That's all you remembered?"

215
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,791
He only remembered
the gift exchange with everyone.

216
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,710
Yes, he only bought the gift for that.

217
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,796
So the gift exchange
between the two of them...

218
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,383
-He didn't get her a gift.
-He forgot about that.

219
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,887
-I think he has a gift for her.
-He definitely doesn't.

220
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,390
I want to bet on him having one.
I want to believe that.

221
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,309
-He definitely has one.
-Oh, this is...

222
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,480
What a great show!

223
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,439
This is what I'm talking about!

224
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,442
What's the point of watching someone
win all the time?

225
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,194
This is what I'm talking about!

226
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,825
Before that, they just kept saying
how they felt about each other.

227
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,537
-They kept saying it.
-They kept repeating it.

228
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,791
There wasn't just one confession.
It was never-ending.

229
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,376
They were like a broken record.

230
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,587
It wasn't like the big wham
from Taiko: Drum Master,

231
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,714
but the non-stop repetitive drumming.

232
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,760
-Like the yellow bar.
-Yeah, when you keep drumming.

233
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,221
Like when you keep repeating combos.

234
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,975
It's funny, isn't it?
When you like someone so much...

235
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:03,189
and you didn't get a present
when you were expecting one...

236
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,109
I guess you would be upset.

237
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,278
Of course you would be upset!

238
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,362
"I like you."

239
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,659
She said it twice. She really likes him.

240
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,869
But she still got upset.

241
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,206
-This is really bad.
-I think he got her a gift.

242
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,334
Kentaro still thinks
Yuya has something prepared.

243
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,128
He went to the bathroom for a while
and said he got lost.

244
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,923
He has to have something up his sleeve.

245
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,883
-No way! Right, Torichan?
-Let's watch.

246
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,885
He was just embarrassed about
taking a dump.

247
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,847
-That's why he left?
-Stop it!

248
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,183
-Should we make a toast?
-Yeah.

249
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,945
-It's good.
-The apple cider is good.

250
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,949
-The pumpkin soup is so good. It's sweet.
-It's delicious.

251
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,869
-It's so good.
-It's tasty, isn't it?

252
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,121
What did everyone do on Christmas Eve?

253
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,667
I slept. I had a cold.

254
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,460
Totally asleep.

255
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,506
You went on a date in the morning.

256
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,509
-You did?
-With who?

257
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,719
With Guy.

258
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,429
I'm just kidding.

259
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,391
-The two of us.
-You said it.

260
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,019
It was fun.

261
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,023
-We were carefree.
-A carefree date?

262
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,066
We'll finally all surf together tomorrow.

263
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,026
Finally.

264
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,820
Our schedules never worked.

265
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,783
-The waves were good today.
-They were pretty rough.

266
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,493
-They were, but...
-The shower didn't work today.

267
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,622
-Yeah. What was that about?
-The faucet was stuck. Right?

268
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,750
-I didn't shower.
-Me neither. It was covered in bees.

269
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,627
Did honey come out?

270
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,546
Of course not.
Why would honey come out the shower?

271
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,340
-Because there were bees.
-There were bees.

272
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,802
Because there were bees,
there's honey in the shower?

273
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,096
-You're from a different planet, Guy.
-Seriously!

274
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,473
-He's a mystery.
-I like Guy's planet.

275
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,935
-Guy's planet is great.
-Isn't it?

276
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,770
Did you all prepare gifts?

277
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,357
-We put them there.
-Did everyone?

278
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,318
-I put mine.
-Me, too.

279
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,321
It looks so good! It's so cute!

280
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,364
I'll wash the dishes.

281
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,826
-We can all do it.
-Really? Please do.

282
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,493
Wait, you guys.

283
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,370
That's fine with me.

284
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,289
Don't you want to jump in and volunteer?

285
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,834
-No one did.
-You can do it.

286
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,461
-Taishi, you don't want some?
-I'll have a bite.

287
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,214
-Have more. Here's the Santa.
-Thank you.

288
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,465
Bon appétit.

289
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,551
-Please eat it.
-I can't bring myself to eat that.

290
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,137
Let's do the Secret Santa.

291
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,181
How do we do it?

292
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,559
-We'll all look for our names.
-One person at a time.

293
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:50,022
-One person at a time?
-Guy, you can go find yours first.

294
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,400
-I found it!
-Two?

295
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,236
-There are two?
-There are two.

296
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,822
-You have so many, Guy.
-Maybe there are more.

297
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,574
-More?
-There could be. Look!

298
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,327
The same wrapping paper must be...

299
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,789
Wait, you had three Secret Santas?

300
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,415
-What is it?
-What could it be?

301
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,880
- A bathing suit?
-A Hawaiian shirt maybe.

302
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,925
-There's something else here.
-Wow, so many.

303
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,220
-What's that?
-Sunscreen?

304
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,890
-Oh, it's sunscreen.
-Oh, wow.

305
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,935
-I'm so happy.
-It's the kind you put on your face.

306
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,271
-I totally wanted this.
-It's nice. So cool.

307
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,982
-This is great for surfing.
-Thank you. Who's it from?

308
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,525
We can't say yet.

309
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,236
-Next up.
-Anna.

310
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,739
Perfume?

311
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,533
-What's that?
-Wait.

312
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,369
Oh, wait. This is definitely...

313
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,332
-And a bookmark.
-Someone knows I like to read.

314
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,503
-So it's not from Guy.
-It's not Guy.

315
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,757
This isn't oil, right? It smells so good.

316
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,508
Oh, I know, I know.

317
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,344
You put this in and it smells good.

318
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,013
Thank you!

319
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,433
What's this? I'm so happy!

320
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,978
-What is it?
-A soccer ball! I'm so happy!

321
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,522
-I'm so happy!
-We can all play soccer.

322
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm so happy with my soccer ball.
Insane.

323
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:22,156
-We can play soccer.
-I'm so happy. I really wanted one.

324
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,450
He totally had his reaction planned.

325
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,120
-I didn't!
-You're an actor!

326
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,624
-The single tear.
-Wow.

327
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,376
I'm so happy.

328
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,839
-We can play soccer.
-Yeah, let's play. I'm so happy.

329
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,049
-That's nice wrapping.
-Wow. It's pretty.

330
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,300
The pattern's like a zebra.

331
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,221
It's perfume!

332
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,557
It's Chanel. It's Chanel!

333
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,019
-It's next level.
-Who's it from?

334
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:56,023
-Wow.
-That's a grand slam.

335
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,026
-And it's the one I use.
-I see.

336
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,528
-It's what you use?
-Are you almost out?

337
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:05,449
-I have to take a picture of Lauren.
-What's this?

338
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,828
-What is it?
-This is so cute!

339
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,496
It's a cute pencil.

340
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,582
Oh, it's cute!

341
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,668
-It's so cute!
-Nice!

342
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,256
-Her modelling switch came on.
-Her face is on.

343
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,843
Nice.

344
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,177
-It's cute.
-It's cute.

345
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,472
-You can use it when you draw.
-Right? That's true.

346
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,101
-Oh, wow! Insane.
-What?

347
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,812
Sunscreen, hair wax, snacks...

348
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,691
Wow, so handpicked.

349
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,028
-Amazing.
-Wow, very original.

350
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,031
-There's lots of stuff in there.
-And the wrapping...

351
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,659
-Let's start with Guy.
-Who do you think it's from?

352
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,703
-Avian.
-You're right.

353
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,125
-Who is it?
-Taishi?

354
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,627
You got it.

355
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,463
-Thank you.
-You got it on one try.

356
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,383
We talked about books,

357
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,095
-so I figured it was him.
-Yeah, she didn't have a bookmark.

358
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,599
Lauren?

359
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,481
I told Lauren I play soccer.

360
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,608
Thank you. I'm so happy.

361
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,860
-Wow, a soccer ball.
-I'm so happy.

362
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,821
-I'm glad.
-Yes.

363
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,740
-Yuya.
-Yeah, it's from me.

364
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,495
This is from Guy.

365
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,041
That was quick. Really quick.

366
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,963
-Does it have lenses?
-No.

367
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,424
Thank you.

368
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,969
-From Avian. Right?
-Yeah.

369
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,428
Thank you.

370
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,014
-Should we take out the trash?
-Yeah, let's clean.

371
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,224
Let's clean up!

372
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,019
Avian, can we go downstairs?

373
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,645
Okay.

374
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,689
Where's the soap?

375
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,484
You're going to drink, right?

376
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,987
I can, but...

377
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,949
-You'll be fine.
-Maybe just one more glass.

378
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,620
-Let's drink. It's Christmas.
-Yeah.

379
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:35,974
You might have thought
I forgot about our promise yesterday,

380
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,685
but I never forgot about it.

381
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:46,860
I thought I'd give you your gift
with your Secret Santa present.

382
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,824
That was my plan, but the Secret Santa
was for the six of us.

383
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,746
I realized that the gift has more meaning

384
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,374
if I give it to you when we're alone.

385
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,674
So... wait here a minute.

386
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,645
It's wrapped weird, but...

387
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,731
Open it.

388
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,571
I'm giving it to you today because
I thought it'd be nicer to have two gifts.

389
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,990
I had you as my Secret Santa, too, so...

390
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,415
-Can I open this?
-Yeah.

391
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,794
It's so cute!

392
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,549
You know I like earrings.

393
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,720
Thank you. I'm so happy.

394
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,388
I'll put them on.

395
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,433
Maybe not right now.

396
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,311
I'm so happy.

397
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,859
That's supposed to mean "family."

398
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,653
-This means "family"?
-Yeah.

399
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,365
You're wearing one, too.

400
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,618
Yeah, I bought one for myself.

401
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,205
Really? They match?

402
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,498
Really?

403
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,503
This is the first time
I've had matching jewelry.

404
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,796
-Do you not like that kind of thing?
-I do.

405
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,465
-You do?
-I do.

406
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,716
I'll wear it.

407
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,635
Thank you.

408
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,804
I'm so happy.

409
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,475
I should've given it to you yesterday,
but I ended up giving it to you today.

410
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,977
Thank you.

411
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,401
What?

412
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:54,196
I'm pleased you're so happy about it.

413
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,074
-Yeah.
-I'm happy. It's my first time...

414
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,537
It's my first time
wearing matching bracelets.

415
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,290
You can wear it on your ankle, too.
I got a looser size.

416
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,875
-I prefer the wrist.
-You'd rather wear it on your wrist?

417
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,839
-Can you make it tighter?
-Okay.

418
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,049
-Is this good?
-Yeah.

419
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,639
I'm so happy.
You know how much I like earrings.

420
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,102
-And bracelets.
-I know you like this kind of stuff.

421
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,481
Thank you for the perfume, too.

422
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,233
I'll trim it for you later.

423
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,819
-I'll get scissors.
-Okay.

424
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,739
Thank you. It's cute.

425
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,244
Thank you.

426
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,479
-That's a cute board.
-Right?

427
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,773
-Yeah, here.
-Is it called Fish-something?

428
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,111
It's so short.

429
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,573
-What? My height?
-Your board's so short.

430
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,224
-Thanks for waiting.
-Thank you.

431
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,559
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

432
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,020
That looks good. Are you mixing it?

433
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:32,980
-Want some?
-Yeah.

434
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:33,980
Too bad!

435
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,943
-Bon appétit.
-I'll share. I'll share.

436
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,614
Did you notice their wrists?

437
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,410
-I asked her about it earlier.
-What?

438
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,580
I just noticed you had matching bracelets.

439
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,875
-I gave it to her yesterday.
-It's super cute.

440
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:59,590
-Does that mean the two of you...
-Are in a relationship?

441
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,593
-We're not in a relationship.
-You're not?

442
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:06,513
-Why not? Why are you not?
-What about it?

443
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm being blunt.

444
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,810
-I want to take things slow.
-Why?

445
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,564
-You're really pushing.
-Why?

446
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:22,446
Because we've only recently
gotten to know each other better.

447
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,782
Why leave things undefined?

448
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,828
Why do we have to be in a relationship
just because we like each other?

449
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,663
Don't you want to be?

450
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,250
What does it really mean
to be in a relationship?

451
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,254
-If I may ask?
-He's getting all worked up.

452
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,172
-What's a relationship?
-Are you getting mad?

453
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,424
I'm not mad.

454
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,636
I'm not mad. I'm just wondering
what defines a relationship.

455
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:50,306
-What does it mean for you?
-I don't like undefined relationships.

456
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:53,644
If you like each other
and you're together,

457
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:58,440
but you don't clarify your relationship,
then for me, it's like, "What is this?"

458
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,486
I just want to spend time
with the person I like.

459
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,279
That's nice.

460
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,866
I agree.
We're on the same page about that.

461
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,994
Really? I'm glad.

462
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,711
Lauren, are you using my pencil?

463
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,047
-What?
-Are you using my pencil?

464
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,385
Not yet. It's too nice to use.

465
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,430
When are you doing an exhibit in Japan?

466
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:33,141
-An exhibit in Japan?
-Oh, not Japan. Hawaii.

467
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,350
In one week.

468
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,854
-In Hawaii?
-In one week in Hawaii.

469
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,857
-That's why you're working furiously.
-Yeah.

470
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,985
Maybe I'll go to your exhibit
to be inspired.

471
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,405
-It's in one week?
-Yeah.

472
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,034
-What's your dream?
-My dream?

473
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,496
Maybe that question's too broad.

474
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,416
What's your first step?

475
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:02,504
For my first step,
I'd like to have an exhibit in Tokyo.

476
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,884
So your exhibit in Hawaii
will be your first step?

477
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,385
Yeah.

478
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,431
Hawaii is step one
and Tokyo would be step two.

479
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:19,605
When you start drawing,
what do you think about?

480
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,650
I find happy thoughts are a little boring.

481
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,652
-If you were to draw them?
-Yes.

482
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:26,737
I see.

483
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,656
I draw a lot when I'm sad.

484
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,868
But I'm drawing now
because of the exhibit.

485
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,953
I'm not sad right now.

486
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,913
Surfing is similar.

487
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,668
Your feelings are expressed on the waves.

488
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,257
For me, your drawings are fascinating.

489
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,052
It's totally fascinating.

490
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:56,975
-What kind of guy do you like?
-What kind do I like?

491
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,020
I feel like you're not interested in guys
right now.

492
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,189
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

493
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,442
Thanks for the food.

494
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:09,488
What kind of girls do you like?

495
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,866
Me? Someone spacey.

496
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,786
-Spacey?
-Spacey.

497
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,788
-Someone silly.
-Someone silly!

498
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,094
-Yuya's asleep?
-He is.

499
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,515
-Really?
-I'm awake.

500
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,767
You totally have a cold.

501
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,436
I'm a sick person.

502
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,313
-You should drink this.
-What is it?

503
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,523
It's ginger tea.

504
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:48,944
-Thanks, but I already had some.
-But this is organic ginger.

505
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,863
-You should drink a little.
-It's okay.

506
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,075
Okay, thanks.

507
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:56,743
-Thanks.
-From Lauren.

508
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,037
Oh, from Lauren? Thank you.

509
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,709
Surfing was fun, even if I couldn't stand.

510
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:09,089
Anna was pushing the board for me.

511
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,676
-Did it make you happy?
-It did.

512
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,887
That's good. You look really happy.

513
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,806
It makes me happy, too.

514
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,226
-Why?
-Because you said surfing was fun.

515
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,854
-Yeah, it was.
-And it made you smile.

516
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,065
Of course it makes me happy.

517
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:33,196
But I wanted to have
a deeper conversation with her.

518
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,406
-It's too early. Yeah.
-Is it?

519
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,492
-Am I rushing things?
-It's too fast.

520
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,453
-Is it too early?
-It's only been a week.

521
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,248
-Am I rushing things?
-You're rushing things.

522
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,751
-It's premature.
-Is it?

523
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,419
-You are premature.
-I need to be more patient.

524
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,215
-Good luck with that.
-I know what I need to do.

525
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,344
-I'm sure Anna knows.
-You think?

526
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,305
That you're coming on to her.

527
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,099
I wonder.

528
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,144
I'm sure she's thinking about it.

529
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:08,231
Should I ask her out on a date?
Is it too early?

530
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,276
-You can ask for a date anytime.
-You think?

531
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,945
But don't rush things.

532
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,240
Yeah, I tend to become blind
to everything else.

533
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,956
He did end up giving her
a personal gift, but...

534
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,002
why didn't he give it to her on the 24th?

535
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,047
I think Professor Triendl
here had the right answer.

536
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,508
That's what it is. I think so, too.
Please tell them.

537
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:40,138
Maybe he forgot and bought it that day.

538
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,932
On the 25th.

539
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,934
He forgot, but he acted like he didn't.

540
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,437
It's like when you haven't done
your homework and say you left it at home.

541
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,899
And they like each other, but...

542
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,778
-Yeah, what's that about?
-They're not dating.

543
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,156
"Why do we have to be in a relationship
because we like each other?"

544
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,949
That's something Ozawa would say.

545
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,705
Ozawa... Only Ozawa would understand.

546
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,711
It's true, though.
"Relationship" sounds so formal.

547
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,587
-Don't you think?
-I agree.

548
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,007
-It's true. What is a relationship?
-What is a relationship?

549
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,134
-It's true.
-It's a verbal promise.

550
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,887
What's the difference?
He likes her. She likes him.

551
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:25,016
And even if Anna or someone else
comes along, he won't like them.

552
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,142
It's only Avian for him.

553
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:31,314
How is that different from a relationship?

554
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,607
It's not.

555
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,737
Maybe stronger rules?
Like you can't see someone else.

556
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,364
So it's better
to not be in a relationship.

557
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,201
If possible. For as long as you can.

558
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,578
It's fine if you're both fine.

559
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,539
But, for example, at some point,
the girl may...

560
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,251
If they sleep together
before they're dating

561
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,879
and they continue that relationship,

562
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:59,342
she might want to clarify
that they're in a relationship.

563
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,344
Like, "What do you want?"

564
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,847
We will come back to that issue.

565
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,434
We got a glimpse of Guy's world
at the beginning of the show.

566
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:13,314
-"What if honey comes out?"
-So cute! It's so cute!

567
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,483
He was truly Winnie-the-Pooh
in that moment.

568
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,445
We were all saying, "Oh, it's Pooh!"

569
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,615
After that,
he was eating something yellowish.

570
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,035
A big mound of rice with something yellow.

571
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,703
That wasn't curry. It was honey.

572
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,580
That was honey.

573
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,543
It would be nice
if he was there during a fight.

574
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,211
So cute.

575
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,963
He could stop a fight.

576
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:42,803
You can't get upset at anyone
if someone like Guy is around.

577
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,680
"I broke a dish."

578
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,267
"That's okay! It can't be helped!"

579
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,978
That's a little dangerous.

580
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,565
"I broke a dish."

581
00:37:55,648 --> 00:38:00,028
When asked what kind of girl he likes,
he says, "Someone silly."

582
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,782
He'd be in trouble if he went out
with someone as silly as he is.

583
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,202
He seems like he really would.
There are couples like that.

584
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,744
Silly couples.

585
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,915
-Like they're from another planet.
-Yes.

586
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,918
I wonder if things will continue
without any major problems,

587
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,544
except for the non-relationship issue.

588
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,341
Since Avian and Shibusawa
are lovey-dovey,

589
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,427
Anna and Tamaki may be influenced by it.

590
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,723
But while Anna and Taishi are friendly,

591
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,894
there are shots of Lauren's
unhappy expression again this week.

592
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,312
What does it mean?

593
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,689
And Guy is just really...

594
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:40,401
-He's a really calming presence.
-Guy is just good.

595
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,822
Maybe when someone gets hurt,
he'll gently...

596
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,573
Maybe he'll comfort them.

597
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,993
"Do you want some honey?"

598
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:52,038
What if they say, "No, I don't!
That's not what I need right now"?

599
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,125
"Honey is the best for wounds.

600
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,170
Hold on. Oh, no. I ate it all."

601
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,927
It's been fun lately.
Terrace House has been changing.

602
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,721
-There are new members.
-Three of them.

603
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,181
Are you talking to them?

604
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,434
Guy is very... very interesting.

605
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,145
Surprisingly.

606
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,687
What about Taishi?

607
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,192
What? What's with that smile?

608
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,944
Well, I...

609
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,493
-You went to lunch once, right?
-Yes, we went once.

610
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,246
And you were Taishi's Secret Santa.

611
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,875
-Yeah, I had Taishi.
-He was so happy about the ball.

612
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,461
I really thought about what he'd like,

613
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,173
and I thought he'd like a soccer ball.

614
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,178
How do I say this?

615
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:53,516
After I went to dinner with Taishi...

616
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,269
Not dinner, I mean lunch.

617
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,855
I thought he was really... nice.

618
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,482
Really?

619
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:05,028
I... I can't... I'm embarrassed.

620
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,989
I haven't told anyone.

621
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,659
I'm too embarrassed and too scared.

622
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:19,375
Taishi's really sweet.
He's also very caring.

623
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,004
When we went to lunch,

624
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:27,926
he'd open the car door for me
and that sort of...

625
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,720
-He was a gentleman.
-I really liked that.

626
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,514
I like that kind of behavior.

627
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,684
But...

628
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:42,648
I heard that Taishi is already interested
in someone else.

629
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,401
-You heard?
-I did. From Yuya.

630
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,903
I talked to him earlier.

631
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,200
-We were talking earlier.
-You were?

632
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,329
Just a little.
He asked me what I thought about the guys.

633
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,374
I didn't say anything. I was so scared.

634
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,836
I just said, "Yeah, they seem nice."

635
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,883
You should go on a date with Taishi.

636
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,012
-No, I...
-You don't have to go on a date,

637
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,390
but I think it'd be good
to spend more time with him.

638
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,518
I do want to get to know him better.

639
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:22,313
The two of us haven't really talked.

640
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,482
What should I do?

641
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,528
Right now, I'm just thinking
I'll try to talk to him more.

642
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,739
That's what I'm thinking.
