1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,889
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:18,310
Terrace House is a show about
six strangers living together,

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,187
and we observe how they interact.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,440
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobiles.

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,234
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,820
Last week...

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,574
-It was so sad.
-It was Yusuke and Lauren's movie date.

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,701
Do you want to get dinner?

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,706
-No?
-I have dinner with my grandma on Fridays.

10
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,291
-I see.
-We eat together.

11
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,627
Then don't worry about it.

12
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,088
-I'm sorry today doesn't work.
-Don't worry about it.

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,005
Thanks.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,138
She had dinner plans with her grandma.

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,058
Yusuke ate all alone
at the restaurant he reserved.

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,062
That was seriously bittersweet.

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,522
It's a historic moment in Terrace House.

18
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,275
-It was a memorable scene.
-It was.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,070
And to top it off, he ate catfish.

20
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,532
I'm sure he learned a lot from that.

21
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,702
And he clearly said
he'll give up on her

22
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,787
and immerse himself in his music.

23
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,789
I'm going to give it up.

24
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,001
I should focus more on what I need to do.

25
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:30,090
I'm sorry, but I'm beginning to believe
that Lauren might not be very nice.

26
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,800
-In your opinion.
-Yes.

27
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,886
I'm the opinionated neighbor.

28
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,806
-And Naomi...
-Yes, Naomi.

29
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,559
She told Avian how she really feels
before announcing that she's leaving.

30
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:46,439
My last boyfriend of six years
had the exact same name.

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,025
-Yuya?
-Yeah.

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,486
I was drunk on the feeling
of calling him that.

33
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,948
Her excuse is appalling.
Yuya has the same name as her ex.

34
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,158
That's a new one.

35
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,870
She may have just said that...

36
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,079
For Avian's sake.

37
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,791
Since Naomi's leaving,

38
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,711
do you think we'll see the new person
right after she leaves?

39
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,298
I hope Seina comes during the transition.

40
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,842
Isn't that too strong for a transition?

41
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,136
Yeah, the transition may take over.

42
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,808
I'm leaving.

43
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,810
What?

44
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,604
You're kidding.

45
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,733
Really?

46
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,611
Really?

47
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,197
Seriously?

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,536
My original reason for coming here
was to remember how to speak English.

49
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,455
But...

50
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,751
being here, conversing...

51
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,129
I remembered more than I expected.

52
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,842
So, for me...

53
00:02:54,925 --> 00:03:00,097
I've already achieved my main purpose.

54
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,683
I've completed my goal.

55
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,353
If I stay here, then my purpose would be

56
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,773
just living in Hawaii
and working part-time.

57
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,524
That's all it would be.

58
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,070
I felt like that wasn't right.

59
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:22,327
So, even though it's early,
this is the best choice for me.

60
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,998
I'm sorry, I'm going to cry.

61
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,625
Don't cry. I don't want to cry either.

62
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,043
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,047
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,300
I wasn't expecting this.

65
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,388
We've become friends.

66
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:47,394
If you hadn't been here,
I wouldn't have been able to do anything.

67
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,605
Don't say that.

68
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,694
I probably couldn't have gotten my job.

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,449
I couldn't even call them.

70
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,245
I didn't even have a cell phone.

71
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,624
You've taken care of me this whole time,

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,253
but can you do me one more favor?

73
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:19,092
I want to go out
with everyone on Sunday.

74
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,305
It could be the mountains or the beach.

75
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,515
-Yeah.
-For the last time...

76
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,600
Let's do what you want to do.

77
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:33,231
I was wondering
if you can make sure everyone is free.

78
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,778
Let's spend lots of time together
while you're still here.

79
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,948
Let's enjoy Hawaii together while we can.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,076
Let's have a fun lunch.

81
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,078
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,997
The food got cold.

83
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,104
Good evening.

84
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,565
What's wrong?

85
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,318
How are things going?

86
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,946
How was your date with Lauren?

87
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,993
You looked really sad.

88
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,911
I was wondering if you're okay.

89
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,835
If she had to force herself to come...

90
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,131
I wish she had just told me
that she didn't feel like going.

91
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,718
I've already told Yuya and Eric
that I'm giving up.

92
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,179
-That's how you feel?
-Yeah.

93
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,558
In all likelihood,
she's not interested in me at all.

94
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,813
She may have gone as a friend.

95
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,608
But she didn't tell you that?

96
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,235
Lauren didn't say anything?

97
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,364
I think she realized it was a date.

98
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,033
I see.

99
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,038
But apparently she asked Yuya and Eric...

100
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,835
if they had pushed me into doing it.

101
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,465
She asked me about that.

102
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,551
So I told her they didn't.

103
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,012
-It was your decision.
-Yes, I told her that.

104
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,097
That's probably why she came.

105
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:35,395
But Lauren did say
that she enjoyed the movie

106
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,232
and that she wanted
to get to know you better.

107
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,569
-Did she?
-Yeah.

108
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,198
But listening to you,
it doesn't sound like that at all.

109
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,825
So I'm a little shocked.

110
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,830
How are things with Yuya?

111
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,082
What?

112
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,625
-You.
-How are things?

113
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,253
Hanging out with him is fun.

114
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,380
Nice.

115
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,718
I'm starting to see

116
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:11,056
that he's really good
at reading people's expressions.

117
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,641
Yuya's an amazing guy.

118
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,561
-That's weird coming from me.
-Yeah, he surprised me.

119
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,980
When I'm tired...

120
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,316
-He's observant.
-...or when I'm thinking about work.

121
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,777
He cheered me up the other day.

122
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,238
It made me happy.

123
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,243
Yuya's nice, right?

124
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,910
Surprisingly.

125
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,454
-Surprisingly?
-Surprisingly.

126
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,331
Surprisingly? That's terrible.

127
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:41,253
People tend to see him in different ways.

128
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,879
Yeah.

129
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:48,843
But I think the people who know him
have a different opinion.

130
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,889
That's true. Yeah.

131
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,810
Well, enjoy your time with Yuya.

132
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:03,108
Talking like this makes me think
you've really matured.

133
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,443
-Right now?
-Yeah.

134
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,488
You've totally different
than you were in the beginning.

135
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,615
Not yet. I still want to become...

136
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,285
-Seriously, though.
-...stronger.

137
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,206
I'll always cheer you on.

138
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,125
Thanks.

145
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,589
There's something I wanted to ask.

146
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,883
Does the Thanksgiving dinner...

147
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,430
have to be on the 24th?

148
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,477
The 24th would be
my first holiday here...

149
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,730
that I could spend with everyone.

150
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,067
-So it'd be nice, if it were on the 24th.
-I see, I see.

151
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,530
But you made plans with your parents,
so you can't make the 24th, right?

152
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,533
You knew we'd be doing
Thanksgiving dinner,

153
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,078
but you didn't know
it would be on the 24th, right?

154
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,581
-You didn't know, so...
-Yeah, I wasn't thinking.

155
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,543
So the next time you schedule something...

156
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,922
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't keep changing on us.

157
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,259
I'll talk it over with my sisters.

158
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,345
I know you're double-booked...

159
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,516
and I know you want to spend time
with your family.

160
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,647
We can have our dinner earlier,
and you can go after.

161
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,776
I might get in trouble, but okay.
That can't be helped.

162
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,569
And before...

163
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,196
Why would you get in trouble?

164
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,868
Like, why am I prioritizing Terrace House?

165
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,414
You just have to explain to them, right?

166
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
It's not prioritizing.

167
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,670
Naomi's never spent the holidays here.

168
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,757
But you can do both, right?

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,802
Yeah, and if I get in trouble then...

170
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,143
Yeah, but...

171
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,374
Then don't tell us you'll be in trouble.

172
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,297
Otherwise, we'll feel bad about it.

173
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,468
You don't have to spend
the whole day with us.

174
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,887
And you don't have to cancel your plans.

175
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,016
You look like you're about to cry.

176
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,979
I know you love your family.

177
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,107
So you don't have to force yourself.

178
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,487
I just want to spend a little time
with you that day.

179
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,073
I'm sorry.
I don't even know why I'm crying.

180
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:43,703
I'd probably feel the same way
if we were in Japan.

181
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,830
I'm sorry for crying.

182
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,207
It's totally okay.

183
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,712
Why?

184
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,924
Nothing's happened, but I'm just...

185
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,511
stressed.

186
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,017
Talk to us.

187
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,752
If you tell us you'll get in trouble...

188
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,088
I want you to think about
how that makes us feel, too.

189
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,966
I didn't mean to say it like that.

190
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,594
Like, "Oh, I'll get it in trouble."

191
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm going to disappear for a bit.

192
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,609
I'm sorry I couldn't say anything.

193
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,278
I'm sorry I let you do everything.

194
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,197
You should speak up, too,
and say you want it on the 24th.

195
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,035
Should I tell Lauren?

196
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,244
What do you mean?

197
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:35,082
She doesn't know
why I want it on the 24th,

198
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,585
so I think it's causing her stress.

199
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,012
Have you calmed down a bit?

200
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:57,188
With regard to what happened,
there's something I want to tell you.

201
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,898
I'm...

202
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,902
After Thanksgiving...

203
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,449
I'm leaving here.

204
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:09,909
Seriously?

205
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,329
Oh, no! I'm going to cry again!

206
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,209
Yeah, so, that's why...

207
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:24,048
Thanksgiving is the only American holiday
I'll be spending with everyone.

208
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,009
-That's why.
-It'll be my first and last one.

209
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,056
I had told Avian.

210
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,810
So Avian was upset...

211
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,271
because she knew my situation.

212
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,984
Naomi!

213
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,905
Can I hug you?

214
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,755
That was a little...

215
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,841
-It was heavy!
-It was hard to breathe.

216
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,176
-It was a little suffocating.
-A little.

217
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,804
Terrace House has been suffocating lately.

218
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,850
Something tiny turns into a huge deal.

219
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,893
-Right?
-Yeah.

220
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,352
Sparks fly.

221
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:24,233
You all tend to see Lauren
through rose-colored glasses.

222
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,778
I think you guys are insane.

223
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:31,533
When her mascara was running,
you said, "How beautiful."

224
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,244
Everything she does is perfect.

225
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,664
-Artistic, you mean?
-No, a little...

226
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,041
erotic.

227
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,125
Erotic.

228
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,212
I can't help but feel that way.

229
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,215
I don't think it's just miswording.

230
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,011
She simply tends to fight dirty, right?

231
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:57,099
She tends to mention things
she knows will make others angry.

232
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,270
Like, "I'll change my plans,
but if as a result...

233
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,524
I get in trouble, I'll take care of it."

234
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,653
If you're going to take care of it,
don't mention it.

235
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,657
That's true.
So what Avian was saying is right.

236
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,993
But Avian, too,
from a Japanese point of view...

237
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,203
If this was Japan,

238
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,498
you'd think to yourself,
"Why would you mention that?"

239
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,628
But when Avian is upset,
she comes out and says it.

240
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,966
I'd hate for someone to tell me
they're stressed out.

241
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,467
Well...

242
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,973
She did mention from the start
that living with others wasn't really...

243
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,602
She uses her family as an excuse
whenever she doesn't want to do something.

244
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,353
That's true.

245
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,480
What was surprising was that

246
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,359
they didn't mention
they wanted to get together on the 24th

247
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,152
because Naomi is leaving.

248
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,697
-Yeah, that was a little...
-They should've.

249
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,908
Avian knew,
and that's why she was especially upset.

250
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,577
She came on strong.

251
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,663
Since Avian was left in charge
of everyone's schedule,

252
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,373
she became the organizer.

253
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:08,295
It could be that they were going to
keep it secret until then.

254
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,507
So upon hearing that Naomi's leaving,

255
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,635
is Lauren willing to talk to her family?

256
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,094
I wonder.

257
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,389
I can't help but think
she could've done that from the start.

258
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
Hey.

259
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,775
-How are you?
-You don't need the charger?

260
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,277
I'm at 100%.

261
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,696
And it would never reach.

262
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,033
No more T-shirts to cut?

263
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,535
-Not right now.
-I want to do that.

264
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,120
-You do?
-I want to.

265
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,496
I'll bring back more.

266
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,082
How was your day?

267
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,208
I was at the shop.

268
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,085
-The whole time?
-Yeah.

269
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,630
Yeah, my shift is going to change.

270
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,714
-Really?
-Yeah.

271
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,008
-What time?
-Yeah, it's been decided.

272
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:59,681
I'll be at the store at 10:00 a.m.,
and I'll finish around 4:00 p.m.

273
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,266
If you're home earlier, we can talk more.

274
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,060
That's true.

275
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,188
Because we only talk before we go to bed.

276
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
That's true.

277
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,733
What did you do?

278
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,068
-Today?
-Yeah.

279
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,279
I went to school, then I came home.

280
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,657
What about that thing with Eric?

281
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,491
Oh, Eric's thing?

282
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,203
I finished early
and there was nothing for me to do.

283
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,164
-Oh, you finished early?
-Yeah. I came home.

284
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,124
What do you do at Eric's?

285
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,585
I help out. I sand.

286
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,213
-You do that the whole time?
-Yeah.

287
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,799
You're always with Eric.

288
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,760
-It's fine, but...
-I'm helping out.

289
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,471
That's fine, but...

290
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,483
Since you want to get into acting,

291
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:57,029
you should go to an acting school
or something here.

292
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,907
Then you can make friends.

293
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,704
It seems like it would be
a good environment to be in.

294
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,206
-That kind of group.
-That's true.

295
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,888
What are you drawing?

296
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,849
-A turkey.
-Oh!

297
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,643
Nice.

298
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,071
Everyone bought so much.

299
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,418
Oh, by turkey, you mean the bird.

300
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,677
-You're really good.
-Not at all.

301
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,728
-I've been meaning to ask...
-Yes?

302
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,647
How was it?

303
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,733
Did you have fun?

304
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,946
-The movie?
-Yeah, the movie.

305
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,697
Yeah, it was fun.

306
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,159
It was. And the movie was great.

307
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,705
That's all I wanted to know.

308
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,043
Did you have fun?

309
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,004
Yeah, the movie was fun. Totally.

310
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,302
Well, you seem busy.

311
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,762
I'm going to get some rest.

312
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,672
-Everyone went to sleep so early.
-Yeah.

313
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,050
-I wonder why.
-It's so quiet.

314
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,388
Your feet are cold!

315
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,391
-I get cold easily.
-Super cold.

316
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,353
Are your feet ticklish?

317
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,524
Stop that! Seriously.

318
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,485
I'm sleepy.

319
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,237
I think I can sleep here.

320
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,531
-This is the perfect spot, isn't it?
-Yeah.

321
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,743
-Can I sleep here?
-You're going to catch a cold if you do.

322
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,954
Should I get a blanket for now?

323
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,498
-Sure.
-You want one?

324
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,085
-No, don't worry.
-Okay.

325
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,213
Thank you.

326
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,447
ELLIOTT GRAHAM, 23 YEARS OLD
CREATIVE DIRECTOR

327
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,116
-How are you?
-I'm good.

328
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,621
How is the design for the sign going?

329
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,665
For the design...

330
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:43,380
If we use acrylic paint,
the colors will be a little different.

331
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,840
It'll be different.

332
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,135
-So I'll use a computer.
-Nice.

333
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,678
For the background...

334
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,014
Maybe blue?

335
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,143
-Should we make it blue?
-Blue might not work.

336
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,325
The pop-up store...

337
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,328
When will it be ready?

338
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,663
The beginning of next month.

339
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,208
We plan on opening then.

340
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,418
-We'll make it, right?
-Yeah.

341
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,629
How was your date?

342
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,089
I knew you'd ask.

343
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,717
Yeah, it was fun.

344
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,303
He said he wished he could've talked more.

345
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,181
-I could tell.
-Yeah?

346
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,226
You were focused on the movie?

347
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,771
That wasn't the reason?

348
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,150
You just didn't want to?

349
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,027
That's rough.

350
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,614
If it had been a Thursday,
would you have gone to dinner?

351
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,742
Yeah, probably.

352
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,494
-You would've?
-Probably.

353
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,789
So it wasn't just an excuse.

354
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:05,129
No, it wasn't an excuse.
My grandma really made me dinner.

355
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,802
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

356
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,970
Cheers.

357
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,932
I can reach.

358
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,147
-It's good.
-Apple cider.

359
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,607
-It's good.
-Tastes natural.

360
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,695
It's the first time
I'm having crab on Thanksgiving.

361
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,030
-Yeah?
-It's nice. Very Hawaiian.

362
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,866
-Is it?
-Yeah, Thanksgiving here

363
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,036
is different from the mainland.
It's a little...

364
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,291
-That's true, it is.
-Yeah.

365
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,418
It's been a while
since we all ate together.

366
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,377
That's true.

367
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,753
This is happiness.

368
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,591
-Seriously.
-It's great!

369
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,011
There's something I wanted to tell you.

370
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,639
I'm...

371
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,602
leaving Terrace House.

372
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,686
Seriously?

373
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,730
No way.

374
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,234
Have you decided which day?

375
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,611
If you're free this Sunday...

376
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,572
I wanted to go to the beach with everyone.

377
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,491
Electric Beach?

378
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,827
Eric mentioned it before.

379
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,996
-You said it was nice.
-For snorkeling.

380
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,040
I've been talking about snorkeling
with Avian and Lauren.

381
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:27,211
-I see.
-We bought new bathing suits.

382
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,130
The last hurrah.

383
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,590
-I'll leave Sunday open.
-Please.

384
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,091
I'm always free.

385
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,136
We all know that.

386
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,180
-Leave it open.
-Definitely.

387
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,605
The weather is great.

388
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,565
I'm glad it's sunny.

389
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,362
I thought it might rain.

390
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,822
It's nice today.

391
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,326
-We'll probably see dolphins.
-It's so sunny.

392
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,327
Dolphins.

393
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,620
-Really?
-Yeah.

394
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,955
-This is where you snorkel?
-Yeah.

395
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,124
It looks like it.

396
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,593
-Rub and rinse?
-Right. Rub it all over.

397
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,181
Never.

398
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,809
-Like this?
-Nice.

399
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,356
-You've never snorkeled, right?
-This is my first time ever.

400
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,441
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

401
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,694
-This is my first time snorkeling.
-Nice.

402
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,447
-Should I go rinse it?
-No, it's okay.

403
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,157
-That's it?
-Yeah, just leave it.

404
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:41,868
The other way.

405
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,357
-Did you have fun?
-It was amazing.

406
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,109
-I'm glad.
-Seriously.

407
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,904
It was great.
I didn't think it would be this fun.

408
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,157
-It was amazing, wasn't it?
-It really was!

409
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,659
There were so many fish.

410
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,329
It was great!

411
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,291
It was so pretty!

412
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:16,963
-The turtle's so cute!
-When do you see something like that?

413
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,965
-Right?
-It's so nice.

414
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,050
Avian's bottom.

415
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,844
-Avian's bottom was nice.
-She has a very nice bottom.

416
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,846
-From the hips down.
-She's shapely!

417
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,058
The curves only women have.

418
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,726
It's splendid.

419
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,939
And things are starting to heat up
between Yuya and Avian.

420
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,774
-All that flirting.
-Touching her feet.

421
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,694
On that couch. That's a nice one.

422
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,738
-"Are your feet ticklish?"
-Right?

423
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,407
Very cute.

424
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,991
That was asking for a kiss.

425
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,412
-Why didn't they?
-They aren't official yet.

426
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,123
Do you kiss
only after you start going out?

427
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,209
-Don't you?
-"Okay, we're together!

428
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,586
Now let's kiss."

429
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,504
-What kind of kiss is that?
-Lame!

430
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,840
-Totally lame.
-Totally lame.

431
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,010
-"What's happening? What are we?"
-"What's going on?"

432
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,972
-Then, "Oh, we kissed."
-Now that's exciting.

433
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,390
"Oh, we kissed!"

434
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,726
"Wait, we did kiss."

435
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,811
-Right?
-Right.

436
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,230
You're the only ones getting excited here.

437
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,109
And the awkwardness
between Yusuke and Lauren.

438
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,402
It was awkward.

439
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:23,279
Did you really have to draw
that picture, Lauren?

440
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:28,660
She felt a little uncomfortable
talking to him,

441
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,705
so drawing was her escape.

442
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:36,167
And her conversation
with Eric and his friend...

443
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,379
I really didn't like that.

444
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,172
-That's usually how it goes.
-Yes, it is.

445
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,425
-That's how it is.
-I see.

446
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,718
Shit-head.

447
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,472
Shit-head?

448
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,393
I haven't heard that term in a while.

449
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:56,271
Lauren, if you're watching this,
don't ever watch Yama Channel.

450
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,526
-That's right.
-It looks like there's no escape.

451
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,944
I'm going all out
on these last two episodes.

452
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,699
-Should we toast?
-To the last night.

453
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,960
What are you all going to do?

454
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,547
-Same as usual?
-Same as usual.

455
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,216
Continue working
so I can open my main café.

456
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,135
-Yeah.
-I'll work hard.

457
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,387
Same for me.

458
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,930
-School?
-Yeah.

459
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,974
How about you, Lauren?

460
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,564
I want to have a gallery exhibit.
It's in discussion.

461
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,357
-And you, Avian?
-Me?

462
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,446
I want to start my own brand.

463
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,531
Maybe bikinis.

464
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,949
I'm thinking about it.

465
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,283
And you, Yusuke?

466
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,910
-Eggplant?
-Want a bell pepper?

467
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,705
-The meat is so good!
-Me?

468
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,083
I wanted to talk to you.

469
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,835
Do you mind?

470
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,878
-Right now? Sure.
-Yeah.

471
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,964
-What's wrong?
-What's up?

472
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,632
-See you in a bit.
-Yeah.

473
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:09,135
-I'll save you some.
-Yeah, save me a little.

474
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,972
What...

475
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,016
-What's going on?
-I have no idea.

476
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,893
He looked serious.

477
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,278
What's up?

478
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:32,117
You're leaving
Terrace House tomorrow, right?

479
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,121
I probably won't be here then, so...

480
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,916
I thought I'd just tell you now.

481
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm thinking of leaving soon, too.

482
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,385
I haven't really talked to you
about the date with Lauren.

483
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:56,266
It didn't really go the way I pictured.

484
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,647
But she came,
and it was a good experience.

485
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,275
From now on...

486
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,361
I won't have to keep asking
Eric and Yuya...

487
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,490
for advice.

488
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,911
I can have the confidence on my own...

489
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,872
to talk to people.

490
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,167
I think I'll be able to do
the things I want.

491
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,712
I think you'll be okay.

492
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,924
You've been actively talking
to everyone lately.

493
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,178
You're totally different from before.

494
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,766
Thanks for telling me first.

495
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,850
For me...

496
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,396
the current members
are the Terrace House members.

497
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,233
I'm really glad to have met everyone.

498
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,652
That's how I feel.

499
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,238
This is tough.
