1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,310
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,187
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,357
All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,401
-There is no script at all.
-Not at all.

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,946
-Well, well, well... So last week...
-It's here.

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
It's here...

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,033
Ugly drama is back at <i>Terrace House.</i>

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:38,330
-Yuuki Byrnes has now joined.
-The new member is very handsome.

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,791
I'm a dancer.

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,542
-A dancer?
-Yes, a dancer.

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,794
What kind?

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,255
-The style is called Krumping.
-Krump?

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,465
Oh, like the band Exile?

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,843
I also model once in a while,
when I feel like it.

17
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,054
Now that Byrnes is here,

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,850
<i>Terrace House</i> is experiencing
the calm before the storm.

19
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:03,480
-That's right.
-Two couples were nicely paired up,

20
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,149
but now we've got a love triangle,
or even a love square.

21
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,945
-Maybe even a love hexagon.
-Yes.

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,738
I think Misaki...

23
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,616
is really pretty.

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,037
-Misaki also finds Byrnes attractive.
-Yes.

25
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:24,835
-But...
-Rikopin also finds Byrnes attractive.

26
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,337
He's her type. But since she's not his,

27
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,133
she's decided to sit on the sidelines
and observe for now.

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,177
She feels she's got the disadvantage.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,017
He's tall and half-Japanese.
He's totally my type.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,601
So he's perfect then!

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,769
Yeah.

32
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,813
But he...

33
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,442
seems to be into one of the other girls.

34
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,484
Really?

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,279
No, I'm not going to stop.

36
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,364
So you do like him.

37
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,117
I meant I'm not the type
to stop liking someone

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,786
just because a friend likes him too.

39
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,374
When Byrnes said to Misaki
that they should go somewhere...

40
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,420
She asked if it'll be the two of them,
as though she was testing him.

41
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,506
Did you see Rikopin's expression
when he said yes?

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,093
That was the face of a woman
about to make a move.

43
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,765
Let's go grab food when you're free.

44
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,476
Just the two of us? Or with everyone?

45
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,645
It could be either.

46
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,607
The question is
what Terashima's next move will be.

47
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:34,196
Is he gonna flounder?
Or will he be mature and quietly withdraw?

48
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,115
No way! It's the start of a new act,
starring Terashima.

49
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,867
-Oh, you mean in Yokohama?
-Yes, in Yokohama.

50
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,994
I wonder if there's gonna be
a Yokohama scene.

51
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,497
It's gonna be quite the show this week.

52
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,540
It's like Yokohama's a scary place now.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,793
Something's gonna happen...

54
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,420
Nothing good has ever happened
in Yokohama on <i>Terrace House.</i>

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,173
-So true.
-I detect something foul.

56
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,347
NAKAMEGURO, TOKYO

57
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,307
Yuuki, can you grab the lid?

58
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,519
Thanks.

59
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,319

KIKUNO KURIHARA

00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,747
-What do you mean?
-I mean at the house.

65
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,582
It's pretty fun.

66
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,294
-Have you made friends with the guys?
-Yeah.

67
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,380
Any cute girls?

68
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,258
Cute?

69
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,801
Yeah, actually.

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,302
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

71
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,971
There's one girl...

72
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,141
Her name is Misaki.

73
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,812
I asked her out.

74
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,189
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

75
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,443
-How old is she?
-She's the same age as me.

76
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,528
-Nice.
-Twenty-three.

77
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,863
Just for dinner?

78
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,531
Yeah, just for food.

79
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,743
What about a movie
or something beforehand?

80
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,495
Isn't that more of a date?

81
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,206
I hadn't thought of that.

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,253
I was just thinking if we go out to eat,
we could talk and get to know each other.

83
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,672
-That's a good start.
-Yeah.

84
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,925
I guess that's better
than trying to do a bunch of stuff.

85
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,596
SANGEN-JAYA, TOKYO

86
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,861
-Hey, were you waiting long?
-Not at all.

87
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,321
Really? Sorry I'm late.

88
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,448
-I'm so hungry.
-Yeah, me too.

89
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,534
What are we having?

90
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:45,994
Yakitori.

91
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,289
Yakitori? Yay! I love it.

92
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,584
TORIJIRO

93
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,085
What's good here?

94
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,296
I think everything is good here.

95
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,631
Right.

96
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,508
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

97
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,263
Yum!

98
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,309
Yeah, a beer after work is the best.

99
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,978
-That's right, you had work today.
-Yeah, until 5:00 p.m.

100
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,271
Want some?

101
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,357
Thanks.

102
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,859
I don't usually do this for someone.

103
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,613
-Is this good?
-Yeah.

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,535
-I wanna talk about personal stuff today.
-Sure.

105
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,537
What type of guy do you like?

106
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,373
Someone who cares about others.

107
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,875
That's important.

108
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,920
I don't really have a type.
If I like someone, I just like him.

109
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,173
Even if I'm asked why,
I wouldn't have an answer.

110
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,510
-You wouldn't?
-If I like someone, I just like him.

111
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,221
What about at <i>Terrace House?</i>

112
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,806
Is there someone?

113
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,308
-There was.
-That's right.

114
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,561
Oh, that's right.

115
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,689
And now I don't like hot springs.

116
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,898
Why?

117
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,067
On our first date,

118
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,447
he mentioned he wanted to go
to the hot springs with me.

119
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:11,538
But later on, he said he didn't want to go
in the co-ed baths with me.

120
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,664
I see.

121
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,877
So now when I hear <i>hot springs</i>,
that's all I think of.

122
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,214
-I see.
-I've been traumatized by hot springs.

123
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,175
I was talking with Riko.

124
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,762
She asked me where we'd be going.

125
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,558
I told her Hakone.

126
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,854
But I wasn't thinking
of the hot springs there.

127
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,731
-I see.
-I didn't mean the hot springs.

128
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,735
I was thinking of taking you
to a great soba place there,

129
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,530
and taking the gondola up the mountain.

130
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,534
-My plan was to have a relaxing day.
-Sounds great.

131
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,454
But I thought
maybe I'd give the wrong idea.

132
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,207
That sounds great.
You can take me there next time.

133
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,876
Let's go after I get my license then.

134
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,294
When will that be?

135
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,671
-Next week, I'll pass the test for sure.
-Oh, that's right.

136
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,798
-Ride with me then.
-Okay, I will.

137
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,260
-Is it your first time?
-Yeah.

138
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,347
I drive safely, so don't worry.

139
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,890
You seem like a good driver.

140
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,728
Have you gotten over the guy you liked?

141
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,146
Oh yeah, totally.

142
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,192
We all get together as a group sometimes,
but I'm fine.

143
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,570
Honestly!

144
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,156
I think of it as a good experience.

145
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,453
-I was initially attracted to his looks.
-His looks?

146
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,121
Yeah, he was really good looking.

147
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,209
What did he look like?
I guess it'd be hard to describe.

148
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,211
Well, he was half-Japanese.

149
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,589
I'm half-Japanese.

150
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,180
-That's true, but so is Arman.
-That's right.

151
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,392
Arman is half-Japanese, too.

152
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,729
But I'm not attracted to Arman at all.

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,858
-I mean, if someone...
-What about me?

154
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,112
Right now...

155
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,446
-Am I a possibility?
-Right now...

156
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,158
Yes, for now.

157
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,326
-I am?
-Yeah.

158
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,542
Why are you embarrassed
when you're the one who said it?

159
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,794
Never mind.

160
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,506
-I feel so tight.
-You do?

161
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,133
I'm gonna unbutton the top button.

162
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,260
That's totally fine with me.

163
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,388
I love that about you. It's hilarious.

164
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,475
Excuse me.
I promise my zipper is still closed.

165
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,105
Girls are usually shy
about things like that.

166
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,607
I don't need that shyness.

167
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,651
Oh, that reminds me!

168
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:51,823
I want someone who can accept me as I am.

169
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,325
There's no need for you to change at all.

170
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,411
In my opinion, anyway.

171
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,371
The reason I was rejected...

172
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,540
He told me I had no core self.

173
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:01,958
No core?

174
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,920
-Why?
-I don't... Well, maybe I am like that.

175
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,300
But since I was told that before,
what you said made me happy.

176
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,055
You totally have a core self!

183
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,228
-Hey, Yuuchan.
-I'm home.

184
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,396
-Welcome back.
-I'm back!

185
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,315
Are you drunk?

186
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,985
I was so nervous that I drank too much.

187
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,531
-Nice.
-I was attracted to her from the start.

188
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,577
Now... even more so.

189
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,164
What was her reaction?

190
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:28,545
We talked about whether she could see me
as a potential boyfriend.

191
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,464
And she said she could.

192
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,883
That was quick.

193
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,635
-Yeah.
-Aren't things moving pretty fast?

194
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,720
-So you're happy.
-Yeah, it made me super happy.

195
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,597
It made me happy.

196
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,393
She does seem interested in you.

197
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,894
-Right, Arman?
-Really?

198
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,814
-It's pretty obvious.
-Right?

199
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,149
-No way.
-For real.

200
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,191
-Lucky you.
-Yeah.

201
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,988
Seriously, I am interested in her.

202
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,866
-You guys make a good match.
-Yeah.

203
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,619
-Did you drink a lot?
-Yeah, I drank a lot.

204
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,539
-You did?
-Yeah, I drank a lot.

205
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,544
We talked about relationships and work.

206
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,131
You look like you had fun.

207
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,094
We made plans for another date.

208
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,054
-The next one?
-Yeah.

209
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,016
He asked me if I could see him
as a potential boyfriend.

210
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,019
I said I might.

211
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,856
I'm so happy today. So happy!

212
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,318
I'm so happy!

213
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,528
I'm just gonna...

214
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,280
Are you gonna sleep like that?

215
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:43,536
Don't worry. I'll just change in here.

216
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,208
I really had fun today. It's been so long.

217
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,002
-I'm happy for you.
-Yeah.

218
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,466
They look really happy.

219
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,178
-It has begun for them.
-It certainly has.

220
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,307
Both of them want to just be themselves.

221
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,809
They're alike in that sense.

222
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,438
And to have their date in Sangen-jaya?
Great choice.

223
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,689
It is.

224
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,317
Sangen-jaya is the place
to bare your soul.

225
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,028
-Really?
-Yes.

226
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,615
He refuted everything
that hurt her before.

227
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,577
She laid out all her dissatisfactions
with Hikaru Ota.

228
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,120
HIKARU OTA

229
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,539
And when Byrnes came home,

230
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,668
Terashima tells him how that sounds good
in his lounged position.

231
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,127
The ridiculousness of it!

232
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,840
The way he acts like he knows it all...

233
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,133
I can't get enough of it!

234
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,303
I mean, he can't even tell
what the girl he likes is thinking.

235
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,807
-Terrible.
-I love it!

236
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:50,353
I mean, she's trying so hard
to contain herself from her perfect guy.

237
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,980
And she looks back to Terashima.

238
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,982
Of course she's gonna question
her decision.

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,860
Terashima is really not that bad.

240
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:03,700
Really, Riko has only gone out with him
a few times.

241
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,952
But Terashima is in love with her.

242
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,163
He is, and he acts like she's his.

243
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,540
Hold on.

244
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,293
Until recently,
you were calling him Hayato.

245
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,381
But now you disparagingly refer to him
as Terashima.

246
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,550
He's setting things up for us.

247
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,972
We'll know how Rikopin really feels
when she's on that date in Yokohama.

248
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,851
It'll be interesting to see
how Hayato acts.

249
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,186
He's gonna come on strong.

250
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,398
Right now, Riko is putting on the brakes
for her interest in Byrnes.

251
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,735
So, if Terashima plays it smart,

252
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,112
then he can come across as the good guy
in Riko's eyes.

253
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,030
Right.

254
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,450
But the wrong move
will turn Riko away from him.

255
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,701
That's true.

256
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,288
Riko's been concerned about
their age difference the entire time.

257
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:56,294
So if he says something like,
"I knew you'd put that in your noodles..."

258
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:02,133
If he says it like that,
she might think it's because he's old.

259
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,387
It's all over if she thinks that.

260
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,640
YOTSUKAIDO, CHIBA

261
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,643
KAORI BALLET STUDIO

262
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,312
When are you performing?

263
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,691
-Next Saturday.
-Saturday? Oh, I see.

264
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,817
KAORI KAWABATA
INSTRUCTOR

265
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,405
If it's right before your competition,
you might want to put more effort into it.

266
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,659
-Yes, that's why I'd like you to see it.
-All right.

267
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,161
Let's begin.

268
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,545
Hold the turnout.

269
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,047
One.

270
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,883
Two.

271
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,803
Three. Very nice.

272
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,016
Turnout.

273
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,816
Raise your arms. Now tighten.

274
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,860
Core, core, core.

275
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,612
And last move, up.

276
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,906
And the finish.

277
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,201
-Wipe yourself off.
-Yes.

278
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,369
Now...

279
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:17,125
Do you feel focused on ballet right now?

280
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,340
I feel like I'm doing what I need to do,
while still having fun at the house.

281
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,301
Whether you can become a pro or not

282
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:32,640
depends on whether or not
you can give your all to ballet.

283
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,436
If you don't have that kind of mindset,

284
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:41,524
I don't think you'll be able to become
a professional ballet dancer.

285
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:47,238
So, everything you do throughout the day
should be for ballet.

286
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,285
It's something you need to decide now,
considering your age.

287
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,371
I know that this is my last chance.

288
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,331
You also should lose some more weight.

289
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,374
Yes.

290
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:03,087
You're not eating the same things
as everyone else, are you?

291
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:09,051
As a ballerina,
you need to be able to restrain yourself.

292
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,553
Yes.

293
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,097
-Can I do this nail?
-Sure.

294
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,810
You're good at this.

295
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,105
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

296
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,484
-You look tired, Momochan.
-I am.

297
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,736
You've got ballerina head.

298
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,281
Yeah, I showed my competition piece
to my teacher today.

299
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,868
I've been taking lessons from her
since junior high school.

300
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,954
And... well...

301
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,456
-She had a lot to say?
-Yeah.

302
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:43,377
She said it'd be tough to make it as a pro
if I don't change my ways.

303
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:49,300
Maybe it was naive of me
to have a lifestyle outside of ballet.

304
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,637
She said she could tell
from seeing me dance just once.

305
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:57,975
So do you have a goal
for this competition?

306
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,440
I want to produce results,
so I need to make the top three.

307
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,275
Out of how many?

308
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,278
I think 150?

309
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:15,326
There aren't too many 21-year-olds
in competitions.

310
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,078
-You mean it's too old?
-Yeah.

311
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:22,083
By the time you're 21,
you either quit or you're already a pro.

312
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,380
So if I can't make it into the top three,

313
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,133
then I probably won't be able to
become a pro.

314
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,426
At least in my mind.

315
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,931
Then I guess your future depends
on what happens.

316
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,392
-Yeah, it will.
-I see.

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,520
SHIBUYA, TOKYO

318
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,523
HJ COMPANY LIMITED

00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,857
MISS HIGH SCHOOL JAPAN

320
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,653
Last time I mentioned about modeling
for the cover of <i>Gravure</i> magazine.

321
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,823
The cover of a shonen magazine...

322
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,783
KEITA MIYAGI
DIRECTOR, HIGH SCHOOL MODEL MAGAZINES

323
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,704
I think we talked about whether
that would be something you wanted to do.

324
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,998
Have you given it any thought?

325
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,878
I don't feel comfortable about
the fact that I'd be in a bathing suit.

326
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,757
-You must've been working really hard.
-Yes, well...

327
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:16,137
I can tell you've lost weight.

328
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,471
That's how I feel.

329
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,685
I do think this is a job that's necessary
to further your career.

330
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,312
It's my personal opinion that

331
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:29,233
you should take any job
that comes your way for now.

332
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:35,156
This is the first time
I'm actually conversing with you.

333
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,491
What's wrong?

334
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,494
-What's funny?
-What's wrong?

335
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,330
-Am I being weird?
-Yeah.

336
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,206
-No, it's normal.
-What's wrong?

337
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,418
-He's your type?
-No, no.

338
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,754
-Do I have a weird face?
-No, no, you don't.

339
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,671
Are you nervous?

340
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,175
Actually, I wanted to talk to Arman.

341
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,718
-Me?
-Yeah.

342
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,470
You know how we talked about going--
Oh, I'm sorry!

343
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,139
-It's okay. Would you prefer we left?
-No, it's okay.

344
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,265
-It's so serious.
-Sorry.

345
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,183
It's okay.

346
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,560
We talked about going to the beach,

347
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,397
but now I have practice on the weekends.

348
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,609
The show's going to run for a while.

349
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,779
And if I go before the performance,

350
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,867
I'll be thinking about it
and won't be able to have fun.

351
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,163
I totally understand. Good luck.
We can go after.

352
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,790
-After you're done.
-Yeah.

353
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,416
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,169
There's no need to apologize.

355
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,547
I won't know what to do if you apologize.

356
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,342
Please wait a little longer for me.

357
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,468
Sure.

358
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,470
See you tomorrow then.

359
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,055
-See ya.
-Yeah.

360
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,058
-Good night.
-Good night. I'm sorry.

361
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,147
I used to do performances, so I get it.

362
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,442
-It takes focus.
-Yeah.

363
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,736
If she makes a mistake,

364
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,280
I don't want her to regret
missing a practice.

365
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,990
So you understand.

366
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,042
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

367
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,629
-Ready?
-Ready.

368
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,881
Is it gonna rain today?

369
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,260
It's not raining right now,
but it might later.

370
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,722
It's starting to rain.

371
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,181
Oh, no!

372
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,058
How much longer is it?

373
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,643
Another hour.

374
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,062
Wake me up in 45 minutes.

375
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,605
What?

376
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,442
-You're going to sleep?
-Yeah.

377
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,484
You can sleep.

378
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,654
-No, I'm not going to.
-You can.

379
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,698
You're sleepy, right?
You can lean back.

380
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,782
It's okay.

381
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,743
Oh, I'll take a shot of Tokyo Tower.

382
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,164
-I'm like a tourist.
-You are like a tourist.

383
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,543
YOKOHAMA, KANAGAWA

384
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,461
CUPNOODLES MUSEUM

385
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,254
-Isn't it cool?
-Like Hansan said.

386
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,172
Yeah.

387
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,300
-What'd he say, that a designer built it?
-Yeah.

388
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,885
Someone famous.

389
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,559
-Are you good at drawing?
-No, I'm not.

390
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:19,153
When you're done drawing,
please head to the counter.

391
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,070
Okay.

392
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,531
I'll make one for you.

393
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,492
Then I'll do yours.

394
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,997
Is that okay?

395
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,874
ARMAN

396
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,083
-Looks good.
-Ready.

397
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,089
Please spin the handle six times.

398
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,426
Wow!

399
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,262
There it goes.

400
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,475
That's six. Thank you very much.

401
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,310
-Ding!
-Here are your noodles.

402
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,562
-It went "Ding!"
-Here you go.

403
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,524
-Which one do you want?
-You can pick for me.

404
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,567
The normal noodles please.

405
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,363
Cheddar cheese, egg and egg powder.

406
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,031
Nice and colorful.

407
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,410
Please move over to this side to wait.

408
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,797
-Thank you.
-Wait, that's only five.

409
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,633
Wait, what? No, there it is.

410
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,764
Entrance fee?

411
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,934
-Oh, wanna go to the kid's party?
-Yeah!

412
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:32,851
Really?

413
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,146
-I'm hungry.
-Doesn't this look cool? Wanna make one?

414
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,356
That's okay.

415
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,025
-Do you know what this is?
-I don't know.

416
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,736
It's a Thai taxi.

417
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,406
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

418
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,413
Oh, it's good.

419
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,248
Want to try some?

420
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,083
Yeah.

421
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,669
It's sweet.

422
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,462
Sweet and spicy.

423
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,223
-It's good.
-Yeah.

424
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,975
What are we doing after this?

425
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,603
How about the shopping center?

426
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:16,812
Okay.

427
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,190
How's the third date?

428
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,109
It's fun.

429
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,363
So for you,
is there a difference between...

430
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,576
a date when you're in a relationship
and one where you're not?

431
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,536
If I'm not in a relationship...

432
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,833
-then I don't want a date in yukatas.
-No?

433
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,918
If we weren't in a relationship.

434
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,922
-That's for when you're in a relationship?
-Yeah, and theme park dates, too.

435
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,091
But this is okay?

436
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,885
-Just barely.
-Just barely?

437
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,637
And?

438
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,643
If I'm not in a relationship with someone,
I wouldn't hold hands with him.

439
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,773
-You'd have to be in a relationship?
-Yeah, I wouldn't hold hands otherwise.

440
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,817
But maybe holding hands is normal?

441
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,486
I don't know.

442
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,364
I probably would,
even if we weren't in a relationship.

443
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,407
-You would?
-If I liked the person.

444
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,660
I see. If you liked her.

445
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,162
What about for you?

446
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,872
Is there a difference?

447
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,625
Something you're okay with
even if you're not in a relationship?

448
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,087
Even if I'm not in a relationship...

449
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:28,509
as long as we had feelings for each other,
I'd be okay with anything.

450
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:30,928
Anything?

451
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,513
-Anything.
-Anything?

452
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,307
I'd treat her like a girlfriend.
Are you drinking this?

453
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,102
I'd be okay treating her
like a girlfriend.

454
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:39,770
I would.

455
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,487
I see.

456
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,534
YOKOHAMA WORLD PORTERS

457
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,414
Is there anything you need to buy?

458
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,708
No, not really.

459
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,042
Me neither.

460
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,502
Shall we go then?

461
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,629
-Yeah.
-What?

462
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,090
-Should we go?
-Should we go?

463
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,927
-Should we go home?
-Should we?

464
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,595
-Should we?
-Should we?

465
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,513
Why?

466
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,729
I want to spend more time
in Yokohama sometime.

467
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
That's funny.

468
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,332
-What?
-The sign.

469
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,754
It said to move slowly,
both in cars and in love.

470
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,381
That is funny.

471
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,259
Why is it so funny?

472
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,307
Why are you so quiet?

473
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,641
I'm not.

474
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,478
-You are.
-Am I?

475
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,106
Maybe because I'm thinking.

476
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,441
About what?

477
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,860
What are you thinking about?

478
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,154
I was thinking I'd let you sleep
because you're sleepy.

479
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,947
-I'm not.
-No?

480
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,076
-Hold on.
-What's happening?

481
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,829
-What was that?
-Their last conversation about

482
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,334
how he's okay with anything
if he likes someone...

483
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,421
She was taken a little aback by that.

484
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,967
-Their paths missed each other there.
-Rikopin seemed to be holding off

485
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,471
from moving on to the next step
of the relationship.

486
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,307
At least it seemed that way.

487
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,310
She did say the museum just barely passed.

488
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,647
She said she could go there
even if they weren't in a relationship.

489
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,232
That must have been a shock to him.

490
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,276
But they're not in a relationship yet...

491
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,613
But they've been on several dates already.

492
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:59,910
If someone said that to me,
I'd think I'm only one step away.

493
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:04,748
I think I understand how Terashima feels.

494
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:10,671
-Why?
-Well, Riko is attracted to Byrnes.

495
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,883
Also, with it still raining
after a date like that,

496
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,051
I would feel like that too.

497
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,637
I see.

498
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,015
They both might be
reading into things too much.

499
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:26,436
It's not like Rikopin isn't having fun.

500
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,857
But Terashima is making assumptions
and reacting to them.

501
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,318
And Rikopin sees that
and asks why he's so quiet.

502
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,528
Just a small...

503
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,072
-A misunderstanding.
-Mutual.

504
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,910
They need a reminder
from that comedian Esper Ito.

505
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,288
Yeah, it's a little too serious right now.

506
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,915
They need bigger misunderstandings
and some more flailing.

507
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,044
They need to stuff themselves in a bag!

508
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,755
He should be in a bag in the girls' room.

509
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,674
And come out. Ta-da!

510
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,010
-That'd be scary.
-Yeah.

511
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,845
-She'd scream.
-Scream!

512
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,638
He'd be like, "Aw, Riko..."

513
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,227
There was one nice thing.

514
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,062
There's no more date with Arman.

515
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,399
-That's not nice.
-Why is that good?

516
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:16,987
It's like her teacher said,
the competition can determine her life.

517
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,155
She should take it seriously.

518
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,657
That's true. She's at a turning point.

519
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,950
She has to work hard.

520
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,203
If she wants to make it
to the top three out of 150...

521
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,456
-She has to do her best.
-Yeah, it'll be tough.

522
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,584
-I wonder what we'll get to see now.
-I wonder!

523
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,170
-Yeah, this is it for today.
-It feels dark.

524
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,880
There won't be a happy ending today,
that's for sure.

525
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,882
-I wonder!
-There's no way.

526
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,593
-Misunderstandings...
-What's gonna happen?

527
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,178
What's gonna happen?

528
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,058
Oh, Adidas.

529
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,018
It's been awhile since I've worn Adidas.

530
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,690
-It brings back memories.
-You're back early.

531
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,109
Is it? It's just past 7:00 p.m.

532
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,403
But you left in the afternoon.
I expected you back later.

533
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,321
-Really?
-Yeah.

534
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,324
The Cupnoodles Museum place was amazing.

535
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,618
Oh, the Cupnoodles Museum?

536
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,745
Yeah, that part was fun.

537
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,538
That part?

538
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,625
What does that mean?

539
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,211
On the way home...

540
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:19,007
he was really quiet.

541
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,467
-He was?
-Yeah.

542
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,052
Did you do something?

543
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,721
Did I?

544
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,767
Is there anything you can think of?

545
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,727
Well...

546
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,480
I did think we had differing views
on relationships.

547
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,941
-With Hayato?
-Yeah.

548
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:41,071
Our views on relationships
are total opposites.

549
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,407
Any progress?

550
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,995
For me, it's the third date...

551
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,038
-Already the third?
-Yeah.

552
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,417
I was planning on making a move.

553
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,713
But she doesn't even want to hold hands
if we're not in a relationship.

554
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,968
Theme park dates,
fireworks and yukata dates,

555
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,721
for her those are all things
she'd do with a boyfriend.

556
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,850
It's like she closed the door on me.

557
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,270
-She shut you down?
-Yeah, kind of.

558
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,565
We have differing views on relationships.

559
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,733
Yeah.

560
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,903
What should I do, Arman?

561
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,823
That's the problem. Not much you can do.

562
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,784
Not really. Is there nothing I can do?

563
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,998
If Rikopin got along with a girl,

564
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,043
she wouldn't say it out loud.

565
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,296
I wonder... But yeah, maybe.

566
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,632
So to Rikopin, you're a friend.

567
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,302
Probably.

568
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:51,099
Did anything change for you
after three dates?

569
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:56,396
I realize I like hanging out with him.

570
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,191
-Oh, good.
-He takes the lead.

571
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,819
He gets excited with me about stuff.

572
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,697
-Actually...
-He was more excited than you?

573
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,326
Yeah. Usually it's like, "Calm down."

574
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,579
There was nothing I didn't like, but...

575
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,834
I think there were things
that bothered him.

576
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:23,090
I think you guys should just get together.

577
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,634
Relationships are all about timing.

578
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,678
You're letting yourself miss it.

579
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:29,888
I see.
