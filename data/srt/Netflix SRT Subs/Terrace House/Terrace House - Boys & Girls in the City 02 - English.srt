1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,389
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,142
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,894
{\an8}<i>living together, and we observe</i>
<i>how they interact with each other.</i>

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,729
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

5
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,024
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,276
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,485
{\an8}That's right.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,533
So as of last week,
<i>Terrace House</i> began its new season.

9
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:33,617
Yes, yes.

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,869
Our location moved to Tokyo

11
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,622
where six new members moved in.

12
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,333
The first one was Makoto Hasegawa.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,876
{\an8}No one's here.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,463
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR AT MEIJI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,673
{\an8}Well...

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,342
{\an8}<i>He's on the university baseball team.</i>
<i>He's 21 years old.</i>

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,636
Oh, he's still on the team?
His elbow is injured.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,889
-Yes.
-He's a pitcher.

19
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,266
He seems popular among the girls.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,351
Yes, he does.

21
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,436
He seems to be a mighty man
with a tender heart.

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,521
And then we have Midori Nakada.

23
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:04,857
That's Minori Nakada.

24
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,070
That was close.

25
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,991
{\an8}-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,619
{\an8}-I am Makoto.
-I am Minori Nakada.

27
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,746
{\an8}<i>She's a model, and she's 21 years old.</i>

28
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,080
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

29
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,708
{\an8}-And then Yuki Adachi.
-There it is.

30
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,627
{\an8}Do you work?

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,920
{\an8}Work... I tap dance.

32
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,131
{\an8}I've been active as an instructor
and a performer.

33
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,799
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 27 YEARS OLD, TAP DANCER

34
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,384
{\an8}Amazing.
I've never met one before.

35
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,219
{\an8}-Please come see my performance.
-I will.

36
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,303
{\an8}My dancing is all right.

37
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,222
{\an8}<i>-A professional tap dancer.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

38
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,556
{\an8}He's 27 years old.

39
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,602
{\an8}He's the oldest out of all of them.

40
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,312
{\an8}And then Mizuki Shida.

41
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,025
{\an8}I'll be 23 soon.

42
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,359
{\an8}In clothing?

43
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,361
{\an8}No, it's a company related to soccer.

44
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,030
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD, OFFICE WORKER

45
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,324
{\an8}The president of the company runs
various enterprises,

46
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,702
{\an8}and one of them is a cafe.

47
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,247
{\an8}I also work as a barista there
twice a week.

48
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,540
Well, the barista here is 22--

49
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,000
Her name isn't "barista."

50
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
It's "Ms. Shida."

51
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,921
It sounds like a foreign baseball player.

52
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,423
Barista!

53
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,177
-Then Tatsuya Uchihara, the hair stylist.
-There he is.

54
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,512
{\an8}-Hello.
-Hello.

55
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,015
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD
HAIR STYLIST

56
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,350
{\an8}-He's holding something.
-It's a sewing machine.

57
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,978
{\an8}-I look forward to living with you.
-Likewise.

58
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,980
{\an8}I'm a hair stylist at Daikan-yama.

59
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,108
{\an8}Why the sewing machine?

60
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,485
{\an8}I've recently got into sewing.
So the machine is for clothes.

61
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,238
So he's pretty hip.
And he works at Daikan-yama.

62
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,990
Not a single bad trait.

63
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,160
But Mr. Tokui pointed out
his voice is a little high.

64
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,581
Yes, he's been rather active
with opening things up.

65
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,583
Yes, he's been asking
some pertinent questions.

66
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,961
Like, you're into this girl.

67
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,130
It would be Mizuki.

68
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,508
And finally, Yuriko Hayata,

69
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,052
a fourth-year med student.

70
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,262
Yes, that's right.

71
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,472
She'll be a doctor.

72
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,724
{\an8}I am Yuriko Hayata.
I'm 23 years old.

73
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,267
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD, MED STUDENT
4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

74
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,812
{\an8}What type of university?

75
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,689
{\an8}-It's a medical university.
-Wow.

76
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,983
{\an8}A doctor?

77
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,776
{\an8}Yes, I aspire to be one.

78
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,612
{\an8}You know girls with names like "Yuriko,"

79
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,281
where the Chinese character "Yu" is--

80
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,409
Like the famous lyricist.

81
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,831
I've been told to watch out for girls
with that character "Yu" in their name.

82
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,168
Something tells me
things will be tricky with her.

83
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,294
You think?

84
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,630
Things will move a bit this week.

85
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,716
People have stated their interests.
"Oh, I like her."

86
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,675
-Things should move.
-Yes.

87
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm off to practice.
-Makoto

88
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,685
She's coming?

89
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,187
What do you want to drink?

90
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,647
-Orange juice.
-Orange juice is fine?

91
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,357
I also want some cereal.

92
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,944
-Thank you for this meal.
-Thank you for this meal.

93
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,791
There she is.

94
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,085
-Good morning.
-Oh, hey...

95
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,878
Only the girls?

96
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:59,591
The only one left is Yuki.

97
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,928
-Thanks for the cereal.
-Anytime.

98
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,597
That's so difficult. What are your hours?

99
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,182
Usually until 7:00 p.m.

100
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,393
-Oh. 7:00 p.m.?
-10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.?

101
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,603
Yes.

102
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,355
It must be nice to have a day off.

103
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,234
You'll go into the pool today, right?

104
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,320
{\an8}TOKYO
DAIKAN-YAMA

105
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,449
What about the girls?

106
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,285
The girls are pretty cute.

107
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,287
He's laughing.

108
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,914
He's smiling.

109
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,124
I see.

110
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,458
{\an8}MIKI TAKEUCHI, DIRECTOR OF THE SALON

111
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,419
{\an8}-So is there someone you like?
-Well, we just started, so...

112
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,545
Yes, there is.

113
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,755
Just by looks?

114
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,134
Yes, just appearance.

115
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,676
It's still early.

116
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,637
We'll see what you say in a month.

117
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,723
I might start going out
with someone or something.

118
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,351
You should cut their hair for them.

119
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,478
And they will all like me.

120
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,689
I am greedy.

121
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,858
Yes, right this way, please.

122
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,198

I want to increase the exposure.

132
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,041
Will the athletes be there?

133
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,335
No, they won't.

I eat well when I do eat.

172
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,524
But, generally, I...

173
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,276
dance and then I eat a lot in the evening.

174
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,278
You're heavy if you eat too much?

175
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,779
I guess so.

176
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,531
Can I eat all of it?

177
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,408
Please.

178
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,834
So I'll tidy up.

179
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,918
Right.

180
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,505
Meanwhile, the women will get ready.

181
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,050
Please.

182
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,804
-Are you sure, it's okay?
-Of course.

183
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,389
Thank you.

184
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Then I'll go.

185
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,733
Okay.

186
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,488
-Are you curious?
-About what?

187
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,617
Tits?

188
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,743
Yeah.

189
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,288
I like asses more than tits.

190
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,998
-You like asses?
-Yes.

191
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,291
-Really.
-Yeah.

192
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,876
I like tits.

193
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,544
What kind of ass do you like?

194
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,629
Really perky.

195
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,758
It'll get all weird.

196
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,511
Then tell me which one you like,

197
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,389
-just quick so I can understand.
-Okay.

198
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,850
-I'll say the color of the bathing suit.
-Hey?

199
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,104
If it's blue, let's say like, "Cool!"

200
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,690
-I'll say, "Blue!"
-Blue!

201
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,325
It's hot.

202
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,956
You're good.

203
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
It's cold.

204
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,681
It's awesome.

205
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,522
Here they are.

206
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,732
We've been waiting.

207
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,783
It's fun already.

208
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,992
For sure.

209
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,537
I wonder if it's deep enough.

210
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,789
Should be okay.

211
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,709
It's cold.

212
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,835
Blue!

213
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,715
It's a nice blue.

214
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,676
It's cold.

215
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,844
The look on your face...

216
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,138
after you said, "Blue!"

217
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,100
It's cold.

218
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,519
-Lady in blue.
-Yes.

219
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,770
Here comes the sun.

220
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,855
It's out.

221
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah!

222
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,455
Look at this.

223
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,499
-Look at my hair.
-It looks like seaweed.

224
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,583
Look.

225
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,418
Woops.

226
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,587
Just great.

227
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,399

233
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,426
{\an8}We just hung out yesterday too.

234
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,554
{\an8}It's like we've got too much free time.

235
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,557
Things will resume next week.

236
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,310
Are you busy with school?

237
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,688
-I'm busy before tests.
-Do you have lots of tests?

238
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,691
I have one every month or so.

239
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,234
When are you busy?

240
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,113
I have my thesis,

241
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,908
so I will be busy with that soon.

242
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,827
So for your thesis,

243
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,244
do you research then write it?

244
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,623
I do experiments in the lab,
so I present the results.

245
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,124
What kind of experiments?

246
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,209
Fish experiments.

247
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,252
-Fish?
-Fish.

248
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,632
We keep a bunch of killifish at the lab.

249
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,344
And we make them learn to do things.

250
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,636
Like conditioning?

251
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,513
-Yes, yes!
-Yeah, I get it.

252
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,139
-That's what it is.
-I see.

253
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,600
You're the first person to get it.

254
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,812
Like if they do something, they get food?

255
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,230
Do you experiment on animals?

256
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,607
-What...
-Do you?

257
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,650
I've done dissections.

258
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,026
On mice?

259
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,778
Frogs and mice.

260
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,490
And humans.

261
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:50,663
I guess everyone does that in med school.

262
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,040
Yeah, I think so.

263
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,127
We're home!

264
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,294
Welcome back.

265
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,796
-What?
-It's hot.

266
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,673
-He's awake.
-Wait a minute.

267
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,758
Just the two of you?

268
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,175
-Just the two.
-Everyone's awake.

269
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,844
Happy?

270
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,679
I'm done for today.

271
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,723
I'm in a good mood.

272
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,891
-Is there a Minori bowl for me?
-Yes, there is.

273
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,017
I'm gonna eat.

274
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,310
-What's a Minori bowl?
-A Minori bowl.

275
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,981
Is Uchi asleep?

276
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,442
-I don't think he's home yet.
-He's not back?

277
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,527
It's late.

278
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,114
-What time is it?
-It's just before midnight.

279
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,699
Thank you for the meal.

280
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,870
-Yum!
-She's low on energy.

281
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,580
-Yeah, low on energy.
-Delicious!

282
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,751
Are you okay?
Are you really playing baseball?

283
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,878
I am.

284
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,631
It doesn't look like you're being careful.

285
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,216
-When you have the game...
-Do you even know the rules of baseball?

286
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,636
-I do.
-Oh, really?

287
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,888
I told you I was an assistant
for a baseball team.

288
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,932
Really? You can keep score?

289
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,058
Yes, I can.

290
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,310
Yeah. Do you need me to?

291
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,728
But you probably have one already.

292
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,979
Yes, we do.

293
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,567
-I think I'll go.
-It's not that we need...

294
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:06,322
It's different when someone
wants to do it out of kindness.

295
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,574
-No pressure.
-Hmm?

296
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,452
-No pressure.
-No pressure.

297
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,578
I'm off to bed.

298
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,038
-Good night.
-Good night. Sorry.

299
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,748
-It's okay.
-Good night.

300
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,459
Good night.

301
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,251
So you're rather familiar with baseball.

302
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,546
Yes, I am. That's why...

303
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,006
-I do still go to ball games.
-Really?

304
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,468
I went to boys' school.

305
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,927
I envied teams with girl assistants.

306
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,971
-Here, this is yours.
-By the way...

307
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,348
I don't know how to keep score.

308
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,391
Want me to teach you?

309
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,560
I'm not sure if I can remember exactly.

310
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,855
-I might have forgotten.
-Oh, I can't.

311
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,148
Check it out.

312
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,529
A game?

313
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,864
Really?

314
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,994
I am in my uniform.

315
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,746
-Are you there?
-Yes, I am.

316
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,999
-Furthest to the right?
-Yes.

317
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,586
I'm sure you're judging.
I'm not wearing any make-up.

318
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,926
-It says October 31st.
-Who did you lose to?

319
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,639
-Let's see. Ura-Gaku.
-Ura-Gaku? From Saitama?

320
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,390
-They're really good.
-Yes.

321
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,608
-Are you okay not sleeping?
-I guess I will go.

322
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,401
We can talk forever about this.

323
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,403
-Yeah.
-So we'll do this again.

324
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,867
Yeah, there's a good vibe there.

325
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,410
Yeah?

326
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,203
It's the late '90s...

327
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,873
-Yes, the late '90s.
-Kind of vibe.

328
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,127
It's like the post-trendy vibe
from the late '90s or something.

329
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,796
Just a bit.

330
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,006
-She said they could talk forever.
-Yes.

331
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,050
"So we'll do this again."

332
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,511
"Again."

333
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,179
That's the vibe from the late '90s?

334
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,723
Yes, where the woman is
a little tougher.

335
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,016
I see.

336
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,518
Do you think they'll hook up?

337
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,396
But didn't Tatsuya say who he's into?

338
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,898
-That's right.
-Yes.

339
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:09,278
Oh! He knows that his friend likes her.

340
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,697
Man, you really get it.

341
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,991
He totally remembered it.

342
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,410
Something we adults have forgotten.

343
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,663
He may be thinking of her
just as a friend.

344
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,667
I don't know. Friendships between
men and women don't really exist.

345
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,087
Are we in space?

346
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,173
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

347
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,968
Sorry.

348
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,721
Everyone probably thought,
"Who is he to know something like that?"

349
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,681
That's what that pause was.

350
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,975
That's why I had that choking feeling.

351
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,517
Just... "Ack!" You know...

352
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,271
By the way, Minori's <i>body.</i>

353
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,397
<i>Body?</i>

354
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,234
-It's spectacular.
-It really is.

355
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,570
The tap dancer might also have been
knocked out by that.

356
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,322
-I think Tap has.
-Yes,

357
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,617
Tap did seem to be in
a good mood at night.

358
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,327
-He must have danced hard that day.
-Tap?

359
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,248
Like, the others would notice,
"Hey, your tapping sounds chipper today.

360
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,292
-What happened?"
-"Oh, really?"

361
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,712
-"Hey, something sounds different."
-"I think you are in love."

362
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,380
By how he sounds!

363
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,465
Yes, all by his tap moves.

364
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,301
Like, "Hey, how's it going?"

365
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,888
Tap talk?

366
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,806
-Tap talk.
-Tap talk!

367
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,850
I want to see him talk with his tap moves.

368
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,102
"I like you."
And then...

369
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,146
"What?"

370
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,024
"I can't hear you."

371
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,901
By tap!

372
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,779
So trendy!

373
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,656
We've gone back to the '70s!

396
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,390
Step firmly.

397
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,353
The other side.

398
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,025
{\an8}Hey.

399
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,902
{\an8}-Hi.
-Oh, he's back.

400
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,363
-All done for the day?
-I've been home.

401
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
-I was in the bath.
-Oh, right.

402
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,241
Thank you.

403
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,245
-Is it done?
-Not yet.

404
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,163
A bit more.

405
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,165
Like a mom.

406
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,500
-What?
-Like a mom.

407
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,127
-Like a mom?
-A housemaster.

408
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,588
Hey, now that we're here,
let's figure out the birthday.

409
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,299
-It's almost his birthday.
-That's right.

410
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,803
What is everyone's schedule like?
Do you have something?

411
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,346
I'm off on the 19th.

412
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm working.

413
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,391
-That, I know.
-I'll go look.

414
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,768
I'm off the 18th.

415
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,604
That you can't change.

416
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,314
It's finally ready.

417
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,983
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thanks for the meal!

418
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,653
Delicious.

419
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,113
It's good.

420
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,157
-I'm glad.
-What was this again?

421
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,534
-Grilled fish?
-It's cod.

422
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,912
It's been a while
since I've had a meal like this.

423
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,998
-He can't do the 18th.
-No?

424
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,666
-So the 19th.
-The 19th.

425
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,501
What will we give him?

426
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,171
We don't know much about dance.

427
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,464
He said he wears his swim trunks
for his rehearsal.

428
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,425
What kind of swim trunk was he wearing?

429
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,969
-A fish pattern.
-Fish?

430
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,263
-Were they green?
-No.

431
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,432
-Not that?
-White and blue.

432
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,851
As expected, you are observing well.

433
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,686
You too are buddies.

434
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,522
-What color does he like?
-Stop teasing me.

435
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,692
I wonder what would be good.

436
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,404
-If you said, "Yuri picked it for you..."
-Then he would wear it.

437
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,074
He would be happy for sure.

438
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,202
-Maybe Minori could pick.
-You just need someone cute.

439
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,411
No, not me.

440
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,332
Girls often have
this issue of being too modest.

441
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,876
-Definitely.
-It's not good.

442
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,838
-You think you're pretty cool, huh?
-I do.

443
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,005
Yes, I do.

444
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,676
-That was good.
-I'm full.

445
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,761
-I'm full. Thanks for the meal.
-Thanks for the meal.

446
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,430
-Thanks for the meal.
-So, for now,

447
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,307
as a plan,

448
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,809
we'll go with that.

449
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,982
I'm gonna go do my laundry.

450
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,149
I'll...

451
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,235
You do it every day.
Teach me.

452
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,361
Sure.

453
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,949
You do a lot of laundry, Makocchan.

454
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,284
Yes, I have a lot.

455
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,870
Do you wash your practice uniform by hand?

456
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,997
-Or throw them in a machine?
-Yes, I throw them in.

457
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,748
When I was in the laundry room,

458
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,791
there were two big piles.

459
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,961
That's before the wash, right?

460
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,545
-That's done.
-Those were washed?

461
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,673
-Where do you dry it?
-It was really smelly.

462
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,425
-She said it was smelly.
-It was stinky.

463
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,635
No, really?

464
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,096
-It was really smelly.
-That's trouble.

465
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,890
I'm screwed.

466
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,182
Oh, you're done.

467
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,768
I didn't say it.

468
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,353
Oh, you did.

469
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,646
"It's smelly."

470
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,482
-I did.
-Yes, Yuri said it, too.

471
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,741
-The women on the right and the men, left.
-Ah, that's the rule?

472
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,286
-But I am using both machines.
-Oh, that's fine.

473
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,455
Let's see.

474
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,873
-This one?
-Yes.

475
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,252
Phew.

476
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,047
Which do you put in?

477
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,467
He knows what he's doing.

478
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,885
-He's good.
-And?

479
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,262
-Start?
-Yes.

480
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,934
-Yes.
-Okay.

481
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,817
Everyone seems decent at cooking.

482
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,945
Mizuki's pretty good.

483
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,780
Is it that thing?
It's about being modest at first.

484
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,700
-Why?
-At first you said you couldn't cook.

485
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,454
Well, just not good enough
to treat other people.

486
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,830
-I see.
-Yeah.

487
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,748
I wonder why...

488
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,918
women are so modest.

489
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,339
When I say that someone's cute,

490
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,091
they all squeal or make a fuss...

491
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,970
then praise each other.

492
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,138
Well, that's all we can do about it.

493
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,224
Why, isn't it about
whether you really are cute or not?

494
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,227
It depends how well we know each other.
So if we are close,

495
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,187
we can say, "That's not cute."

496
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,274
-But if not, we say, "Oh, that's cute."
-You say that?

497
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,485
That's harsh.

498
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,573
It's cool in here.

499
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,827
So?

500
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,122
What do you mean?

501
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,332
-What is it?
-Oh, you know.

502
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,417
-Like, what? Really.
-How is it?

503
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,837
-Nothing yet.
-No?

504
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,132
-Just checking it out.
-Right.

505
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,217
Things have changed since the beginning.

506
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,219
-It's changing?
-Yeah.

507
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,637
Really?

508
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,098
Such as?

509
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,142
Unexpectedly, actually.

510
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,811
-Like, Yuriko was around here.
-Yeah.

511
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,397
But now she's going off like so.

512
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,316
She's come a long way.

513
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,404
Don't you have feelings like that?

514
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,365
-No?
-Not yet.

515
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,824
-Not yet.
-It hasn't been a week yet.

516
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,702
It hasn't been a week yet,
but you can kind of see.

517
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,291
-Their silhouettes are starting to show.
-Yes, slowly.

518
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,169
-We start from here.
-From here.

519
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,713
That's the most romantic
laundry room ever.

520
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,091
That's true.

521
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,802
Yes, two washing machines in the dark.

522
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,012
He was saying something there.
You know...

523
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,764
Yes, about Yuriko.

524
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,058
Yes, Tatsuya did.

525
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:21,478
Yes, he's someone who rates people.

526
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,649
The typical attitude
of a handsome guy is coming out.

527
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,195
But he also works hard.

528
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,612
It's attractive.

529
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,074
Although, the client would be thinking,

530
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,991
"He's attractive,
but his voice is too high."

531
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,412
"I have a bad feeling.

532
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,373
It's just, a little too high.
I have a bad feeling."

533
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,834
"I have a bad feeling.
It's too high."

534
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,920
Why make it sound like a ghost tale?

535
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,006
{\an8}Yeah, why do we mimic Junji Inagawa?

536
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,383
{\an8}JUNJI INAGAWA

537
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,051
{\an8}"There's something strange.

538
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,636
{\an8}He's tall and good looking.

539
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,098
{\an8}But I have a bad feeling.

540
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,641
{\an8}I just can't place it.
His voice is too high."

541
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,230
What about the cooking?

542
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:08,150
They don't really know each other, there,

543
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,695
and then the barista makes that fish meal.

544
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:18,535
That, for you, is a bit too early
to make that kind of meal?

545
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,373
Well, from a guy's perspective,

546
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,458
that comes off as a really good quality.

547
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,336
It's not excessively fancy.

548
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,422
But it was a simple way of saying,

549
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,424
"I can cook."

550
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,429
Also, to tell you the truth,
cooking with foil is super easy.

551
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:41,183
-You don't need to do much.
-Oh, really.

552
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,268
I think she knows that.

553
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,020
-I see.
-I think she's brilliant.

554
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,151
Even for the women,
it's not something extravagant.

555
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,235
-Right? The best choice.
-Yes.

556
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,486
So for women,

557
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,406
there is a dish that is extravagant?

558
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,199
A quiche.

559
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,124
{\an8}Just now...

560
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,504
{\an8}when I put on my pajamas, Yuri said,

561
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,299
-"Is that from soccer?"
-Which?

562
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,091
-Lakers.
-That's basketball, right?

563
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,343
-Basketball.
-You know that?

564
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,470
-Duh! Really?
-It says "Basketball" on it.

565
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,181
I saw it from far away.

566
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,559
Then she said,
"Aren't basketball players kind of cool?"

567
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,768
Yeah.

568
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,145
Aren't basketball players the coolest?

569
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,980
-I think soccer.
-Soccer?

570
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,816
Okay, here we go.

571
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,901
-This is Monk Grab?
-Yes, Monk Grab.

572
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,620
So you like boys who play basketball?

573
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,705
Boys in the basketball team--

574
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,626
I had to think!

575
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,545
Were you dating someone
from a basketball team?

576
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,423
I had feelings for this one
since elementary school.

577
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,799
In high school,

578
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,676
it's pretty important
which group you're in.

579
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,969
What kind of guys did you date?

580
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,637
Soccer players, the whole three years.

581
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,847
-Oh, really?
-Me, too.

582
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,182
-The soccer team?
-Soccer's cool, yeah?

583
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,852
-What club was Uchi in, you think?
-I think he said soccer.

584
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,187
He seems like a soccer guy.

585
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,733
He seems comfortable with women.

586
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,862
Let's play President.
Something we can play slowly.

587
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,989
What were we talking about?
Oh, right, from this.

588
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,199
-So what's your type?
-Right, from the Lakers.

589
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,410
Just like I said before.

590
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,162
-Tall.
-Yes. And calm.

591
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,707
-And calm.
-You know, people that are calm...

592
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,836
Well, there are only three of them.

593
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,338
Which one would it be?

594
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,674
I guess Makocchan seems calm.

595
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,759
Right.

596
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,011
If you're thinking about marriage,

597
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,805
you can't just casually date anymore.

598
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,807
-Anymore?
-Yes.

599
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,935
Even more so
if you're already in the work force.

600
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,855
You don't think about it?
Don't you think about getting married?

601
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,483
-I want to get married already.
-Already?

602
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,194
-Well, I'm in my fourth year.
-Oh, right.

603
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,364
I guess after graduation.

604
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,784
Well, if you want marriage to happen then,
you've got to start dating now.

605
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,537
What type were you into again, Yuri?

606
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,455
-Out of the three of them?
-Yeah.

607
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,667
-Makocchan.
-He's number one?

608
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,670
Right.
But isn't that the same with everyone?

609
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,548
-Makocchan has two votes.
-He's easy to like.

610
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,301
His general vibe is nice.

611
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,135
Makocchan?

612
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,055
He got all three votes.

613
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,725
-Wait, so we're all into him?
-I am surprised.
