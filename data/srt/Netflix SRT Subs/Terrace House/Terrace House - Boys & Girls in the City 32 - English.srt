1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:17,476
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,021
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,860
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,237
Last week...

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,492
Misaki confessed her feelings to Hikaru,
but was rejected.

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,495
I feel like you don't know yourself.

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,704
You're insecure.

10
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,792
And it's those core elements to you
which I don't really like.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,295
-And that night...
-Yes, the incident that night.

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,050
The rejection was completely overshadowed
by the incident.

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,471
Natsumi became infuriated
when Misaki said she reeked of alcohol.

14
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,641
I don't understand that explanation.

15
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,102
You're a little drunk, aren't you?

16
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,229
You totally reek of alcohol.

17
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,025
I can't help it!

18
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,571
I couldn't wait otherwise!
Seriously, what time is it?

19
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,614
-I'm sorry.
-It's 1:00 in the morning.

20
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:17,869
Then she started saying she didn't want
to be labeled as a drinker.

21
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:23,250
She doesn't want to be thought that way
because it might affect her career.

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,920
Natsumi can't seem
to control her emotions.

23
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,799
We found Fuyumi, the evil Natsumi,
inside her.

24
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,468
-Yes, her alter ego.
-She comes out at times.

25
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,096
She doesn't want to seem like a drunk
in front of her fans?

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,057
Well, she is an actress.

27
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,476
So she doesn't want
that image attached to her name.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,603
Isn't the association with Fuyumi worse?

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,523
-That's true.
-Yes.

30
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,318
-You're right.
-Yeah, Fuyumi seems worse.

31
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:55,324
After that,
they had a serious house meeting.

32
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,452
I've been trying to change.

33
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,038
But it's hard to change.

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,584
Natsumi then announced
that she'll be leaving <i>Terrace House</i>.

35
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,586
I think I've figured out...

36
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,631
what I've been missing.

37
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,176
-And during the barbecue...
-That's right.

38
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,094
-Hikaru...
-Hikaru, too.

39
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,181
I'm... leaving <i>Terrace House</i>.

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,266
-What?
-Really.

41
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,517
-Seriously?
-I'm serious.

42
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,394
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

43
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,896
<i>-So two members will be leaving.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,272
-Also...
-Yes?

45
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,734
<i>Terrace House </i>has been<i> </i>extended again.

46
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,985
Yay!

47
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,656
It was supposed to end after week 36,

48
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,325
but ten weeks have been added,
so there will be 46 weeks.

49
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,954
Oh, ten weeks?
Shouldn't the show just go indefinitely?

50
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,123
It'll air until August for now.

51
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,627
Life at <i>Terrace House</i> will continue
until the end of summer.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,795
I see.

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,341
When the show is close to ending,
wanna go beg them not to end it?

54
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,844
-"Please continue the show!" Like that?
-Yeah, like, "Please!"

55
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,806
-Seriously.
-Really?

56
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,767
-For real.
-When did you decide?

57
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,102
Um...

58
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,438
a while ago.

59
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,524
I still can't believe it.

60
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,238
I hate to add more bad news, but...

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,489
I'm leaving too.

62
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,658
-What?
-Tomorrow.

63
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,035
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

64
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,455
Seriously?

65
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,750
This is... What?

66
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,509
I'm so surprised to hear
you're leaving too, Hikaru.

67
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,015
It's too sudden. I thought I knew
everything going on with you.

68
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,228
I thought for sure
you'd tell me something like that.

69
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,190
I didn't tell you
because I thought I could just leave.

70
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,152
I thought it would be easier.

71
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,571
Why are you leaving?

72
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,283
My reason for moving in
was just to have a new experience.

73
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,285
I just wanted a different experience.

74
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,747
I feel like I experienced a lot...

75
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,167
and I learned a lot.

76
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,336
So I feel like I need to be
on my own now...

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,839
and work on my modeling
and acting careers.

78
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,967
I want to work on those.

79
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,182
So let's drink tonight.

80
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,351
Let's drink.

81
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,730
-Oh man...
-You're leaving tomorrow, too?

82
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,398
Yeah.

83
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,193
I took your being around for granted.

84
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,872
There's so much more
I wanted to do with you.

85
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,294
It's not like we can't see each other.

86
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,176
-It's not the same.
-It's really not.

87
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,844
It's totally different.

88
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,728
Let's have a good time
while you're still here.

89
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,356
Man...

90
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,406
This is the saddest I've felt here.

91
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,760

97
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,620
-Just the dishes.
-Don't clean up.

98
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,998
-We'll do it tomorrow.
-Stay, stay.

99
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,125
-Come on, drink up.
-You're always doing that, Nacchan.

100
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,418
Don't worry about it today.

101
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,046
-Yeah, Natsumi. Arman will do it.
-I'll do it.

102
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,257
-I'll do it.
-I'll do it.

103
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,009
-I'll do it!
-I'll do it!

104
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,635
Stop, Nacchan.

105
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,180
-Let's do it together.
-No, you sit.

106
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,893
-Maybe you should go to bed, Misaki.
-I'm not going to sleep!

107
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,437
Are you sure you're okay, Misaki?

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,481
I feel like you're gonna break something,
so you should just drink.

109
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,816
-You're already drunk.
-I'm not!

110
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,652
You are. You definitely are.

111
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,655
-You're drunk. Totally drunk.
-I'm not!

112
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,786
Let's hang out after you leave.

113
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,500
But seriously, you made me happy.

114
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,085
About what?

115
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,963
-You were right.
-About what?

116
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,674
When I confessed my feelings to you...

117
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:10,388
you said that I didn't really know myself
and that I was insecure.

118
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,515
I was really bitter about that.

119
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,728
Like, "What do you know about me?"

120
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,856
But I think you're right.

121
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,362
I'm glad that I fell for you.

122
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,034
Even though you annoyed me a lot, too!

123
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,245
Words from the person you like,

124
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,248
whatever they may be...

125
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,960
really affect you.

126
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,504
-Oh, am I being criticized?
-Yeah.

127
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,424
So that's why, in the future...

128
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:52,013
when you meet someone you like...

129
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,557
-you should be keep that in mind.
-Okay.

130
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,184
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
Let's both do our best.

132
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,441
-Yeah, do your best.
-I will.

133
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,406
Next time we meet, you'll be like,
"Wow, you've changed Misaki."

134
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,367
Yeah, I'll be looking forward to it.

135
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,077
I'll work on it.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,746
You don't have to change too much.

137
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,874
I do like this part of you.

138
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,544
Thank you.

139
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,467
-I think Arman feels the saddest.
-Yeah.

140
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,470
You should talk to him.

141
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,892
-I'll get him.
-No, it's okay.

142
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,771
Don't! It's okay.

143
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,982
Seriously, I don't get it.

144
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,195
Arman! Your turn to talk to him now.

145
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,448
It's not like he's my girlfriend.

146
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,826
-What'd she say?
-I don't know.

147
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,619
-It's not anything.
-What's wrong?

148
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,956
I just said I was sad about leaving you,
and she said we should talk.

149
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,625
She acted on her own.

150
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,170
Isn't this kind of weird?

151
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,172
-Don't be embarrassed.
-Embarrassed?

152
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,759
Man, what's she looking at?

153
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,929
I'm glad we got to do this at the end.

154
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,268
Thanks, Arman. Seriously.

155
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,395
-Seriously, thanks.
-No. Thank <i>you</i>.

156
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm the older one,
but I couldn't have done anything for you.

157
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,032
I'm the one who should thank you.

158
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,202
You really have it together.

159
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,371
-You can do anything.
-I still have a ways to go.

160
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,333
-Really.
-Thanks.

161
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,670
I wish we could've used the pool.

162
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,217
We'll have to go to the beaches
in Brazil or Hawaii next time.

163
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,636
I'm seriously going to visit you
in Hawaii.

164
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,849
-Shall we go in?
-Yeah.

165
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,316
That was unnecessary, but thanks.

166
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,116
-Bye.
-Bye.

167
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,408
-See you.
-You too, Tamochan.

168
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,996
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

169
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,415
Bye, Arman.

170
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,213
Nacchan, thank you.

171
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,925
See you. Thanks.

172
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,052
-Come visit.
-Yeah.

173
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,220
Hansan.

174
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,849
-Be well. Good luck.
-Thank you.

175
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,351
You too, Hikaru.

176
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,353
I'm leaving with you, though.

177
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,361
Bye.

178
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,032
-Seriously, thank you.
-Bye!

179
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:09,043
YOTSUKAIDO, CHIBA

180
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,130
KAORI BALLET STUDIO

181
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,718
Okay.

182
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,307
Make it big.

183
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,184
Yes, and jump.

184
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,195
-Thank you.
-Good job, Momochan.

185
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,867
I'm going to move
into <i>Terrace House</i> tomorrow.

186
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,452
-You're moving tomorrow?
-Yes.

187
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,831
For someone my age,
the fact that boys will be there

188
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,543
-is a little worrisome.
-Yes.

189
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:55,924
I've danced with men in a pas de deux...

190
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,468
but that's about it...

191
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,262
-You've had no exposure whatsoever.
-Yes.

192
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,600
-I'm very nervous.
-I'm sure you are.

193
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:11,522
GAIENMAE, TOKYO

194
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,025
You know how
I was talking about <i>Terrace House </i>?

195
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,277
-It's been confirmed.
-Seriously?

196
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,030
Living with a lot of people will be tough.

197
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,281
Yes.

198
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,076
-Lucky you.
-Lucky?

199
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,036
If I were younger, I'd do it too.

200
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,537
Your cooking tastes better
when you're in love.

201
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,873
-Is that true?
-Yeah, of course.

202
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>Terrace House </i>has a huge kitchen.

203
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,254
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

204
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,547
Great. That means you can cook.

205
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:40,093
-I'd like to cook for everyone.
-Nice.

206
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,179
-It's ready.
-Good. Bring it over and let's eat.

207
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,391
Okay.

208
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,686
New members!

209
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,940
Did our mood change too quickly?

210
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,362
-Each of us has an evil Fuyumi side, too.
-Yes.

211
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:05,201
Last night,
the way Tamosan acted in front of Hikaru?

212
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,328
-That was really great.
-It was.

213
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,539
It's amazing.
How did she do it?

214
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,666
She was so honest.

215
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,129
"I'm going to work hard to change.
When we meet again, you'll be surprised."

216
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,466
It's not easy to say something like that.

217
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,468
When a girl says it like that,

218
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:27,056
it makes a guy think
that she's a classy girl.

219
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,978
If things are going to end,
we should all end them like that.

220
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,523
We should!

221
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,442
-If it's going to end anyway.
-Right?

222
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,068
It should end that way.

223
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:44,615
A bad example, though,
is when a girl brings it to that point,

224
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,994
and when the guy says,
"I like that part of you,"

225
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,623
the girl, swept by the mood,
could say she likes him again.

226
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,377
If she does that,
he'd have to reject her again,

227
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,255
and things would end awkwardly.

228
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,342
But instead, Misaki called Arman
and ended the conversation.

229
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,428
That was a good moment to end it.

230
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,514
I see. She gains some points there.

231
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,767
-She did good.
-She did.

232
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
She did good.

233
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,980
-And now we have a ballerina.
-Yes, a ballerina.

234
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,274
And she seems especially sheltered.

235
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,943
It sounds like
she's never really gone out with a guy.

236
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,070
Maybe she's a little prudish.

237
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,988
"I've only danced with a man
in a pas de deux."

238
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,531
When can you say something like that?

239
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,493
"I've only been with a man
in a pas de deux."

240
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,661
I don't think I've ever used that word.

241
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,123
Pas de deux is when
a man and a woman dance as a pair, right?

242
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,125
I'm getting some signals from the chef.

243
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,711
-Seems like he'd be popular.
-I have a feeling he's a hottie.

244
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,052
Feels different
when it's just the four of us.

245
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,721
-It's quiet.
-Yeah.

246
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,559
-It's lonely.
-Yeah.

247
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,520
Oh, it's Rikopin.

248
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,898
-Come take a seat, Riko.
-Okay.

249
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,990
Can you cook, Riko?

250
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,744
-I can't.
-You can't? Well, we can work on it.

251
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,872
-It's my turn to cook on Monday.
-Oh, that's right.

252
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,292
-You cook well.
-I made yesterday's.

253
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,754
-It's Misaki's turn next.
-I'm scared.

254
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,005
It's delicious.

255
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,133
I heard her hamburger was really tough.

256
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,602
-Maybe I'll go to sleep.
-What?

257
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,315
Oh, my nose is running.

258
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,942
-Seriously?
-Let's go, Hansan.

259
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,527
Ding-dong.

260
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,612
-Oh, man!
-The doorbell rang.

261
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,156
Yes, the doorbell.

262
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,158
Uh, oh...

263
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,619
-Yes?
-I'm moving in today.

264
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,496
It's a girl.

265
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,998
Come in.

266
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,808
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

267
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,937
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Momoka Mitsunaga.

268
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,940
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

269
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,526
-Your head is tiny!
-Excuse me.

270
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,820
-Your head is really small.
-It is.

271
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,865
-I feel like I can grab it.
-Like you can grab it? What?

272
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,368
Yeah, like I can grab it.

273
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,079
-What was your name again?
-I'm Momoka Mitsunaga.

274
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,832
-So, Momochan?
-It's Momoka, but yes.

275
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,667
-How old are you?
-I'm 20.

276
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,463
-You seem older.
-Yeah.

277
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,089
Really?

278
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,257
Yay!

279
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,092
What do you do?

280
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,470
I'm a ballerina.

281
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,514
-This?
-Yes, that.

282
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,308
I'm trying to make it my profession.

283
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,728
I'm currently
at a professional training facility,

284
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,398
-and practicing in order to move up.
-Wow.

285
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,025
MOMOKA MITSUNAGA, 20 YEARS OLD,
BALLERINA

286
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,360
No wonder your posture's so straight.

287
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,947
-Is it? It's out of habit.
-Very ballerina-like.

288
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,743
-Amazing. Where are you from?
-I'm from Chiba,

289
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,247
but I spent five years
in Kyoto for ballet.

290
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:24,627
-Wow.
-And I just came back this April.

291
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,713
What about college?

292
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,717
No, I dance from morning to night.

293
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,639
-It's the first time we've had an athlete.
-Oh, that's right.

294
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,433
When did you start ballet?

295
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,854
I started gymnastics when I was three
and ballet at five.

296
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,525
A long time. About 15 years.

297
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,152
Do you have a boyfriend?

298
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:56,033
No, not for a while now.
It's been one, maybe two years.

299
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,702
Do you drink at all?

300
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,579
-I'm very weak.
-You are?

301
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,331
One drink is my limit.

302
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,086
-But generally--
-What?

303
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,671
It's the guy.

304
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,215
The girls should greet him.

305
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,259
-Can I go too?
-Of course.

306
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,261
Go, go.

307
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,224
It's my first time doing this.

308
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,936
-Yes?
-I'm moving in today.

309
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,314
-Please come in.
-Don't make a move on the new girl.

310
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,234
No, I won't. It's you.
She looks like someone you'd like.

311
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,069
Yeah, she looks cute.

312
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,788
-This is very nerve-wracking.
-It is.

313
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,168
-Hello.
-Come in.

314
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,045
It's nice to meet you.

315
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,630
Nice to meet you.
Can I put my luggage here?

316
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,714
Of course.

317
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,759
Please.

318
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,385
I'm Hayato Terashima.

319
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,970
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

320
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,640
-You're very tall.
-I'm 178 cm.

321
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,268
-Do you mind if I sit?
-Please.

322
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,145
-How old are you?
-I'm 29.

323
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,355
Twenty-nine?

324
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,023
-Older than me.
-Wow!

325
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,733
You seem younger.

326
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,528
-What do you do?
-I'm training to be a chef.

327
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,655
Wow!

328
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,658
Last night, we talked about
who might be coming,

329
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,911
and we said maybe a chef.

330
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,162
Really?

331
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,706
-What type of cuisine?
-Italian.

332
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,750
-Italian?
-Wow.

333
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,835
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-No.

334
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,838
-Since when?
-It's been about a year.

335
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,383
It's been awhile.

336
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,469
Are there any couples here?

337
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,472
-No, no one.
-No one.

338
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,934
So cupid's arrow might be pointing
in specific directions already?

339
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,354
-What, now? You think?
-Don't you think?

340
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,940
What do you think, Momochan?

341
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,360
-You move quick.
-You're so quick.

342
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,196
-Did I jump the gun?
-He seems like a player.

343
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,782
He's definitely a player.

344
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,493
We bought drinks.
Shall we have some?

345
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,787
Yes, let's!
Are you okay?

346
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,330
-I'm fine. I'm used to it.
-Used to it?

347
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,082
She usually drinks water.

348
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,003
Welcome to <i>Terrace House</i>. Cheers!

349
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,630
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

350
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,466
-Cheers!
-Nice to meet you.

351
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,685
So you're not a model or anything?

352
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,438
I was an aspiring actor.

353
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,816
I intended on pursuing it until I was 30,
but my plans changed.

354
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,571
I've been cooking part-time for a while,
so I thought I'd become a chef.

355
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,700
I also work part-time
at Lindt in Omotesando.

356
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,161
Have you heard of Lindor chocolates?

357
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,788
-They have one in Shibuya too?
-Oh, yes.

358
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,790
-I know it.
-It's the chocolate shop.

359
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,042
-I work there.
-How stylish.

360
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,212
-Do you make it?
-No, I just greet people.

361
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,007
Seems like you could teach ballet.

362
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,217
-I did in Kyoto.
-Kyoto?

363
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,889
I'll start teaching here this Saturday.

364
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,724
-An instructor then.
-Yes.

365
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,058
Instructor Momochan.

366
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,769
Wow.

367
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,479
-So mature.
-Yeah.

368
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,815
She must come from a good family.

369
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,152
Learning ballet seems really expensive.

370
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,946
Yes, it is.

371
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,743
Pointe shoes can be expensive.

372
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,453
Are they?

373
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,873
They get destroyed in about two weeks.

374
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,918
-One pair costs about 10,000 yen.
-Whoa!

375
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,754
What do you do with the shoes after?

376
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,048
-You throw them out?
-Yeah, to the garbage bin.

377
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,676
Did we ask?
What type of girl do you like?

378
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,220
No, we haven't yet.

379
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,890
Someone pure.

380
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,519
She should be active
and relatively social.

381
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,979
Something along those lines.

382
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,482
And you Momosan?

383
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,651
Someone who...

384
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,196
you can't grasp what he's really thinking.

385
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,741
-Mysterious?
-Yes, it makes me want to know him.

386
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:11,038
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I often tend to get that.

387
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,208
So, what do you think?

388
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,753
What about age difference?
You're okay with that?

389
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,130
I like older men.

390
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,341
How many women have you dated?

391
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,136
I've had about four relationships.
Yeah, four.

392
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,514
But he seems experienced with women.

393
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:34,311
I have a twin sister.
She's the older one.

394
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,774
So she had her girlfriends over
at the house all the time.

395
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,901
So maybe I'm experienced in that sense.

396
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,488
-I see.
-I grew up like that.

397
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,866
I think there are lots of pretty women
from Hokkaido.

398
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,329
That's true, there is that impression.

399
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,834
I often hear that people who work as cooks
don't like cooking at home.

400
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,670
I'm sure the girls would love to learn.

401
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,381
Cooking? I think I would like that.

402
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,091
Does anyone cook?

403
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,677
-Nobody.
-Do you?

404
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,806
I lived alone, so I can cook a little.

405
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,393
If you don't mind, we look forward to it.

406
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,270
For me to cook for everyone?

407
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,189
-That makes me nervous.
-Thank you very much.

408
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,776
-Here they are.
-Momochan is cute.

409
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,029
I mean, her name is Momoka Mitsunaga.

410
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,824
-So cute.
-She seems so pure.

411
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,660
-She's got a nice figure.
-Her posture...

412
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,581
I thought a ballerina would be super thin.

413
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,499
But she isn't too thin.

414
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:43,380
And her chest,
the stripes were stretched just right.

415
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:47,009
-It's perfect.
-Yes, very nice. Very nice.

416
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,470
-Um...
-Yes?

417
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,014
This whole time...

418
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,851
I've felt unsettled since I saw the chef.
Is it just me?

419
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,270
He looks like he's full of cilantro.

420
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,193
People who like it, like it.

421
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,531
He's got a really strong gaze.

422
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,701
It's just like Esper Ito
after his punchline.

423
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,079
"Ta-da!"

424
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,916
That's right!

425
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,835
At 29, he's an adult,
so maybe he felt like

426
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,674
-he needed to talk to lighten the mood.
-Trying to be social.

427
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,259
It would be hilarious
if his cooking was terrible.

428
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,762
They'd all whisper about it
behind his back.

429
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,515
"Does this taste kind of bad?"

430
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,435
But when he serves it,
he'd be like, "Ta-da!"

431
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,603
"Ta-da!"

432
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,733
Something could happen
between Hansan and Momoka.

433
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,946
Maybe.

434
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,824
Like, Momochan could fall for him.

435
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,827
-For the first time.
-Yes, she could fall for the first time.

436
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,663
A passionate <i>un, deux, trois</i>?

437
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,665
-A pas de deux?
-Yes.

438
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,126
"Will you dance a pas de deux with me?"

439
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,754
"I can't dance a pas de deux with you!"

440
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,131
"What?"

441
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,716
And the pointe shoes fall.

442
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,926
"Ta-da!"

443
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,804
Seriously?

444
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,015
"Don't come this way!"

445
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,351
But he'll pop out from the pointe shoes.

446
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,273
-Oh, man.
-You must be exhausted.

447
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,569
-I am. It's this strange--
-But you don't seem nervous.

448
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,988
I am, though.

449
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,073
I'm looking forward
to tasting your cooking.

450
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,909
What is your restaurant like?

451
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:40,122
The owner-chef was
in Italy for eight years.

452
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,416
-It's a really small place.
-Really?

453
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:47,129
It maybe fits 20.
About four to five tables.

454
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,299
How many people work in the kitchen?

455
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:56,263
Just the owner-chef, and I assist him,
and there's also a server.

456
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,266
So three in total.

457
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,642
-I want to go.
-It seems intense.

458
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,561
-That makes me want to go.
-Yeah.

459
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,729
Yeah, whenever.

460
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,565
-What do you think of the house?
-It's nice.

461
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,817
-What kind of girl did you say you liked?
-Pure.

462
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,570
So that's her personality.

463
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,491
-But guys tend to factor looks, too.
-You mean physically?

464
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,410
I like a balanced figure.

465
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,289
Momochan seems to fit
with her small head.

466
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:26,293
I'm not sure if I felt it with Momochan.
The way she looked at me...

467
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,880
We're both new, so maybe it was nerves.

468
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,965
Out of curiosity...

469
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:37,221
-what did you think of the new guy?
-He seems like he'd be your type, Riko.

470
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:42,643
He's good-looking, but he's 29.

471
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:47,648
-And his flirtiness...
-He seems like a player.

472
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,151
-But he is good-looking.
-Yeah.

473
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,154
I went to an all-girls high school.

474
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:59,368
-Oh, I see.
-So I'm not sure how to act around men.

475
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,580
Do you get nervous
when you talk with guys?

476
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,167
-If it was just the two of us, then...
-You'd get nervous?

477
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,837
Even if it's not a guy you like?

478
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,048
I've never even been on a date before.

479
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,010
I'd get really nervous.

480
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,265
-What did you think of Momochan, Arman?
-Yeah.

481
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,350
I think she's cute.

482
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,354
-She's in your strike zone?
-She's active and dances ballet.

483
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:32,276
I tend to like girls
who take care of their bodies.

484
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,736
-Nice.
-Arman.

485
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,864
We've never had an athlete before.

486
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,199
-That's true.
-So good first impression.

487
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,951
Nice.

488
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,412
Yeah.

489
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,872
She seems like a good person, too.

490
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,709
-Very pure.
-Yeah, she's overflowing with it.

491
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,210
That'll be interesting.
