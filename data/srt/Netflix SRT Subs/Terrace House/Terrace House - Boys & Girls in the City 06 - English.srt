1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,933
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,893
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,187
{\an8}<i>living together, and we observe</i>
<i>how they interact with each other.</i>

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,273
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,151
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,112
Ayumu is absent again today
for reasons related to him being young.

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,781
That's right.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,617
-Now, so far...
-Yes.

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,368
First of all,

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,370
-Tatsuya is now on summer break.
-Yes.

12
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,665
He has asked all
three girls out on dates.

13
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,084
-It's Uchi Week.
-Uchi Week.

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,586
It's ridiculous.

15
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,754
{\an8}-Something I can enjoy.
-What?

16
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,880
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23
MIZUKI SHIDA, 22

17
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,966
{\an8}Isn't it usually the other way around?

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
{\an8}Then I'll make plans.

19
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,552
{\an8}-Really?
-What?

20
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,387
{\an8}I'll go out with Minori, too.

21
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,973
{\an8}How about you, Minori?

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,141
{\an8}-I...
-We'll discuss.

23
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:02,187
{\an8}<i>So each of the three has their own way.</i>
<i>He's approaching each girl differently.</i>

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,607
-In front of everyone.
-Yes, he was.

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,024
I hope it will be disastrous.

26
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,777
Is it possible to screw them all up?

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,989
{\an8}-What he thinks of you.
-You asked that?

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,115
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21
MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21

29
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,075
{\an8}-In a different way.
-Very straightforward.

30
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,745
{\an8}-What do you think of me?
-Seriously?

31
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,247
{\an8}-I think highly of her.
-Highly?

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,166
{\an8}Why doesn't anybody think of me as a girl?

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,085
{\an8}-I do.
-No, you don't.

34
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,169
{\an8}I do too.

35
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,631
{\an8}-She doesn't feel it.
-I don't.

36
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,132
{\an8}<i>So what's with that?</i>

37
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,217
Why is Makoto ambiguous like that?

38
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,636
Does he like her or...

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,595
-He likes her.
-Oh.

40
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,766
And Minori is ready
to return the feeling, too.

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,143
-Yes, she is.
-And the tap dancer,

42
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,936
-Mr. Adachi.
-That's right.

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,231
-A problem about the aquarium.
-Yes, they made similar plans.

44
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,693
-Which aquarium?
-The one in Sky Tree.

45
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,195
I'm taking her to Enoshima.

46
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,907
{\an8}Different aquariums.
What kind of duel will this be?

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,199
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28, TAP DANCER

48
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,325
{\an8}Right.

49
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,413
{\an8}So, Yuriko is showing interest
in the tap dancer,

50
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:06,627
but what if Uchi, kinda,
comes in high-handedly on to Yuriko,

51
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,337
who is innocently watching the fish,
and kisses her?

52
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,214
What?

53
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,593
And because of the kiss,
her feelings are forcibly shaken up.

54
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,346
-What?
-I want something like that to happen.

55
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,723
No, I totally don't want that.

56
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:20,974
Yeah, I want to see that.

57
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,352
I want a walrus to make outrageous
sounds when the vibe gets good.

58
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,233
-A walrus?
-Walruses make crazy sounds.

59
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,359
-I know.
-Right?

60
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,278
Yeah, walruses are scary.

61
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,281
That's not what I wanted to talk about.

62
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:43,080
I can't really distinguish
between a seal, a walrus and a fur seal.

63
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,207
Is the gentlest one a seal?

64
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,792
-Isn't it the fur seal?
-The fur seal.

65
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,961
Fur seal, seal, then walrus.

66
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,838
-Isn't it enough already?
-Therefore,

67
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,840
who's the fur seal, who's the walrus,

68
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,632
and who's the seal?

69
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:55,926
I get it.

70
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,595
I thought they were all walruses.

71
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,138
None of them are decent.

72
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,974
You got wrapped up with the walrus talk.

73
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,560
Shoot! I was trying to pull things back.

74
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,320
{\an8}DAIBA, TOKYO

75
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,368
{\an8}-This is amazing.
-Wow.

76
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,329
Excuse me.

77
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,207
It's so beautiful here.

78
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,335
It's so nice.

79
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,338
-Is this the first part of the date plan?
-The first part..

80
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,757
Thank you.

81
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,052
-I've decided.
-Are you ready to order?

82
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,303
How about you?

83
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,140
Hmm? Me? Ahi poke.

84
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,975
Me? Ahi poke.

85
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,394
Why?

86
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,854
It's the same.

87
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,188
-Shall we?
-Let's eat.

88
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,857
This is great.

89
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,442
Yuriko told me something.

90
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,155
It seems like we're being compared
or something.

91
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,697
Yes, like it's a taste test.

92
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,367
No, not like that.

93
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,246
Well, Makocchan said that it was weird

94
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,457
for you to date all three of us girls.

95
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,542
Really?

96
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,421
-Why?
-Maybe he's jealous.

97
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,966
Well, it's not like Minori
and Makocchan are together.

98
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,092
-If I--
-No, not yet at all.

99
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,261
No matter how much
Minori and I hang out together,

100
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,180
-it's none of his business.
-For sure.

101
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,641
{\an8}TOKYO LEISURE LAND

102
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,185
{\an8}It's nice here.

103
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,602
{\an8}-It's nice.
-This is great.

104
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,188
{\an8}Just great.

105
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,153
{\an8}I did it!
Did you see that?

106
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,613
{\an8}-I'll hit the seven.
-Seven.

107
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,661
-That was good.
-All right.

108
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,121
What? You go like this?

109
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,083
Wait.

110
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,043
Okay, okay.

111
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
Okay, okay.

112
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,547
Watch out.

113
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,382
Okay, okay.

114
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,927
It fell down.

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,554
This is so difficult.

116
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,974
{\an8}Exercise is nice.

117
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,350
{\an8}-Yeah.
-The exercise...

118
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,393
{\an8}I want to exercise.

119
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,230
{\an8}Girls I can exercise with are...

120
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,358
I'll do it, but I suck.

121
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,611
I like girls that have the attitude
to just do it regardless.

122
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,198
It was a good date.

123
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,158
-It was a good date.
-Good date.

124
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,204
Next will be my turn.

125
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,413
-Okay.
-I'll think of something.

126
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,082
I look forward to it.

127
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,666
I wonder what you like.

128
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,212
Think about it. Think about it.

129
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,175
-You throwing it out?
-Here.

130
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,594
Thanks. You're so kind.

131
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,269
-You want to go?
-Okay.

132
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,646
We'll miss dinner if we don't.

133
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,649
{\an8}IKEBUKURO, TOKYO

134
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,735
{\an8}MO-MO-PARADISE

135
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,113
{\an8}How was Leisure Land?

136
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,074
{\an8}I think things opened up today.

137
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,784
{\an8}I see.

138
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,161
-Don't you think so?
-Hmm?

139
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,537
-I had fun.
-You had fun.

140
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,872
-A lot.
-A lot.

141
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,666
You had a day off, Mizuki?

142
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,126
I took a day off.

143
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,420
-She took time off.
-For Uchi.

144
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,879
And tomorrow?

145
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,381
Tomorrow is a date with Yuriko.

146
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,051
-This is totally a different subject.
-You're changing it?

147
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,760
-You're changing it?
-Yeah.

148
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,762
Yuki is amazing at tap dancing.

149
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,223
-I researched today.
-You researched.

150
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,683
-Did you research?
-Three-time champion?

151
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,767
National champion three years in a row.

152
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,436
-Really?
-What's with that?

153
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,854
-Remarkable in the tap dance world.
-He's grinning.

154
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,191
You've never said a word about that.

155
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,608
-Humble.
-Humble.

156
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,693
It's amazing.

157
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,778
Isn't three times in a row just amazing?

158
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,739
We're going to see you dance
this week, right?

159
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,658
The day after tomorrow.

160
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,826
That's right.

161
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,828
I'm just so-so.

162
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,832
I found a yuzu.

163
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
When are you gonna leave?

164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,711
You have something after this?

165
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,046
-I have a rehearsal.
-Oh, yeah?

166
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,130
All of a sudden.

167
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,134
-Makoto, here, for now.
-Oh, cash.

168
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,971
You're going?

169
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,056
I'll zip out and zip back.

170
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,059
-Do your best.
-I'll do my best.

171
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,143
See you.

172
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,436
When are you going out tomorrow?

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,231
In the morning?

174
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,899
-Around 5:00 p.m.
-After school?

175
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,193
-Is it okay?
-Sure.

176
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,445
Where are we going?

177
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,822
-It's a secret.
-It's a secret?

178
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,742
I gave a lot of thought
about how I could entertain you.

179
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,077
Thank you.

180
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,581
What's going on with you two?

181
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,959
-You're all flirty.
-It happens.

182
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,211
-Yuriko.
-Tatsuya.

183
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,506

00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,135
{\an8}Phew.

191
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,808
-Rather...
-It's really low.

192
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,268
It's really low.

193
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,358
-I can't see what it looks like.
-You can't see.

194
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,652
All right.

195
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,822
-Are you working tonight?
-I'm working tonight.

196
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,906
At the cafe.

197
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,491
-Right, at the cafe tonight.
-Yup.

198
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,161
-I'll go there sometime.
-Please.

199
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,205
Barista.

200
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,997
All done.

201
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,625
But you can't see the back.

202
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
You're all ready.

203
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,549
What are you wearing?

204
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,593
It's Yuriko's style.

205
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,179
Is it Yuriko's style?

206
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,140
-Did you do it?
-I got it done.

207
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,975
-It's nice. A hair clip?
-So?

208
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,977
-Did Mizuki do it for you?
-Yes.

209
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,354
Yes, Mizuki did it for me.

210
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,189
-Want to go?
-Want to go?

211
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,898
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

212
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,525
Thank you, Mizuki.

213
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,943
Have fun.

214
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,369
I've been nervous all day.

215
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,164
-I couldn't focus on my studies.
-That's good, good.

216
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,999
It's good to be nervous.

217
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,085
-Actually, I...
-Yes?

218
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,382
What, are you making
some kind of shocking statement?

219
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,343
I like aquariums.

220
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,638
What? What's that?

221
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,807
I heard we're going to an aquarium.

222
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,851
-Was that leaked somehow?
-A little.

223
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,270
Moreover...

224
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,523
Enoshima?

225
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,358
You know!

226
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,111
-I wonder who gave it away?
-Who could it be?

227
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,571
It's pretty backed up.

228
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,908
We might make it just in time.

229
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,661
-It closes at 8:00 p.m.
-Oh, really?

230
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,664
{\an8}ENOSHIMA

00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,750

232
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,336
-It's already closed.
-It's closed.

233
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,462
CLOSED FOR TODAY
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN

234
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,047
{\an8}I'm so sorry about that.

235
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,300
{\an8}Oh, I'm so sorry, too.

236
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,970
-This isn't good.
-It's not good.

237
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,223
I want to bow down on my knees.

238
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,475
I must make up for this.

239
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,811
-Yeah?
-Next time.

240
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,314
-Let's do this again.
-All right.

241
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,481
NEW ENOSHIMA AQUARIUM

242
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,982
I'm shocked.

243
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,069
Oh, come on. Cheer up.

244
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,533
{\an8}Cheers.

245
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,577
{\an8}Cheers.

246
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,666
-It's good.
-Delicious.

247
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,251
Can I try?

248
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,296
Ginger and pineapple, right?

249
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,089
It's delicious.

250
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,302
-It's not for me.
-Really?

251
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,095
It doesn't taste good.

252
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,267
I want to go to Enoshima Aquarium.

253
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,853
Man, you're really dwelling on it.

254
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,480
I am truly sorry.

255
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,732
-Let's go.
-Next time.

256
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,652
-Oh, it's really coming down.
-Yeah.

257
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,990
This feels really new to me.

258
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,074
New?

259
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,661
I've never been out for dinner
with someone dressed so beautifully.

260
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,205
-Do I look that beautiful?
-Yeah.

261
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,500
Looks appealing.

262
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,127
-To the general public.
-Not that much.

263
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,087
Objectively speaking.

264
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,006
Objectively, huh?

265
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,884
What? What do you mean?
What do you mean?

266
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,304
Well, you yourself
look widely appealing.

267
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,055
No, not me.

268
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,558
-I'm pretty horrible on the inside.
-Really?

269
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,228
But actually,
you seem to be the most conscientious.

270
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,939
Or is that a mask?

271
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,412
-I'm back.
-You're back.

272
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,707
Hey.

273
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,502
-Uchi, how was your second date?
-How was it?

274
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,963
Being alone together was different.

275
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,424
-Really?
-With Yuriko.

276
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,634
-Totally different?
-But in a good way?

277
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,929
-Well...
-What?

278
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,681
I don't think in a good way.

279
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,308
-Not in a good way.
-Really?

280
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,475
What do you mean?

281
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,851
It took a lot of effort.

282
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:49,977
-You did?
-I did.

283
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,939
-Why?
-It's not like it was Yuriko's fault.

284
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,483
I think it was the way I approached her.

285
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,859
Among other things.

286
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,196
I was really tense.

287
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,534
Well, when I went for drinks with Yuriko,

288
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,456
she said you made her nervous,

289
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,290
or something like that.

290
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,837
I wasn't really able
to keep a conversation going with her...

291
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,004
-well.
-You?

292
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,049
-Something about Yuriko--
-It seems you have regrets.

293
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,552
I'm reflecting on it.

294
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,970
Like, my--

295
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,888
You don't need to feel so down.

296
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,351
-I think he is.
-Yeah, really. I'm feeling down.

297
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,062
Wow. The stress is awful.

298
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,399
Just amazing.

299
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,900
Hey, you're really feeling it.

300
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,736
Such amazing stress.

301
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,279
Only words of disdain come to my mouth.

302
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,033
He's a new type.

303
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,660
It's amazing.

304
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,913
But with Mizuki he seemed all right.

305
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,124
Yes, they seemed to be having fun.

306
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,167
And he said right in front of her,

307
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,128
"I've thought about our date tomorrow,

308
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,130
so please look forward to it."

309
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,841
But in the end,
because it didn't go well,

310
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:06,554
he got nervous, and in a bad way,
that the date didn't go the way he wanted.

311
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,683
But that thing about Uchi getting nervous,
perhaps...

312
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,894
-Yes.
-From his perspective,

313
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,271
"What's up with her?"

314
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,109
Like, "Why am I, of all people,
being so awkward?"

315
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,569
Like, "What is this?"

316
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,822
So, I think that has a chance of
evolving to romantic feelings.

317
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,159
Is it like,
"Why am I struggling with this?"

318
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,452
That's right.

319
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,167
But then again, Uchi...

320
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,711
despite that does things

321
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,673
-like grab her drink.
-Yeah.

322
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,551
Yuriko is quite something, too.

323
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,512
She doesn't seem in any way
affected by any of that.

324
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,346
Huh!

325
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,683
It's not working,
so Tatsuya is like, "What?"

326
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,726
-Something like that.
-I think so.

327
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,690
Usually, there would be
some kind of hesitation, but there wasn't.

328
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,692
So, "My moves aren't working."

329
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,652
Man, it's like Goku and Vegeta.

330
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,321
Amazing.

331
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,073
That's right. Like, pow, pow!
Then, pow, pow!

332
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,408
-What?
-Like, pow, pow, pow!

333
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,492
Amazing!

334
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,243
I wonder what Yuriko thinks about it.

335
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,870
-I wonder.
-Right.

336
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,747
Oh, like, "She's this type."

337
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,292
Like when Yuriko said,
"I wanted to go to the aquarium."

338
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,838
Like that.
That's a leading punch, you could say.

339
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,465
-I see.
-Right.

340
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,635
Yuriko told him
that she wanted to go...

341
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,889
but not necessarily with him.

342
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,183
And she's putting him on the line for it.

343
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,854
Right, so, her punch landed.

344
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,064
-It landed heavily.
-Heavily.

345
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,525
-So Tatsuya was caught off guard.
-That's right.

346
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,401
-Yuriko is the better player.
-Yeah.

347
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,153
-Amazing.
-Amazing.

348
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,114
-She's an unexpected monster.
-Amazing.

349
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,866
Maybe Yuriko was the walrus.

350
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,201
-What?
-She's a beast.

351
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,953
Amazing.

352
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,039
{\an8}NAKAMEGURO, TOKYO

353
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,083
{\an8}-Where?
-Where?

354
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,043
{\an8}Minori, can you put this in?

355
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,045
{\an8}Sorry.

356
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,548
{\an8}Hold this.

357
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,258
{\an8}-Hmm?
-Never mind.

358
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,677
{\an8}-Here?
-It's here.

359
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,762
{\an8}-Here it is.
-Here.

360
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,724
{\an8}It's under Yuki Adachi.

361
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,101
Someone else is coming later.

362
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,269
That will be 3,000 yen.

363
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,937
-Three thousand yen.
-Okay.

364
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,899
Hey.

365
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,401
Sorry for making you wait.

366
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,279
-You look kinda cool.
-Kind of? Thanks.

367
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,490
-Phew.
-The career woman vibe.

368
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,743
Like a career woman?

369
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,662
-Can I eat it?
-Sure, eat it.

370
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,914
Oh, it's starting.

371
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,125
-Adachi.
-That startled me!

372
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,960
Really?

373
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,884
-Amazing.
-Amazing.

374
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,252
Thank you very much.

375
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,842
-I'm knocked out.
-That was really cool.

376
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,636
That was beyond expectation.

377
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,345
It was cool.

378
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,139
Outrageous.

379
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,269
{\an8}That was badass.

380
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,563
I was surprised.

381
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,857
Were you impressed?

382
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,567
-That guy is cool.
-It was cool.

383
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,414
-Yes?
-It's Yuriko.

384
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,082
-Come in.
-Is Uchi here?

385
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,793
He's here.

386
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,003
Uchi, Yuriko's here.

387
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,130
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

388
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,675
-Hey, what's up?
-Thanks for letting me in.

389
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,010
I was thinking about
what we'd do tomorrow.

390
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
Right, tomorrow.

391
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,056
What'll we do?

392
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,895
We can't go to the aquarium, right?

393
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,314
Do you want to go to the aquarium?

394
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,026
-It doesn't have to be.
-It doesn't?

395
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,654
Well, you'll be going to
the aquarium with Yuki.

396
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,405
Yes, that's true.

397
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,159
If you just want to
do something with Uchi,

398
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,830
-then something else is...
-It doesn't have to be the aquarium.

399
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,499
So, do you want to just hang out with me
instead of having a do-over?

400
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,880
What? What's with that response?

401
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,426
It doesn't have to be the aquarium.

402
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,303
Let's just go out tomorrow.

403
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,181
Whatever the case,
do you want to go out tomorrow?

404
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,184
I'll think of something.

405
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,896
-I feel bad to make you plan again.
-No, no. It was me who...

406
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,482
Because of the time,
we weren't able to make it.

407
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
Okay.

408
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,488
-So, be ready for tomorrow?
-Yes.

409
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,740
Tomorrow...

410
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,742
Yes.

411
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,619
Are you okay to hang out with me tomorrow?

412
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,290
-There's some pretense there.
-Yeah, some pretense.

413
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,918
Yeah, you did that with some pretense.

414
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,336
That's right.

415
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,546
It doesn't have to be with me?

416
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,716
-I don't know.
-Right.

417
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,343
I don't know what's going on
with your mind, so...

418
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,850
I guess you don't know.

419
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,769
So we'll go?

420
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,687
-Okay.
-Sorry about this.

421
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,148
I'll think about it tomorrow.

422
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,900
-I suddenly showed up here.
-Oh, no, no.

423
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,818
-Good night.
-Good night.

424
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,069
Good night.

425
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,784
I'll think about it.

426
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,787
I wonder what was on her mind.

427
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,288
Indeed.

428
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,415
That's what I was thinking of asking.

429
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,792
-Right.
-Just now.

430
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,584
She made a suggestion first.

431
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,642
What's the matter, Yuri?

432
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,229
What is it?

433
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,483
What happened?

434
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,569
Tissue, tissue.

435
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,452
What happened?

436
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,454
I'm so confused and...

437
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,832
not sure at all.

438
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:36,170
After seeing Yuki's dance,

439
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,091
I came home, and Makocchan
was in the living room.

440
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,051
He said that Uchi told him...

441
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:47,514
that his date with you
was carefree and fun.

442
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:52,394
But it seemed he was
quite tense on our date.

443
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,274
Uchi told him something like that.

444
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,111
So, I heard that from Makocchan.

445
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,779
And then I really didn't know
what was going on anymore.

446
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:07,493
And then I just went to the guy's room

447
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,912
just to ask what we were going to do.

448
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,581
But then...

449
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,835
Makocchan kind of implied that

450
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,794
I didn't seem eager to go
to the aquarium.

451
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,505
He asked if I wanted to go.

452
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,633
I don't know what made him say that.

453
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,513
So, like, I heard it from Makocchan--

454
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,723
-Like, it means he knows, too.
-Yes, that's right.

455
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,853
So they both asked me what I wanted.

456
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,814
After that, Makocchan texted me,

457
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,692
like, "Are you all right?

458
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,154
Let me know if there's something

459
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,448
you find hard to discuss with Uchi.

460
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm in my room, so you can call me
over anytime."

461
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,249
And then something like,
"I don't want to see you sad."

462
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,918
I kinda forgot.

463
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,420
I'm really confused.

464
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,463
Like, why did he text me that?

465
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,591
You know, these past two or three days,

466
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,761
I had a moment when I thought that
Makocchan liked you.

467
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,973
-But...
-Is that...

468
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,517
But, I don't know.
Maybe I'm thinking too much.

469
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,396
But isn't Makocchan like that
with everyone?

470
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,858
Recently, I've been a little unsure
of Makocchan.

471
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,196
I'm really not sure about him.

472
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,282
-Whoa!
-What, what?

473
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,035
-Amazing!
-We're confused too!

474
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,619
Let's all cry together.

475
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,206
I can't get my mind in order.

476
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,585
So, to get to Yuriko, Makoto...

477
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,712
did this little thing...

478
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,173
-No.
-Is he that type of guy?

479
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,050
Maybe he doesn't know that
he shouldn't tell.

480
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,259
-He doesn't know.
-He doesn't.

481
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,344
Wait.

482
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:53,515
A normal adult
wouldn't tell someone that

483
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,102
their date was tense with them.

484
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,104
You don't ever do that.

485
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,357
He's a lot like Seina.

486
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,441
{\an8}Really?

487
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,650
{\an8}SEINA SHIMABUKURO, 28

488
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,611
{\an8}He's Seina as a pitcher.

489
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:12,326
Everyone sees Makoto as
trying his hardest at baseball.

490
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,204
-He's tanned.
-Yes, he's serious.

491
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,457
Remember he quit for two years
to just lounge around.

492
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,917
-That's right.
-However,

493
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,921
it's like we've been fooled to think
he doesn't have experience with girls.

494
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,258
-It is weird.
-He's a real monster.

495
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,136
This person is not a decent human either.

496
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,428
-Mr. Yamasato?
-Yeah?

497
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,514
-They're not listening to you at all.
-What?

498
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,599
-Oh, sorry.
-No way!

499
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,645
They're totally not listening.

500
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,231
If this was a crime drama,
I would be off the cliff.

501
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,566
-By yourself.
-By myself.

502
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,068
-No one there.
-Sorry.

503
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,112
No, really.
If he was evil, what would you do?

504
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,946
-That would be a shock.
-If he was a mastermind.

505
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,449
Even the barista said that.

506
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,493
"I think he's been strange lately."

507
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,287
-She doesn't know.
-Right.

508
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,081
It's like they suddenly noticed something.

509
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,875
Yes, come to think of it,
he's been asleep the whole time.

510
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,629
-But why did Makocchan say that?
-Yeah.

511
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,715
I don't think he's just dumb.
It's astonishing...

512
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,883
Really?

513
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,177
Is he just a child?

514
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,556
But that text,
"I don't want to see you sad."

515
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,559
-For a child, that seems like...
-Oh, that's right.

516
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,561
how an adult would approach someone.

517
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,772
Maybe it's a line he's seen before.
Maybe he borrowed the whole line.

518
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,107
"I don't want to see you sad."

519
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,443
-"I think I read that in a book before".
-That's right.

520
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,321
Oh, <i>Guri and Gura's Adventures.</i>

521
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,073
What an idiot!

522
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,825
"When Gura was sad,
this is what Guri said."

523
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,454
It's weird that a 21-year-old is
referring to <i>Guri and Gura.</i>

524
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,705
What an idiot!

525
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,458
The best case scenario is that
he's an idiot.

526
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,710
If he isn't, then it's quite unusual.

527
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,753
-Right.
-All of it.

528
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,256
If this was all calculated behavior,
it would be...

529
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,133
-That's frightening.
-A real horror.

530
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,634
That would be frightening.

531
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,285
You got a minute?

532
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,706
What's up?
You startled me.

533
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,339
You said to Yuriko...

534
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,093
that Uchi expressed...

535
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,680
how he was tense with her.

536
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,766
What did you intend by that?

537
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,186
To Yuriko?

538
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:51,193
If it was something that was
just between you guys

539
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,279
that you secretly told Yuriko,

540
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,489
then, of course, that would be uncool.

541
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,868
Or, if you like her or whatever
and was concerned about her--

542
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,953
-Me?
-Yes. Just, if so.

543
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,665
And you told her because of that,

544
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,459
well, it was still a wrong thing to do.

545
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,504
If that was something positive, it's fine.

546
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:15,551
But if it's something negative for Yuriko,
it could mess her up.

547
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,929
I wonder if you thought of
how it could affect her

548
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,433
and how it would negatively affect Uchi.

549
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,810
Like, they're going to be unsure
of each other now.

550
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,147
Yuriko is so concerned about it,
she can't think of the date.

551
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,945
Don't you feel bad that she's concerned
about how he thinks of her?

552
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,113
I mean, I feel sorry for Uchi, too.

553
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,617
I'm sure he told you
because he trusts you.

554
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,455
Well, I just said
whatever I heard yesterday.

555
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,665
It just came out.

556
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,084
You have to make things vague.

557
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,838
Well, she can still ask about it
if I make things vague.

558
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,425
I feel bad for what I started.

559
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,180
Whatever the case,
I figured something wasn't right.

560
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,231
Just be careful with what you say.

561
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,940
Good night.

562
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,985
What a bummer.
