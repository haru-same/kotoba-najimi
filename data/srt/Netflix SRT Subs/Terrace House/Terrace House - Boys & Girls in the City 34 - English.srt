1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,056
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,684
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,310
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,229
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,982
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,860
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:32,032
{\an8}So last week, Rikopin and Hayato
went out on a date to a meat festival.

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,161
{\an8}<i>-The weather was so nice.</i>
<i>-He's 11 years older than her,</i>

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,039
but the difference in age didn't show.

10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,293
She did say
dating someone 11 years older is scary.

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,630
I've only ever dated guys my own age.

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,341
I like experiencing things together.

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,261
Like going somewhere
for the first time together.

14
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,848
She'd like couples to experience
things for the first time together.

15
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,100
-How adorable.
-So cute.

16
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,935
Rikochan began to make some moves.

17
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,187
<i>-Finally.</i>
<i>-She went for a job interview.</i>

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>-Finally.</i>
<i>-Finally.</i>

19
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,482
She ate a proper dinner
for the first time.

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,068
-Her comment caught me by surprise.
-Totally.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,778
I didn't know we had this.

22
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,989
This is the first time I'm eating in here.

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,366
Whatever the case, it is peaceful.

24
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,743
-It is.
-For sure.

25
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,621
-But incidents are happening.
-Certainly.

26
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,456
-Hayato cried.
-Yes, he cried.

27
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,793
Yes, about how he gave up acting and why.

28
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,212
It really takes courage.

29
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,297
But I'd already made my decision.

30
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,174
Of course it's frustrating.

31
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,218
I don't think you have to give up.

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,470
I've already decided.

33
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,891
And finally, the immobile Arman...

34
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,853
-may be falling in step for love.
-That's right.

35
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,479
-This week is the date, right?
-Right.

36
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,565
-We'll see if issues arise as it unfolds.
-Right?

37
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,778
{\an8}He'll be taking Momoka, who loves comedy,
to Earth's show.

38
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,071
{\an8}-Earth!
-Man, it's been so long!

39
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,198
{\an8}Earth! What are they up to now?

40
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,118
{\an8}You mentioned
you wanted to see a comedy show.

41
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,163
{\an8}Ippei said there's something next Sunday.

42
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,623
{\an8}I'm looking forward to it.

43
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,457
{\an8}-I'll find out what time it starts.
-Okay.

44
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,543
{\an8}We're not going to the beach?

45
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,630
{\an8}-We'll do the beach next time.
-Next time? Okay.

46
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,132
{\an8}What was that?
It was like Momoka approached him.

47
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,383
Right.

48
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,219
I think she might already be into him.

49
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,597
<i>The fact she stared at the stars in bed</i>
<i>means she was thinking of him.</i>

50
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>That's right.</i>

51
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,352
But she might also be totally nuts
about stars.

52
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,940
Like, totally fanatic about them.

53
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,651
-Her parents might not approve.
-Right?

54
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:33,361
You know?

55
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,822
A guy with tattoos...

56
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,282
"Oh, dear! A man with tattoos.

57
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,995
Momoka dear, this man has tattoos!"

58
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,834
Your impression sounds more
like an effeminate man.

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,461
{\an8}-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

60
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,213
{\an8}-Welcome home.
-I'm back.

61
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,678
Oh, beer.
Lots of beer.

62
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,013
Do you want one?

63
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,058
-I can't.
-You can't?

64
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,227
-I've seen you drink.
-I can drink, but...

65
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,311
You have work tomorrow?

66
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,397
-It's my first day as a ballet teacher.
-That's right.

67
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,899
-It's your first time?
-Yeah.

68
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,192
What about you, Arman?

69
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,237
I'm carrying the mikoshi in Asakusa.

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,072
-Oh, the mikoshi!
-Oh, wow!

71
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,406
-Like this?
-Yeah.

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,533
I'll be doing that tomorrow
and the day after.

73
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm not sure if I need to bring anything.

74
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,912
It's my first time carrying one.

75
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,124
-Wow.
-It suits you. You fit the role.

76
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,085
You totally fit the role.

77
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,921
-I've always been interested.
-Will you wear a hachimaki headband?

78
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,675
-Sounds interesting.
-If you're free this Sunday, come watch.

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,179
-I want to.
-I also want to watch.

80
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,182
{\an8}CHUO-KU, CHIBA

81
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,185
{\an8}DANCE STUDIO

82
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,854
{\an8}I'm Momoka Mitsunaga.

83
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:53,275
{\an8}By way of quick introduction,
I've been dancing since I was five.

84
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,527
I've also studied ballet abroad.

85
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm hoping I can pass on to you
even a little bit of what I've learned.

86
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,369
-I'm looking forward to working with you.
-Thank you.

87
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,038
-Please do your best.
-Yes.

88
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,748
-Let's begin.
-Thank you.

89
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,752
To the back. Return.
To the side. Return.

90
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,754
To the front. Return.

91
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:18,801
Lift and bend your knees.
More this way.

92
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,971
Yes, now place your feet down,
and that's it.

93
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,223
That was perfect.

94
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:31,313
What we just did are the movements
of a pirouette.

95
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,564
This.

96
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,734
This shape is the foundation of the spin.

97
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,197
-Once you get it down, it'll be easier...
-Will we be able to spin?

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,909
Of course you'll be able to!

99
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,372
{\an8}When should we go on our next date?

100
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,001
We're going on another date?
Has that been decided already?

101
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,045
No, not at all.

102
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,254
Do you want to?

103
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,631
Have you thought...

104
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,845
that maybe you don't want to?

105
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,055
You mean go on a date with you?

106
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,976
I do want to go out with you.
Why? You don't want to?

107
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:15,107
I'm younger,
so I feel like you think I'm just a kid.

108
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,109
Your age doesn't bother me.

109
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,445
How can I put it?

110
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,405
Age is just a number.

111
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,994
-It's just for reference.
-A reference?

112
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,829
I see.

113
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,831
Even if you were 29...

114
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,708
you'd still be you.

115
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,878
I suppose that's true.

116
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,756
Where do you want to go?

117
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,885
Anywhere.

118
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,719
There it is.

119
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,930
Would you prefer the city or nature?

120
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,849
-Either.
-There it is again.

121
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,726
Jeez.

122
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,520
Have you ever been...

123
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,356
to Tsukiji Market?

124
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,317
-No.
-Then let's go to Tsukiji.

125
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,488
You can eat fish there.

126
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,198
-Nice.
-Is it?

127
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,742
-I guess it's decided then.
-Okay.

128
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,583
-It's funny.
-What's funny?

129
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,211
-It's funny.
-Why?

130
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,630
That you're interested in an 18-year-old.

131
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,218
-I'm going to bed.
-Okay. Good night.

132
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,681
Good night.

{\an8}-Will they go through here?
-I don't know.

142
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,827
{\an8}It's amazing.

143
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,081
-It's so nice in Asakusa.
-Is this your second time here?

144
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,833
My third. Or is it my fourth?

145
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,337
-It's increased.
-Yeah, I've been a lot.

146

-Is Arman coming?
-Will we find him?

147
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,978
-Can you see him, Riko?
-I can't see him.

148
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,897
Huh? Where?

149
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,566
-There he is!
-Arman!

150
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,570
There he is.

151
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,782
Are they saying something?

-Arman!
-Arman!

153
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,162
So cool!

154
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,080
You're so cool, Arman!

155
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,791
-Arman!
-Arman!

156
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,253
-Arman!
-Arman! You look like a different person.

157
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,838
-That was cool.
-He was so cool.

158
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,385
Hey! Hey! Hey!

159
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,942

161
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,245
Welcome. Welcome.

162
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,039
This is amazing.

163
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,292
{\an8}-It's this thing.
-I've seen this before.

164
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,336
I made this at home.

165
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,379
-What, this?
-All of this.

166
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,006
-This too.
-You made this, too?

167
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,009
-Yeah, last night.
-Amazing.

168
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:16,556
-What were you doing today, Hansan?
-Well, I was here...

169
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,810
This restaurant belongs to
a former client of mine.

170
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,772
Tomorrow,
the parade will pass in front of it.

171
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,484
So they want to have a little storefront
for when that happens.

172
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,986
So I was helping them out a bit.

173
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,488
-So that's why.
-Yes.

174
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,283
-How was it?
-He wasn't the Arman we normally see.

175
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,119
-Was he serious?
-It was really...

176
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,037
He was in the very front, holding it.

177
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,831
-Nice.
-It was cool.

178
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,292
-Oh, Arman.
-Yo.

179
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,128
-You worked so hard.
-Arman, what's up?

180
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,504
What's up?

181
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
-Did you cut your hair?
-I did.

182
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,798
-It looks good.
-It looks good.

183
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,925
-Thanks.
-It's refreshing.

184
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,887
-You were so cool.
-Oh, really? Thanks.

185
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
-Did you shave your beard a little too?
-Yeah.

186
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,974
-Oh, he did.
-You look better that way.

187
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,643
It's good.

188
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,646
-We started already.
-Oh, no worries.

189
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,898
-Was it fun?
-It was really fun.

190
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,236
-The vibe and the whole scene was great.
-It looked like fun.

191
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,905
It was so much fun.
I'm so happy now.

192
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,534
Arman, there's something
I was thinking about.

193
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,830
-Yesterday...
-Oh, yesterday!

194
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,958
-The vibe seemed pretty good.
-Yeah, it seemed good.

195
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,670
-What?
-Well, Hayato was in the living room--

196
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,006
-His head was like this beside you.
-Yeah, his head was like this.

197
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,468
-Like, lying down and...
-No, Hansan, it wasn't like that.

198
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,887
It seemed like you guys were
really getting along there.

199
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,055
Yeah, it seemed good.

200
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,849
-The air surrounding you two was...
-It seemed so natural.

201
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,643
It was like...
So open and...

202
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,728
It really was.

203
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,856
-Did he ask you to go out somewhere again?
-Yeah, he did.

204
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,400
-He did?
-He did?

205
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,611
That's a big deal!

206
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,281
I don't know what the boys
have talked about.

207
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,159
I don't think Hayato has zero interest.

208
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,286
Of course he doesn't have zero interest.

209
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,079
-Right.
-It's obvious.

210
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:08,460
Although he tells me not to be concerned
about our age difference, I'm concerned.

211
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,545
Right, your age difference.

212
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,131
But the moment you like each other,
that won't matter anymore.

213
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,884
It's like I have to grow up a little.

214
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,555
I think that part will be
a little tiresome for me.

215
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,601
I think you won't be happy if you're bound
by the ideas you've come up with.

216
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,061
I think you would be happiest
if you break those binds

217
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,272
and just go with how you feel.

218
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,649
Yeah, I agree with that.

219
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,612
-You understand that.
-Riko understands that.

220
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,659
So what's up with the vibe
between Hayato and Riko?

221
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,036
-It's really nice.
-It's a good vibe.

222
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,957
That whole thing where she thinks
she's too childish or something...

223
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,376
-So cute.
-It's cute.

224
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,504
And then she'll try to really grow up
and be mature.

225
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,340
But then he'll come and say,
"Just going your pace,"

226
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,259
and pat her head.

227
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,636
-"Aw, come now."
-"Come now."

228
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,596
Like in the mangas.

229
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,181
But it seemed like they got along.

230
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:09,145
It seemed like they were closer today
than at their meat festival date.

231
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,523
Yeah, when they were pretty chummy
on the sofa.

232
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,485
Hayato is relaxed.
There are no signs of nervousness at all.

233
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,611
That's right.

234
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,239
Like, "We've been together for five years.

235
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,784
Come on, choose. Why not?

236
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,494
He said "there it is" so many times.

237
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,205
Like, what exactly was "it"?

238
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,084
Anyway Kentaro,
given what your life is like,

239
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,338
three-year-olds squeal at you, right?

240
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,340
Anyways?

241
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,884
I'm not that great
with people younger than me.

242
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,261
-That's good to know.
-It is.

243
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,056
-So you tend to go for older women?
-I guess so.

244
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,352
What would be the oldest
you would consider for a girlfriend?

245
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,562
Well...

246
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,564
Come on, just say fairly old.

247
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,899
It would be better if you say a bit older.

248
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:59,696
But listen, what if you say a bit older
but you still didn't qualify?

249
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,785
-Okay, so honestly now.
-Yeah, honestly.

250
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:11,999
My sister is 28 right now,
so maybe 25 or 26.

251
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,961
No, I think you can even go up to 32.

252
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,296
-I've never gone that far.
-Right?

253
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,424
That's so nice to know.

254
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,675
It's so nice.

255
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,095
I'm saying it's good to know,
but he's the same age as my son!

256
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,475
As long as you're not related.

257
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,935
I agree, but my son's watching!

258
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,437
I'm so stupid.

259
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,905
{\an8}-Morning.
-Morning.

260
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,616
{\an8}Thanks for getting it.

261
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,619
-Oh, hamburger ingredients?
-So teach me.

262
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,955
-Should I cut up some onion?
-Can you cut onion?

263
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,290
-I can cut onion.
-Really?

264
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,501
Upright.

265
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,379
You're fast.

266
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,756
If you cut the side, it's quick.

267
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,592
-Don't cut all the way through.
-Right.

268
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,177
Up to here. Be careful.

269
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,972
-Watch out.
-At this point, just chop.

270
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,643
Let's fry this up.

271
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,188
I'm glad you turned out to be decent.

272
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,065
What?

273
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,276
-You thought I was sketchy.
-I'm sorry I called you gross.

274
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,486
So you've said.

275
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,987
-Sorry.
-Like, "This gross guy's here."

276
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,614
Yeah, like, "He's gross."

277
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,534
You said gross because I'm gross, right?

278
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,454
-But turns out you're a normal person.
-What's with that?

279
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,458
-What's critical is how to cook, right?
-Yeah.

280
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,502
-That's all you want to know.
-Yeah.

281
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,505
Press down the center.
It's harder for heat to reach there.

282
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,675
-So make the middle thinner.
-Make the middle thinner.

283
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,843
-There's the edge of the pan, right?
-Yeah.

284
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,804
The edge of the burger should be touching.

285
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,141
-How long do I cook it for?
-Cook the first side until it browns,

286
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,436
then flip it and keep it covered
for seven minutes.

287
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,271
-Less than ten minutes.
-Less than ten minutes.

288
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,651
-Are you having fun at <i>Terrace House?</i>
-Co-living? It's fun.

289
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,277
-I'm glad.
-I'm having fun.

290
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,154
How long have you been here?
Three months?

291
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,449
-It's my third month.
-How is it?

292
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,658
It's fun.

293
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,287
-That's a long time.
-But someone sketchy arrived.

294
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,623
Who, me? I've already heard that.

295
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,462
-It's done.
-It looks good.

296
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,800
It's good.

297
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,681
-Is it okay?
-It's not hard.

298
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,391
Of course it's not hard!

299
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,894
Thank you.

300
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,231
Now I know how to cook a hamburger.

301
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,316
What's next?

302
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,444
Teach me some more.

303
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,028
Sure.

304
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,410
{\an8}-He's sleeping.
-He is.

305
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,915
-Welcome home.
-I'm home.

306
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,501
Welcome home.

307
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,545
-"I love you."
-"I love you."

308
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,258
Sorry, I don't really know
too much about ballerinas.

309
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,136
What is the highest achievement
of a ballerina?

310
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,056
There are only about five ballerinas
every year

311
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,476
that make it as professionals...

312
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,435
out of the entire country.

313
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,855
So I'm trying to be...

314
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,816
one of those five.

315
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,360
That's an amazing place to be.

316
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,030
How old are the ballerinas usually?

317
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,283
Between 18 and 22.

318
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,368
-Oh, that young?
-Yeah.

319
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,121
You usually know by the time you're 22.

320
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,998
Is there an exam to become a professional?

321
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,875
Yes, around March.

322
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,171
No matter how much you practice,
if you fail in March,

323
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,674
it all ends there.

324
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,717
I see.

325
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,721
If you make the slightest error,
they just tell you to go home.

326
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,598
-Really?
-So severe.

327
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,351
-Yeah, so--
-There's no room for mistakes.

328
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,229
You can practice a thousand times over,

329
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,568
but if you mess up just once there,
they say, "Thank you."

330
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,237
What kind of person are they looking for?
I mean, you're so busy.

331
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:15,577
If you have that something
that no one else does...

332
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,330
it would be better.

333
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,667
I think...

334
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,462
that guy over there is pretty nice.

335
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,507
In my opinion...

336
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,010
-For sure.
-...I think it's the best way to be.

337
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,430
I feel happy when I hang out with him.

338
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,641
For sure.

339
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,060
I don't consider him
as a potential mate, so...

340
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,606
She said it out loud.
He might be listening.

341
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,859
He might be listening.

342
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,613
I would be happy
to introduce him to a friend.

343
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,825
I could do that with confidence.

344
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,454
Hey.

345
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,750
Arman, it's late.
You'll sleep better downstairs.

346
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,794
What time is it?

347
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,380
It's okay. Good night.
I'll let you sleep.

348
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,383
-Didn't he just ask what time it is?
-No way.

349
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,469
-And you said it's okay? Oh, okay.
-It's okay.

350
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,513
-What time is it?
-See?

351
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,973
See?

352
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,975
We said it's okay.

353
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,894
-See?
-Really?

354
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,605
I've gotten used to Arman's way
of speaking quickly.

355
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:31,318
The first time I was here,
he talked so fast...

356
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,488
I couldn't understand him.

357
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,991
You gotta stop him and ask,
"Can you say that again?"

358
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,076
Otherwise you can't have a conversation.

359
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,288
-You've got a date with him, right?
-Yes, on Sunday.

360
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,957
Don't just nod and let it go.

361
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,545
Okay, I'll stop him every time.
I'll ask him to repeat everything he says.

362
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,886
-Is it cold?
-No, it's not cold.

363
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,889
-You're not going in?
-What?

364
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,598
-You're not going in?
-No. It's cold!

365
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,976
How boring.

366
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,063
I'll get sunburnt. So cold!

367
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,398
-A tanned ballerina is nice.
-No way.

368
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,359
Is this okay?
It's super cold.

369
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,281
It's cold!

370
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,950
-Isn't it cold?
-It's refreshing.

371
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,285
-What?
-The air is warm.

372
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,547
Wow. The master.

373
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,507
I'll go in next time. Someday.

374
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,719
-Next time?
-Next time.

375
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,636
But I do want to go in.

376
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,604
-Don't go under so suddenly.
-Oh, sorry.

377
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,774
-Did you say something?
-No, I didn't,

378
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,193
but when I looked up you were gone.

379
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,490
-Stop doing it while I'm talking to you.
-Sorry.

380
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,617
-It looks so refreshing.
-It feels great.

381
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,785
Yeah.

382
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,412
-How about we leave soon?
-Sure.

383
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,915
Are you done?
You won't do another lap?

384
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,541
No, I'm good.

385
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,379
It feels nice but cold.

386
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,800
I'll go in next time.

387
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,845
-Comedy.
-I'm looking forward to it.

388
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,554
We gotta go.

389
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,058
{\an8}SHINJUKU, TOKYO

390
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,644
{\an8}I still haven't seen Ippei perform.

391
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,605
{\an8}Don't you get anxious
when it's someone you know?

392
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,565
{\an8}Not really. I'm excited.

393
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,276
{\an8}-Really?
-Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

394
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,237
{\an8}-Don't you worry--
-I've only seen him at the gym.

398
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,050
Thank you, thank you!

399
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,889
I feel really good right now.

400
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:10,812
I came to Shinjuku station
on a bus from Saga.

401
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,524
To you,
the one person who listened to me...

402
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,484
I give my heartfelt thanks.

403
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,238
The next time we meet
will be at the Budokan!

404
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,826
Thanks for today!

405
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,835
I'm feeling good right now.

406
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,378
The next time we meet will be
at the Budokan!

407
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,214
Thank you!

408
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,177
This is the end!
I'm really done!

409
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,386
Thank you!

410
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,890
Seriously, does anyone know her?

411
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,600
Help me, please.

412
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,397
What?

413
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,279
I thought she was applauding...

414
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,115
but she's forming a hamburger patty!

415
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,741
I'm seriously scared!

416
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,954
Thank you.

417
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,460
-Arman!
-Nice job.

418
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,212
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

419
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,756
It's nice to meet you.

420
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,343
-I'm his partner, Manpei.
-It's nice to meet you.

421
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,137
-Thank you.
-It was seriously great.

422
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,304
-Really?
-Yes.

423
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:31,183
-What made you come?
-I really enjoy comedy.

424
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,979
I used to go to shows in Kyoto
when I lived there.

425
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,901
You're on a date?
Quick recovery.

426
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,861
-Quick? It's been awhile actually.
-Oh, has it?

427
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,698
-On to a new love?
-Well... a date anyway.

428
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,994
-Well, I'll see you.
-See you next time.

429
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,163
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

430
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,497
-Thank you.
-Bye.

431
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,957
Thank you.

432
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,709
That was funny.

433
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:06,052
After having gone on a date with Arman,
do you feel differently about him?

434
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,428
Well...

435
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,723
It's not that I ever thought
he was scary...

436
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,226
but...

437
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,230
he was surprisingly pure and kind of cute.

438
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,523
No way.

439
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:25,988
I haven't been on a date in two years,
but usually I'd get nervous.

440
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,366
I mean, I was at first,
but less than I'd imagined.

441
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,412
He made me comfortable
and I was able to have fun.

442
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,082
I'm glad.

443
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,209
I was so nervous at first, right?

444
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,918
Yeah, in the beginning.

445
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,713
-But you were okay?
-Yeah, I was fine.

446
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,131
I'm glad.

447
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,511
Miraculously, there were two scenes
of hamburgers being made.

448
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,637
Yeah.

449
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,390
Who would've thought?

450
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,060
-The hamburgers connected everything.
-They did.

451
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,729
-Earth.
-Yes, Earth's show.

452
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,023
-It's been awhile.
-Yes, our alumni.

453
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,317
It felt nostalgic.

454
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,611
Reminds me of my days
at the comedy school.

455
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,365
-That's true.
-Yeah.

456
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,285
But if it were me and I knew <i>Terrace House</i>
would be coming to film...

457
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,748
I would've slipped some more jokes
into the conversation.

458
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,292
{\an8}But you know that lady character?

459
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:24,755
{\an8}The joke is that
she's there the entire time... right?

460
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,555
-The humor may have been a bit obscure.
-Yeah, a bit too obscure.

461
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,268
-Maybe like Vincent van Gogh.
-Oh, yes.

462
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,104
So they'll be appreciated after they die.

463
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,609
After watching it for ten minutes,
it's probably funny.

464
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,112
Babachan?

465
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,035
Ten minutes of that?

466
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,080
Babachan!

467
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,749
-They work hard.
-I'm glad to see they're working hard.

468
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,918
-Ippei lost some weight.
-He did.

469
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,129
Momoka...

470
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,547
She's totally into him.

471
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,508
-She is.
-She's having so much fun.

472
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,219
But she needs to concentrate
on her ballet career.

473
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:16,973
It's difficult to tell
how serious Arman is.

474
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,518
-He should've been a magician.
-Totally!

475
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,104
You can't read his emotions at all.

476
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,274
Or maybe a judge?

477
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,775
Like, "You're guilty, right?"

478
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,403
"Guilty."

479
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,658
You're so cold!

480
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:39,080
A lawyer might lose the case the moment
they find out Arman is the judge.

481
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,874
"It'll be a tough battle."

485
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,726
{\an8}-Did they give these out?
-No, I bought them.

486
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,854
I thought we'd only be three people,
so I only bought three.

487
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,232
-They're pretty bright.
-Wow.

488
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,483
I don't get one?

489
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,443
Here you go.

490
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,737
-This is yours.
-You're doing great.

LOOK THIS WAY MISAKI!

492
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,781
-So I don't get one.
-Looking good.

493
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,783
Everyone!

494
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,953
Are you ready to get loud?

495
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,334
Let's go, Ebisu...

497
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,745
She's really looking around.

498
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,174
Here we go!

499
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,989
{\an8}-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

500
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,115
{\an8}Welcome back.

501
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,951
-Welcome back.
-Thanks, everyone.

502
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,786
-You worked hard.
-You did good.

503
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,955
-Did you see us?
-Yes, I saw you.

504
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,041
I was so surprised, it made me laugh.

505
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,918
Yeah, you were smiling

506
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,920
-I was so nervous today.
-Welcome home.

507
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,297
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

508
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,673
-You were nervous?
-Today--

509
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,841
-Can I?
-Oh, sure.

510
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,428
-Everyone told me I was acting weird.
-No way!

511
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,930
-Did you have fun?
-It was so fun!

512
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,933
Riko looked like she was having fun.

513
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,394
-Thanks for coming.
-I was mesmerized.

514
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,770
Thanks.

515
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,774
-I want to see Momochan too.
-Ballet?

516
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,236
-I want to see.
-In June...

517
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,071
around the end...

518
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:22,451
-I decided to enter a competition.
-What kind of competition?

519
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,035
A ballet competition.

520
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,663
-A competition?
-Yeah.

521
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,082
So there are people dancing
the same thing?

522
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:33,504
You dance whatever you're good at
and then there's an evaluation.

523
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,965
-We have to watch.
-We have to check it out.

524
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,136
I need to go work downstairs.

525
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,263
-Okay.
-Okay.

526
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,180
-See ya.
-See ya.

527
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,641
I gotta do laundry.

528
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,142
Me too.

529
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,435
Me too.

530
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,229
The quickest one wins.

531
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,855
So...

532
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,360
I've got the dryer set to very dry now,
so you'll have to wait.

533
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,529
I think I'll tidy up here.

534
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,947
-Only one's open.
-Really?

535
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,366
Rock, paper, scissors.

536
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,492
-I win!
-I win.

537
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,369
I won!

538
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,953
I'll go take care of this.

539
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,294
-Riko, it's just the two of us now.
-I'm off to sleep.

540
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,712
What? Don't go sleep.

541
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,466
So you want to go to Tsukiji?

542
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,386
Don't brush it off.

543
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,179
-Do you want to go?
-I do.

544
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,309
I want to go.
So? What about you?

545
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,686
-I want to go.
-So we'll go?

546
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,895
Yeah.

547
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,230
-We'll go next week.
-I forgot my phone.

548
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,442
-Next week?
-Yeah.

549
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,735
Are you busy next week?

550
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,071
-I might have school.
-Really?

551
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,781
I think.

552
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,950
-Good night.
-Good night.

553
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,076
Good night.

554
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,828
I know you want to go.
