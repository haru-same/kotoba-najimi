1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,056
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,642
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,268
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,021
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,732
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,860
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,781
Last week, Natsumi and Hikaru
left <i>Terrace House</i> and...

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,075
HIKARU OTA, 19 YEARS OLD
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,453
Oh, on my way home from work
the other day...

10
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,958
I was driving in my neighborhood
and I saw Nacchan!

11
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,752
I was like, "Whoa!"

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,546
It turns out she lives really close to me.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,465
Wow, scary.

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,550
No, it's not scary.

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,596
This isn't some horror story.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,808
Since we do this, it's really strange
when we see them in real life.

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,476
It really is.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,188
Yeah, I was on a variety show
with Tetsuya Sugaya.

19
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,690
-Together?
-Yes.

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,734
-How were you together?
-You must be kidding.

21
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,153
We were Team Chiba.

22
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,199
Team Chiba?

23
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,493
It was me, Tetsu and Hideki Takahashi.

24
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,205
-What a line up.
-That's a big name!

25
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,501
So with Tetsu... it went down so badly.

26
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,086
I couldn't talk.

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,506
-Still?
-He doesn't understand personal space.

28
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,844
We're in each other's faces,
and it made the audience uncomfortable.

29
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,975
Every time he made a bad comment,
I would rag on him.

30
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,227
That's terrible!

31
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,563
And Hideki Takahashi would say, "Stop it."

32
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,982
He was scolding you.

33
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,401
He was like, "Stop it,"
with his deep voice.

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,570
-He's a very gentle person.
-Yes.

35
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,407
-Wow.
-Sorry, we've gone off-topic.

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,326
-Sorry to interrupt. Please continue.
-We're sorry.

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,870
-And we have new members.
-We do.

38
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,288
A wonderful person.

39
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,999
-Yes, a ballerina. Momochan.
-Momochan.

40
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,668
I'm a ballerina.

41
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,670
-This?
-Yes, that.

42
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,214
I'm trying to make it my profession.

43
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,968
I'm currently
at a professional training facility,

44
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:20,182
and practicing in order to move up.

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,517
I went to an all-girls high school.

46
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:27,606
-Oh, I see.
-So I'm not sure how to act around men.

47
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,442
-She's like a princess.
-Yes, so pure and innocent.

48
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,154
Yes, pure.
Like all she's ever known is ballet.

49
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,450
-She works part-time at a chocolate shop.
-So cute!

50
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,244
All she's ever done with a man is
dance pas de deux.

51
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,080
-So cute.
-Pas de deux.

52
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,874
And along with this wonderful girl,
we have...

53
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,335
-Don't say it like that.
-Was that bad?

54
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,338
The potential player is here.

55
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,757
Are there any couples here?

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,385
-No, no one.
-No one.

57
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,596
So cupid's arrow might be pointing
in specific directions already?

58
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,099
-What, now? You think?
-Don't you think?

59
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,393
What do you think, Momochan?

60
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,770
-You move quick.
-You're so quick.

61
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,481
-Did I jump the gun?
-He seems like a player.

62
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,316
He's definitely a player.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,445
Tamosan seems a little cautious of him.

64
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,449
-He seems like an aggressive type.
-I wonder if he's gonna come on strong.

65
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,536
-We don't know yet.
-That's true.

66
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,248
And Arman likes the new girl once again.

67
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,127
-Arman likes the feminine type.
-Yes, that's true.

68
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
-What did you think of Momochan, Arman?
-Yeah.

69
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,506
I think she's cute.

70
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,218
-She's in your strike zone?
-We've never had an athlete before.

71
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,637
-That's true.
-So good first impression.

72
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,306
I want Rikochan
to have more of a fun experience!

73
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,476
-Seriously.
-Yeah, nothing's been fun for her.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,437
She's only been a mediator.

75
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,063
-Yeah.
-Poor girl.

76
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,115
-This makes it feel official.
-Yeah, doesn't it?

77
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,992
It makes me nervous.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,623
Cute handwriting.

79
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,708
Hayato.

80
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,837
Okay.

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,132
-I'm going to get ready upstairs.
-Okay.

82
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,217
See you later.

83
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,677
See you later.

84
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,390
-Are you off tomorrow?
-I am.

85
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:30,353
-What are your plans?
-I'll do whatever comes up.

86
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,439
Do you want to go somewhere?

87
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,941
Go somewhere? Sure.

88
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,445
There must be a lot of places
you still haven't seen in Tokyo.

89
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,655
Yeah, I think so.

90
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,199
Where do you want to go?

91
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,451
Hmm, where do I want to go?

92
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,912
Any place you recommend.

93
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,165
-It can be anywhere?
-Yeah, anywhere.

94
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,876
-Then I'll think about it.
-Okay.

95
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,669
-Tomorrow then.
-Tomorrow.

96
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,799
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Okay.

97
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,802

109
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,262
-We're back.
-Welcome home.

110
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,930
-I'm back.
-You scared me.

111
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,515
He's making something.

112
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,476
-You came home together?
-We bumped into each other at the station.

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,478
Oh, wow.

114
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,565
-Are you hungry?
-I am.

115
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:43,028
-I made hayashi rice.
-Thank you.

116
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,031
It looks delicious!
I haven't had hayashi rice in a while.

117
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,532
Really?

118
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,077
I didn't know we had placemats.

119
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,330
This is the first time I'm eating in here.

120
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,791
-Oh, yeah.
-What? You've never eaten in here?

121
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,963
There wasn't anybody here who could cook.

122
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,050
-We'll have a hamburger cooking class.
-Please.

123
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,261
Apparently there's a trick
to cooking them.

124
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,223
Even the color is different.

125
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,018
-Bon appétit.
-Please, enjoy.

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,770
It's hot.

127
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,856
-Tasty.
-Is it?

128
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,984
So good!

129
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,903
-It's so good.
-It is.

130
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

131
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm glad.

132
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,992
Especially since I didn't say
I'd be cooking,

133
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,744
I was afraid you'd have eaten already.

134
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,373
-We would've eaten this even if we had.
-Yeah.

135
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,209
-Thanks.
-It's delicious.

136
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,962
It's restaurant quality.

137
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,423
-Our date is tomorrow.
-Oh, right.

138
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,511
-Nice.
-Or tour of Tokyo anyway.

139
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,221
We're going to the meat festival.

140
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,973
-The meat festival--
-Lucky!

141
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,891
Around noon?

142
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,602
Make sure you're hungry.

143
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,437
-The meat festival sounds nice.
-I'm home.

144
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,815
Welcome back.

145
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,067
-I'm so tired.
-Welcome home.

146
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,487
-Have you eaten?
-Not yet. I'm hungry.

147
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,406
How much can you eat?
I'll bring you some.

148
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,533
-A little bit.
-Just a little?

149
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,867
Did you make a lot?

150
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't worry, it'll keep.
You can eat it tomorrow, too.

151
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,039
-Did you eat?
-Yeah, it was delicious.

152
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,207
It was really good.

153
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,502
-Have you ever had a guy cook for you?
-A guy?

154
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,922
-Like this?
-No, never!

155
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,969
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

156
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,972
Oh, wow! It's like a restaurant.

157
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,559
-He made the roux from scratch.
-What? Wow.

158
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,395
It's delicious.
I need to learn from him.

159
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,691
They're gonna go eat meat.

160
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,694
-Really?
-Yeah, at the meat festival.

161
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,654
Oh, the one on Omotesando?

162
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,614
-Gaienmae.
-Oh, Gaienmae.

163
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,491
The meat festival sounds fun.

164
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,036
I'm gonna google it.

165
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,081
Some famous yakiniku BBQ restaurants
from Tokyo will be there.

166
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,125
-Really?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,918
-Amazing.
-How great is that?

168
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,670
Amazing.

169
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,297
Do you have any performances coming up?

170
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,257
-I do.
-When?

171
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,635
There are two in June and two in July.

172
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,387
So quite often then?

173
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,638
Where?

174
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,601
-In Kyoto and Tokyo.
-Oh, Kyoto...

175
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,061
Near the Tokyo Tower.

176
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,147
-I want to go.
-Yeah.

177
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,901
Really? I'm going to have to practice.

178
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,617
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

179
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,456
-I'm going to have some salad.
-I ate already. Good morning.

180
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,374
-I'm going to have some of your salad.
-Sure.

181
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,051
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

182
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,303
Thanks for waiting.

183
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,305
You're wearing torn jeans, too.

184
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,433
-We're the torn twins.
-Oh, we're twins today.

185
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,561
-Ready to go?
-Yes.

186
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,063
-Really?
-Yeah.

187
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,774
It's gonna be packed.
Seems like it's really crowded already.

188
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,942
-Really?
-Yeah.

189
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,610
-Shall we go then?
-Let's go.

190
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,449
-Did you have breakfast?
-No, not yet.

191
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,409
-What? You must be starving.
-I'm hungry.

00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,543
-It's hot today.
-Yeah.

200
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,462
-And you're hungry?
-And I'm hungry.

201
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,799
-I wonder if we need to wait in lines.
-Probably.

202
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,595
TOKYO MEAT FESTIVAL 2016

203
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,021
-I've already done the research.
-Impressive.

204
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,774
Let's eat meat.

205
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,401
It's not as bad as I thought,

206
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,904
but I guess there'll be lines
at the popular places.

207
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,363
Yeah, there are lines.

208
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,908
-Let's go get gyutan.
-Sounds good.

209
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,200
Welcome!

210
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,370
-Two gyutans please.
-Two orders!

211
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,874
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much!

212
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,044
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

213
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,504
-Which should I eat first?
-The gyutan, of course.

214
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,214
-Here.
-Thank you.

215
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,304
-How is it?
-So good!

216
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,683
-It's delicious.
-It's so good!

217
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,852
-Doesn't it make you want rice?
-Yeah.

218
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,896
-Aren't you hot?
-Yeah.

219
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,944
-This is fun.
-Is it?

220
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,197
-I just happened to be off today.
-Thanks for bringing me!

221
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,951
I start working again tomorrow.

222
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,161
You won't be off for a while?

223
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,373
I have Sunday off, then it's all work.

224
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,711
I have to have some fun while I can.

225
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,967
-How are your nerves doing?
-I'm not nervous anymore.

226
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,178
-You're not?
-I'm not. Are you?

227
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,763
I'm fine.

228
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,974
You're all made-up today.

229
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,059
I thought I'd go for a mature look.

230
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,480
-You look mature.
-That's what I was going for.

231
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,192
-You're 11 years younger than me.
-Eleven.

232
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,112
I'm turning 19 this year,
and you're turning 30.

233
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,408
-How do you feel about that?
-How do I feel?

234
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:09,038
When I was your age,
30 was way too old.

235
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,750
-Yeah, it seems very mature.
-Yeah.

236
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,504
You're an adult, but you look...

237
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,424
-You look young.
-I do look younger.

238
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,093
I must seem like a kid to you.

239
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:27,598
A kid? Well, not quite a kid.
You seem mature and calm.

240
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,270
You don't go for older guys?
You said you usually like guys your age.

241
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,649
I can't see myself dating anyone younger.

242
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,484
Only older?

243
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,576
-Did you have fun?
-It was fun.

244
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,454
Was it really?

245
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,997
It was fun.

246
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,000
-Welcome back.
-I'm home.

247
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,918
I'm home.

248
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,713
-She went to eat meat.
-Oh, I want to hear about it.

249
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,173
How was it?

250
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,800
I didn't feel like
there was an age gap at all.

251
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,138
What will you do if he asks you out again?
Will you go?

252
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,390
-I'd go.
-You would?

253
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,851
Just the two of you?

254
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,937
It didn't feel awkward
for the two of us to be alone.

255
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,440
I see. That's the best.

256
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,860
You could see him as a potential boyfriend
the more you know him.

257
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,821
It's a possibility, right?

258
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,532
-Yeah, but it's a little scary.
-Scary?

259
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:32,538
To fall for someone 11 years older
would be a little scary.

260
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,833
-Because they're experienced?
-It's scary.

261
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,545
I've only ever dated guys my own age.

262
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,256
I like experiencing things together.

263
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,385
Like going somewhere
for the first time together.

264
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,804
So you want to experience
your firsts together.

265
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,930
Yeah, I think so.

266
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,557
Like places you've both never been?

267
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,144
-I'm sure that won't be the case with him.
-You never know.

268
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,898
I've never been on a date
at the aquarium or the zoo.

269
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,192
-I'm sure he has.
-I haven't either.

270
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,236
That's so cute.

271
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,447
But going together for the first time
is a different experience

272
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,825
from going with someone
who's already been.

273
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,370
They can show you what's fun.

274
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,122
That's not what I want.

275
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,748
You want to experience it together?

276
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,043
That's probably
why I've avoided dating older guys.

277
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:26,884
For example, going to Disneyland
after he'd gone with an ex.

278
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,511
I'd hate that.

279
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,015
-You don't think so?
-There was a time when I did.

280
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,101
But it's a little tough.

281
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,062
Yeah, I know.

282
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,232
-So cute.
-The meat festival.

283
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,361
What a great event to go to on a nice day.

284
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:50,158
When I was 18, I was dating a 38-year-old.

285
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,078
-Here she comes out of left field.
-From left field?

286
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,915
So experiencing firsts together
was impossible.

287
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,878
So I did have a similar experience.

288
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,382
Like, "Let's go here
because it's really beautiful.

289
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,177
Oh, another place he's been already!"

290
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,430
So there was a little bit of that feeling.

291
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,806
A little jealousy then?

292
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,895
That too, but there was the desire

293
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,148
to experience together
a place he hadn't seen yet.

294
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,984
I haven't thought about it for ten years
until now.

295
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,112
But I totally remember now.

296
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,618
Tamosan's condescending tone
towards Terashima is coming out.

297
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,454
-It's interesting.
-"Did you really have fun?"

298
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,415
She's like the older sister
trying to make sure Riko's okay.

299
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,625
So she's just worried.

300
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,085
"If he asks you out again, would you go?"

301
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,131
It's like she's saying
she should re-think things.

302
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,926
He must really be unappealing in her eyes.

303
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:57,642
But if things continue this way,
Rikochan may fall for him.

304
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,560
Do you think so?

305
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,104
It'd be nice to see her get
a little more emotional.

306
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:08,319
She did get emotional when Tamosan said,
"An older guy can show you what's fun."

307
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,197
She said, "That's not what I want!"

308
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,450
-She did say that.
-She shot that down!

309
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,328
-That's true.
-She was emotional in that moment.

310
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,372
It's like it came from
another scene or something.

311
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,831
"It's not that!"

312
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,544
So things are getting
a little more emotional.

313
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,088
I think it's good.

-Yeah, I'm having fun.

319
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,940
Nice.

320
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,150
I went on a date yesterday.

321
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,443

-Yeah.

-That was quick.
-It is, isn't it?

324
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,323
We went to the meat festival.

325
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,660
Nice! You've never had
that kind of opportunity before, right?

326
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,079
I'm not close with anyone younger than me.

327
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,872
I see.

328
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,917
-So it's refreshing for you.
-That's what's fun about it.

329
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,504
I cooked dinner for them.

330
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,089
-Already?
-Yeah.

331
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,424
You move so fast.

332
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,175
Everyone comes home at different times.

333
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,596
-What'd you make?
-Something easy to heat up. Hayashi rice.

334
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,763
Nice.

335
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,683
To cook something for others
which you usually make for yourself

336
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,934
can be stressful.

337
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,978
-It is a little nerve-wracking.
-You can't slack off.

338
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,774
It's good to have a change in environment
and to enjoy life.

339
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,693
Yes, I'm having fun.

340
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,404
I'm sure there's something to gain there.

341
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,490
OMOTESANDO, TOKYO

342
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,915
Once again, welcome to <i>Terrace House</i>.

343
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,629
-So, cheers!
-Cheers!

344
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,089
Cheers.

345
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,261
-Thank you for doing this.
-Thank you.

346
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,429
You're welcome.

347
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,514
Momoka, it's almost your birthday, right?

348
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,768
-You're turning 21?
-Yes.

349
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,770
We'll have to celebrate.

350
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,441
-Wow!
-It looks so tasty.

351
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,820
Momochan hasn't gone out with anyone yet.

352
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,030
-That's true.
-No, I haven't!

353
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,659
-You were busy this week.
-Yes, I was running around all week.

354
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,786
I really want to go to a comedy show.

355
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,330
-I want to go.
-Really?

356
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,416
-Sounds fun. Let's go sometime.
-Yeah, let's go.

357
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,294
I know a comedian.

358
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,879
-Really?
-Yeah. Wanna go?

359
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,173
-I do, I want to go.
-Yeah, let's go.

360
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,343
-Which comedian?
-He works at the gym.

361
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,470
-His name is Ippei.
-Ippei?

362
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,681
The guy from the comedy duo Earth?

363
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,015
-I know him.
-He was on this show.

364
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,475
-On <i>Terrace House</i>?
-Yeah.

365
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,644
His comedy is always
about the American model Caiya.

366
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,062
-Caiya? Who's that?
-Caiya.

367
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,565
-Oh, an impersonation of her?
-I like it.

368
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,067
It's entertaining.

369
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,735
So, Hayato...

370
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:00,282
you were an actor at one point?

371
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,868
I was, or I was trying to be.

372
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,871
Can I ask why you quit?

373
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,166
I had already decided
when I came to Tokyo

374
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,961
that I'd quit if I hadn't made it
by the time I turned 30.

375
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,505
How old were you when you came to Tokyo?

376
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,048
I was 21.

377
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,261
That transition...

378
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,931
Yeah, it's difficult.
It's frustrating.

379
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,060
If it's so frustrating,
why wouldn't you keep trying?

380
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,898
I get the feeling
that a part of you still wants to.

381
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,818
Well, I've already made the decision.

382
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,862
Me too.

383
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:42,074
I'll probably retire from ballet
after turning 30.

384
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,285
Most likely.

385
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:49,290
The time to quit will come someday.

386
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,168
Listening to you
made me think about my own timing.

387
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,505
So you quit because you gave up?

388
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,257
Yeah.

389
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,385
If it were me...

390
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,887
that would really be...

391
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,056
frustrating for me, I think.

392
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,769
Yeah, well, sure.

393
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,771
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

394
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,445
Oh, man.

395
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,742
I don't know. It really...

396
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,537
took determination.

397
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,333
It really takes courage...

398
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,461
when you experience
your first big failure.

399
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:41,300
Things had gone pretty well up until then,
but I accepted my defeat.

400
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,552
Of course it's frustrating.

401
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,930
I don't think you have to give up.

402
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,766
I've already decided.

403
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:57,441
I think it's good to know when to give up.

404
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,778
-Letting go is important too.
-Yeah.

405
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,864
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,452
I don't mean to be a downer.

407
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,205
Thank you for telling us.

408
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,750
I truly believe it takes courage
to say what you really think.

409
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,629
SHIBUYA, TOKYO

410
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,438
I've always liked Shibuya 109.

411
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,567
I come to SBY often.

412
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,028
I was in customer service for three years
in my hometown.

413
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,574
-I hope to put that experience to use.
-Right.

414
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,033
YASUHA ITO
MANAGER

415
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:54,373
If you were hired,
what would your availability be like?

416
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:59,795
I'd like to work
at least two to three days a week.

417
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,049
Is there something in particular
you think you can do

418
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,511
if you worked here?

419
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,638
Something I can do?

420
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,393
Like, something you're especially good at?

421
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,978
What I'm good at?

422
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,942
What I'm good at...

423
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,074
I'm hoping to figure out what I'm good at.

424
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,909
Thank you.

425
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,372
I'm back.

426
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,416
-Welcome back.
-Are you alone, Riko?

427
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,876
Yeah.

428
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,837
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

429
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,298
Thanks.

430
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,635
-How was your day?
-I had an interview for a part-time job.

431
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,762
-That's right! At SBY?
-Yeah.

432
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,764
-Did you get it?
-I don't know yet.

433
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,390
Oh, I see.

434
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,852
-If you get it, I'll come visit.
-Yeah.

435
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,021
I might not get it though.

436
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,898
It'll be fine.

437
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:06,820
She asked me what I'm good at...

438
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,574
and I couldn't think of anything.

439
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,952
I don't think I know myself that well.

440
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:20,167
It's difficult to know your strengths.

441
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,297
I don't think I know my strengths either.

442
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,509
It made me realize
that I should really think about it.

443
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,136
Otherwise, I won't know.

444
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,181
I hope you'll be able to find it here
at <i>Terrace House</i>.

445
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,474
Yeah.

446
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,269
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

447
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,522
Welcome back.

448
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,108
-You're home.
-Welcome back.

449
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,861
You guys were talking so quietly.

450
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,656
It was a serious conversation.

451
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:55,369
-How was your day, Misaki?
-I had a meeting today.

452
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,496
-I'm exhausted.
-You seem tired.

453
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,167
It's so difficult to sell yourself.

454
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,337
-We were just talking about that.
-Oh, really?

455
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,089
-No way.
-How'd you know?

456
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,216
-I didn't. I didn't hear.
-How scary.

457
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,720
-I felt that way after my meeting today.
-Really?

458
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,763
What did you say today?

459
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:19,685
I said I didn't know my strengths
and I'd like to figure out what they are.

460
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,980
-It's very positive.
-Yeah.

461
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,273
I think it's good.

462
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,658
-Hold on. We need the lights.
-Oh, it's warm today!

463
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,494
Wow!

464
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,455
It's so pretty.

465
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,331
-Wow!
-It's definitely cold.

466
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,583
-It's warm.
-No way.

467
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,877
Yeah, it's nice.
It was cold yesterday.

468
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,254
-We can totally get in.
-Seriously?

469
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,214
-You're going in?
-Totally.

470
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,424
It was cold yesterday.

471
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,342
-Do you have swim trunks?
-I do.

472
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,719
I'm gonna go buy some.

473
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,972
You could go naked in the morning.

474
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,724
Maybe not a good idea.

475
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,310
Misaki is gonna hate me more.

476
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,271
Don't worry.

477
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,692
-Has anyone swum here before?
-Arman was the first.

478
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,570
The first?

479
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,072
It looked like it felt nice.

480
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,162
No way!

481
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,960
Thank you! I'm so surprised.

482
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,423
Thank you!

483
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,051
Thank you!

484
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,011
-Can I?
-Of course, go ahead.

485
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,308
Whoops!

486
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:45,270
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you. Thank you.

487
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,398
-I'm so happy.
-Twenty-one years old.

488
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,609
I'm super happy.

489
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,861
-Shall we eat over there?
-Yeah.

490
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,326
-It's not over yet.
-Don't turn around.

491
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,912
From Handa...

492
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,498
a gift!

493
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,668
-Really? Thank you!
-Happy birthday.

494
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,753
-Let's keep it going.
-Yeah.

495
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,463
Bring it on.

496
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,965
-Keep it coming.
-Wait, wait.

497
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,342
-We all have gifts.
-What? Really?

498
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,468
This is from me.

499
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,054
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

500
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,639
Thank you so much.

501
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,559
-There's more coming.
-Wait a sec.

502
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,854
-This one's from me.
-Thank you!

503
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,772
Wow, I'm so happy.

504
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,984
-Happy birthday, Momochan.
-Thank you!

505
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,069
What am I gonna do with all this?

506
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,404
-Happy birthday.
-It's big.

507
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,364
Thank you.
What should I do?

508
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,366
-Why don't you open them in order?
-Right, in order.

509
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,119
-It's so cute!
-Isn't it?

510
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,662
I hope it looks good on me.

511
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,956
-It's so cute.
-I totally thought it's you.

512
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,500
-Is Arman's next?
-Arman's is next.

513
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,712
-What's this?
-What's that?

514
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,672
A planetarium.

515
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,007
Oh, I see.

516
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,637
-What was that?
-The receipt.

517
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,639
-Wow!
-Oh!

518
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,977
-Oh, you can use it in the tub.
-I'm glad I spotted it.

519
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,812
Wow!

520
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:12,107
-Yeah, you can use it in the bath.
-The bath is spacious. It'd be perfect.

521
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,735
-You can use that in the bath?
-Yeah.

522
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,155
You're always tired after your lessons.

523
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,866
Are you on the top bunk?

524
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,993
-I'm on top.
-Oh, that's perfect then.

525
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,329
-Nice.
-Thank you.

526
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,623
Should we all go in the pool?

527
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,250
You just want to go in.

528
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,336
-You're welcome to.
-No one else is going to?

529
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,795
-We'll watch you.
-I'm gonna go in then.

530
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,464
-Go ahead.
-It's hot.

531
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,886
It's been so happy in the house this week,
with the party and all.

532
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,556
The weather's nice,
and they had the birthday party...

533
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,558
-It's so warm.
-It's so peaceful.

534
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,101
So peaceful.

535
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,063
-They had the welcome dinner.
-Yes, the welcome dinner.

536
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,273
They said they'd go see the comedy show.

537
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,485
-I'm sure we'll be seeing Earth.
-Oh, yes, Earth.

538
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,613
I wonder if they're still doing
Maki Ohguro's impersonation.

539
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,156
I wonder.

540
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,369
They were talking about that,
but then you look over at Hayato--

541
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,536
Yeah, Hayato...

542
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,832
-Tamosan was really pushing him.
-She really was.

543
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,503
-It's like Fuyumi took over.
-Yeah.

544
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,213
Did Nacchan leave Fuyumi behind?

545
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,216
-That'd be too evil.
-Yeah.

546
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,303
The next day he mentioned
how he didn't want to be hated anymore.

547
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,682
He's already picked up
that she doesn't like him.

548
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,393
But seeing him cry
made me like him a little.

549
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,895
-Oh, good.
-I don't mean like in that way.

550
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,942
-Torichan...
-He was so honest.

551
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,362
-You got a glimpse of that part of him.
-And he never wavered.

552
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,741
He clearly said
he made his decision to quit.

553
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,245
-It was very cool of him.
-That's true.

554
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,455
Especially since he seemed
so superficial at first.

555
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,957
Yes.

556
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,043
And Arman gave a planetarium as a gift.

557
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,629
The planetarium...

558
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:04,594
it's really just a toy that you might get
in high school or something.

559
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:09,891
But he says it's so she can relax
in the tub when she comes home tired.

560
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,562
-That reasoning might move Momoka.
-I see.

561
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,814
-That's true.
-It's not bad.

562
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:20,277
"Arman, can you see stars like this
from where you live in Hawaii?"

563
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,279
"Yeah, you can."

564
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,323
"We can pas de deux
under the stars in Hawaii."

565
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,581
-All together.
-Yeah, all together.

566
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,916
-Ready? Three, two, one.
-I'm scared!

567
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,840
Nice.

568
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,635
-It was cold yesterday.
-It's not too bad now.

569
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,137
No way.

570
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,360
It's cold!

571
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,030
-You're getting out?
-I'm done.

572
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,410
That was quick.

573
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,915
-Summer's here.
-Yeah.

574
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,959
I've been here six months,
and this is my first time in.

575
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,713
I'm awake now.
I'm going in.

576
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,675
-Good night.
-Good night.

577
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,073
Hey there.

578
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,992
-Can I come sit next to you?
-Sure.

579
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,702
It's cold.

580
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,788
-It's so nice.
-Yeah.

581
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,000
-I do want to go in.
-You should. Maybe during the day.

582
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,045
Yeah, maybe if it's during the day.

583
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,006
You mentioned
you wanted to see a comedy show.

584
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:11,012
Ippei said there's something next Sunday.

585
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,514
-Really?
-Yeah, so if you're free...

586
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,558
-The 22nd?
-Yeah, the 22nd.

587
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,977
-I'm free.
-You are? Let's go.

588
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,353
I'm looking forward to it.

589
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,355
-I'll find out what time it starts.
-Okay.

590
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,566
I love comedy.

591
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,110
We're not going to the beach?

592
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,071
-We'll do the beach next time.
-Next time? Okay.
