1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,684
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,310
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,063
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,523
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,901
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,528
Last week...

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,030
-Finally, Rikopin...
-That's right!

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,074
-...and Hayato...
-Right!

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,535
-...agreed to go to Tsukiji Market.
-A Tsukiji date!

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,411
First they ate meat together,
now they'll eat fish.

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,873
{\an8}Have you ever been...
to Tsukiji Market?

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,334
{\an8}-No.
-Then let's go to Tsukiji.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,129
{\an8}-It's funny.
-What's funny?

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,465
{\an8}That you're interested in an 18-year-old.

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,468
{\an8}She seems flattered.
She says, "It's funny."

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,178
{\an8}-Totally!
-"You're interested in a girl

18
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,556
{\an8}11 years younger than you.
That's funny."

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,059
{\an8}-We're getting good vibes from Hayato.
-Yeah!

20
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,186
{\an8}<i>He taught Misaki how to make hamburgers.</i>

21
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,856
{\an8}I can't pick on him like I used to.

22
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,485
{\an8}Arman and Momoka went
to Earth's live show.

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,697
{\an8}<i>-Oh yeah, that's right!</i>
<i>-They did.</i>

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,450
{\an8}I thought she was applauding...
but she's forming a hamburger patty!

25
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,035
{\an8}I'm seriously scared!

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,414
{\an8}That was about how forming hamburgers
can seem like clapping.

27
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,878
Coincidentally, Hayato taught Misaki
how to make hamburgers.

28
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,963
That's why hamburgers were
such a hot topic.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:34,344
Momoka seems quite smitten with Arman,
don't you think?

30
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,306
He was surprisingly pure and kind of cute.

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,557
No way.

32
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:43,603
I mean, I was nervous first,
but less than I'd imagined.

33
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,981
He made me comfortable
and I was able to have fun.

34
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,985
Rikopin and Hayato are sort of a couple.

35
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,112
-Then there's Momoka and Arman.
-Yeah.

36
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,990
There are two promising couples,
so this should be interesting.

37
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,491
Sure.

38
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,620
-You go, daddy!
-I approve!

39
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,163
Yeah, daddy!

40
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,374
{\an8}Did you jump in the pool with Arman
the other day?

41
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,501
{\an8}-No.
-Why not?

42
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,296
Because...

43
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,382
-being in the pool with a guy...
-Why not?

44
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,302
-Girls get nervous, huh?
-Obviously.

45
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,512
Guys don't?

46
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,724
-Not really.
-Seriously?

47
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,559
-Why would I be?
-We're talking about a pool.

48
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,853
First of all, I've never been to a pool
with a guy before.

49
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,396
-Seriously?
-I'm serious.

50
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,859
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

51
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,654
-Hey!
-Hey.

52
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,072
Won't be home today. Crunch time!
-Han

53
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,615
-We haven't seen Hansan lately.
-That's true.

54
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,828
-He wasn't here yesterday either.
-Right.

55
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,871
He's busy right now.

56
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,021
Remember when you both came down earlier?

57
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,273
I was so glad.

58
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,984
Why?

59
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,569
I'm not used to being alone with a guy.

60
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,446
So...

61
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,949
I wasn't sure what to talk about.

62
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,034
-With Hayato?
-Yeah.

63
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,704
-But you were okay with Arman, right?
-Yeah.

64
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:29,501
It seems to me
like you're opening up more to Arman.

65
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,964
Think about it.
You're so nervous around any other guy,

66
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,341
but you're totally fine around Arman.

67
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,093
I think that's a big deal.

68
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,138
Arman's a guy,
but you're comfortable around him.

69
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,724
You should go out with him again.

70
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,853
But I can't really ask him out.

71
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,646
Didn't you say
you'd go to the beach together?

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,606
-Yeah.
-The beach?

73
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,609
Should I ask him
to take me to the beach?

74
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,280
Yeah, you should tell him,
"You said we would, remember?"

75
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,202
I'll try to find a good time.
I'll try.

76
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,224
How was it with Momochan?

77
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,893
{\an8}-Oh, right.
-I've been curious.

78
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,937
{\an8}-Oh, yeah?
-But I couldn't ask.

79
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,022
{\an8}-It was fun.
-Yeah, you had fun?

80
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,523
What about the beach?

81
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,233
-The beach?
-You don't remember, do you?

82
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,903
I do.
That's gonna happen.

83
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,363
I'm planning on going
after I get back from Hong Kong.

84
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,826
-What's in Hong Kong?
-My friend's wedding.

85
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,036
-Cool.
-I'm going to Hong Kong and Macau.

86
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,081
-That's cool.
-I'm planning on asking her after that.

87
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,834
You should totally show her
your surfing skills.

88
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,418
-That's a good idea.
-Right?

89
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,755
Momochan gets nervous around guys,
even if it's just chatting.

90
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,551
But with you... she said she's fine.

91
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,011
-Oh, really?
-That's what she said.

92
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,974
But that's happened to me before.
Girls tell me I'm easy to talk to.

93
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,976
Ever since then...

94
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,772
I mean, that means I'm like a brother.
I've been kind of worried about that.

95
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,830
-Hey!
-What's up?

96
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,331
-May I come in?
-Sure.

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
Let's go to the beach sometime.

98
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,630
-Okay.
-Will you take me?

99
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,132
Sure.

100
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,217
-Okay, please take me.
-It's a deal.

101
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,802
-We talked about it before.
-Yeah, that's right.

102
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,429
-You're leaving tomorrow, right?
-Yup.

103
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,141
-To Hong Kong?
-Let's go to the beach next week.

104
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,559
-On Sunday please, if you can.
-Okay, deal.

105
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,478
-I'll make myself available.
-Yeah, you'd do that?

106
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,438
-Okay, cool. Thanks.
-Sure.

107
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,565
-Bye. Good night.
-Good night.

Wow, this is amazing.

Now that you've seen
so many ingredients...

148
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,002
have you been inspired
for what you want to cook?

149
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,920
Totally. I'm super excited.

150
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,213
You were intense.

151
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,257
-Was I too excited?
-Totally.

152
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,676
-But isn't it amazing?
-You were engrossed in your own world.

153
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,303
Oh, really?

154
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,804
You can totally join in.

155
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,681
Thanks, but no thanks.

156
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,726
You know, the other housemates...

157
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,063
like, the other girls...

158
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,605
do you go out with them?

159
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,026
-Should I?
-What?

160
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,402
Do you want me to?

161
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,406
I was just wondering if you were going to.

162
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,451
I'm not really planning on it.

163
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,040
-But I did make hamburgers with Misaki.
-How was it?

164
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,833
-Hmm?
-Did you chat?

165
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,626
Yeah, sure.

166
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,380
-Excuse me. That'll be 5,000 yen.
-Yes.

167
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,133
-I've got exact change. Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

168
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,385
It was delicious.

169
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,804
-Shall we?
-Let's.

170
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,057
Off to find more ingredients.

171
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,143
{\an8}GAIENMAE, TOKYO

172
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,066
{\an8}I'll make it like an assortment here.

173
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,400
{\an8}JUNTA ISHIKAWA
OWNER AND CHEF

174
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,819
{\an8}-It should be set up individually tonight.
-Got it.

175
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,369
-I went to Tsukiji this morning.
-With how many others?

176
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,912
-It was a date.
-Really?

177
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,789
-Did you hold hands?
-No.

178
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,585
-Not yet--
-Is that really a date?

179
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,171
-Or is just more like lunch?
-I'm not sure.

180
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,216
-I wouldn't really call it a date.
-Really?

181
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,885
-When's the next time you're going out?
-Don't know yet.

182
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,678
We didn't make more plans
the last time either.

183
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,931
-You're a bit of a shy boy, aren't you?
-You think so?

184
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:04,020
Dates aren't a big deal.
You're way too nervous.

185
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,360
{\an8}So... I asked him.

186
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,365
I asked him about you guys...

187
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,201
and whether he wants
to go out with either of you.

188
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,995
I don't know what he's thinking.

189
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,958
I think he totally just wants you
right now, so...

190
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,170
I totally agree.

191
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,923
-He never asked either of us out.
-Yeah, exactly!

192
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,967
But you cooked with him.

193
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,012
I didn't know much about him then.

194
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,931
Also, I asked him to help.

195
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,267
I see.

196
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,562
-It's Hansan.
-I'm home.

197
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,356
-Welcome home.
-Having girl talk, are we?

198
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,899
-Are you tired?
-Hmm?

199
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,653
-No, not at all!
-Liar.

200
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,824
-He's exhausted.
-He really is.

201
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,660
-It's this Sunday, isn't it?
-That's right. It's so soon.

202
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,037
-Yeah.
-It's in two days.

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,582
Yeah, I've already set everything up.

204
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,501
What is it for again?

205
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,713
It's called a graduation design.

206
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,218
I have to design an architectural piece
in order to graduate.

207
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,677
To graduate from university?

208
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,221
Yes, every architecture university
does it.

209
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,474
Two students from each university in Tokyo
get chosen for this.

210
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,476
And you're one of them?

211
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,394
Yeah, from the University of the Arts.

212
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,021
-That's amazing!
-Thanks.

213
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,483
It's a competition
that takes place in Tokyo.

214
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:36,571
The piece that we designed
is being assessed right now.

215
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,824
So I have to do a presentation for that.

216
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:44,246
So if you win in that competition,
the next step is national?

217
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,291
Exactly. I'll kind of be competing
at a national level.

218
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,294
-I'll come if I can.
-Great.

219
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,088
-I wanna come, too.
-It's super small.

220
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,594
-Riko and Hayato went to Tsukiji today.
-Oh, you finally went!

221
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,637
-Today?
-Yeah, we did.

222
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,973
-It was raining.
-Yeah, it was.

223
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,934
It was so crowded too.

224
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,896
Weather was bad,
and there were lots of people...

225
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,230
but?

226
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,149
It was fun.

227
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,654
{\an8}I see.
I'm happy for you.

228
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,158
{\an8}I want a new bathing suit.

229
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,744
Yeah, me too.
I need to get one.

230
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,871
The grey one's cute.

231
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,791
I always end up wearing black.

232
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,083
-Yes?
-Yes?

233
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,545
-May I come in?
-Wow.

234
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,632
-Did you change your hair?
-Yeah, I went on a date today.

235
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,302
-Oh, I see.
-I get it.

236
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,012
-Can I sit here?
-How about over there?

237
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,096
-There?
- Yup.

238
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,516
-You're too close.
-Okay.

239
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,602
Did you say "You're too close"?

240
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,980
I came to ask Riko out again.

241
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,192
-What?
-What will you do?

242
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,653
-It's all right.
-What? Why? No!

243
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,862
-What?
-Hmm?

244
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,031
-Don't ask me!
-I can't?

245
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,826
It's summer.
Let's go somewhere.

246
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,077
Is that okay?

247
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,162
-Yeah, okay.
-Really?

248
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,459
The lady has spoken. Goodbye!

249
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,251
All right, I'll think of some place to go.

250
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,463
Okay, let's talk about it.

251
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,549
All right then. See you later.

252
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,468
-Bye.
-Bye.

253
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,308
-What's the matter?
-Hmm?

254
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,768
Riko?

255
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,438
Does that mean he had a good time today?

256
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,732
-Of course.
-That's why he asked.

257
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,316
Are you happy?

258
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,193
Yeah, I'm happy.

259
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,571
Have fun!

260
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,825
-Riko totally panicked.
-Totally.

261
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,952
It's been a while
since a couple has formed.

262
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,328
-I know!
-I know!

263
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,830
-How nice.
-Agreed.

264
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,874
-They're practically together.
-You think so?

265
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,960
Do you think they might be
together by the end of the week?

266
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,296
It's up to Hayato now.

267
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,385
It depends on how things go
when Hayato acts more masculine,

268
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,053
-and how Riko reacts.
-I see, I see.

269
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,975
Will Riko reject Hayato
when he shows his masculine side?

270
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,645
Or is she going to be able to accept him?

271
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:17,565
I feel like she might be scared
if he comes onto her with hungry eyes.

272
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,861
And let's not forget,
Hansan is super cool this episode.

273
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,987
Yes, Hansan!

274
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,409
When he got home,
everyone could see how tired he was.

275
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,536
-He pulled an all-nighter.
-Exactly. "Are you tired?"

276
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,122
"No, not at all!"
The way he stretched out on the couch...

277
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,417
If I were his girlfriend,
I'd want to squeeze him!

278
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,377
-He's so cute!
-Right?

279
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,879
I'd cook everything I know for him.

280
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,677
And then Riko said, "But it was raining,
and it was crowded..."

281
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,887
And as he listens...

282
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,640
"It was raining, it was crowded... but?"

283
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,349
Yeah, the "but"!

284
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,269
The way he said that was so cute!

285
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,939
I'd strip his pants off right there!

286
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,149
Time out!

287
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,444
Time out!

288
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,657
-Mommy went crazy.
-He's just too cute.

289
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,161
-No, you can't.
-But I just cooked him a fabulous meal.

290
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,414
Hey, that has nothing to do with it.

291
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,417
She's dangerous!

292
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,421
{\an8}TAMACHI, TOKYO

{\an8}TOKYO STUDENTS
GRADUATION DESIGN CONTEST 2016

296
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,449
There he is!

297
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,493
-Hey.
-Where? Oh, Hansan!

298
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:57,665
Thanks you guys for coming.
This is it right here.

299
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,166
What is it exactly?

300
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,795
My design is for building facilities
for physically disabled people.

301
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,172
You see this model right here?

302
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,635
It's Harajuku at 1/500 scale.

303
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,720
It's at the end of Cat Street.

304
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,391
There actually are facilities
for physically disabled people there.

305
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,059
My design is a reconstructive idea.

306
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,479
I'm suggesting to open these up
to the public.

307
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,814
-You don't usually visit them, right?
-No.

308
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:26,068
I've proposed an idea to open these up.

309
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,364
There are going to be
nice fashion stores in these spaces.

310
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,408
-Oh, that's cool.
-You see?

311
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,412
Because these facilities will allow people
from the inside and outside to mingle.

312
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,123
When you think about creating
a new Harajuku,

313
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,543
I think facilities like this one
are necessary.

314
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,878
That's my idea.

315
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,630
-You came up with this?
-I did.

316
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,258
-I didn't end up winning, unfortunately.
-Oh, no!

317
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,930
Anyways, everything I've done as a student
has culminated in today.

318
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,181
I see.

319
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,474
-Good job!
-Good job!

320
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,976
Really good job.

321
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,229
It'd be awesome if they build
something like this in Harajuku.

322
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,233
I'd brag about you.

323
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,821
Just you wait.
Someday my designs will be out there.

324
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,329
{\an8}What do I do if I screw this up?
I've never made it before.

325
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,290
-I'm sure Hansan will laugh it off.
-True.

326
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,550
-Wow, awesome!
-Does this look right?

327
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,219
-Paella is supposed to be dry, right?
-Yeah.

328
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,476
-I'm home.
-Welcome home!

329
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,561
What's this?

330
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,273
It's for you.

331
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:50,361
Hayato made these, didn't he?
Right?

332
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,239
-Wow! Really?
-We did.

333
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,783
That's amazing.

334
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,952
-Want a beer?
-Yeah.

335
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,204
Wow, thanks!

336
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,498
"Good job, Hansan."

337
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,502
{\an8}Misaki did all that.

338
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,629
{\an8}Thank you.

339
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,422
I can't guarantee that it tastes good.

340
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,510
This is great.
It smells so good.

341
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,307
Delicious.

342
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,351
-Really?
-Yay, Riko!

343
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,312
-Thanks! Have as much as you like.
-What is it?

344
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,523
Takikomi rice?

345
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,526
Wait, what's it supposed to be?
It's delicious.

346
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,362
-Well...
-This is actually paella.

347
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,322
Oh, seriously?

348
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,911
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

349
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,914
No worries.
From now on, this is takikomi rice.

350
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,167
Have you cleared everything up
at the contest?

351
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,419
Yup. I wasn't able to wow them though.

352
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,171
-What?
-The judges.

353
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,380
Right.

354
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,508
But to us, you're number one.

355
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,760
Yup.

356
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,262
Thanks, guys.

357
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,516
Sometimes doing my best is not enough.

358
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,269
I have to get credited somehow.

359
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,273
That's the only way in architecture.

360
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,526
You won't get paid
unless you're number one.

361
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,321
Because there's only going to be
one building.

362
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,323
So I've got to be number one.

363
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,534
Someday... I will be.

364
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,036
You will be.

365
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,915
What's next for you?

366
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,585
Well, I should put everything together
into a portfolio...

367
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,672
-and prepare to study abroad.
-Okay.

368
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,299
Will you be going to university abroad?

369
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,801
-Grad school.
-Right.

370
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,181
Well, I'm glad we were able to do this
for you tonight.

371
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,599
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

372
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,268
-You always work so hard.
-Exactly.

373
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,937
Thank you.

374
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,023
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

375
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,281
{\an8}Thank you!

376
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,491
{\an8}PICK UP HERE!

377
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,994
Here you go.

378
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,582
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

379
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,338
-How was it?
-I was more nervous than I thought I'd be.

380
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,091
{\an8}Just remember, smile and be cheerful.

381
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,342
{\an8}YASUHA ITO
MANAGER

382
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,761
{\an8}Also, speak a bit louder.

383
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,928
Okay.

384
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,723
-If you do that, you're good.
-Okay.

385
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,518
And how are things lately?

386
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,937
-At <i>Terrace House?</i>
-Yeah.

387
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,731
Are you having fun?

388
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,524
Yeah, I am.

389
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,067
Does everyone get along?

390
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,320
In the past, some previous members
had fights.

391
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,989
But there aren't any right now.

392
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,698
How's your love life?

393
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,327
Well, I went on two dates with a guy.

394
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,996
Oh, yeah?

395
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:52,043
I like him,
but I don't know if I like-like him yet.

396
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:56,088
Well... he's 11 years older.

397
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,174
Hey, that's cool.

398
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,759
What do you think about that?

399
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,344
-I'm totally okay with it.
-Really?

400
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,513
Take my parents, for example.

401
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,766
My dad's 11 years older
than my mom.

402
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,811
Wow, really?

403
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,647
-I think it's more common now.
-You think so?

404
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,985
That changes things for me.

405
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,361
Is he cute?

406
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,488
I think he is.

407
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:26,118
So you don't know if you like him yet,
but are you willing to give it a chance?

408
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,120
I think so.

409
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,122
He asked me out for a third date.

410
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,126
-I'm definitely nervous.
-Aw, I'm jealous!

411
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,932
Oh, hey, Hansan.

412
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,141
What are you doing?

413
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,477
I'm making marinated peppers.

414
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,270
-A pepper?
-Marinated pepper.

415
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,439
A friend of mine runs
a barbecue restaurant.

416
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,193
-He asked me to think of an appetizer.
-Oh, cool.

417
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,197
-Aren't you drinking tonight?
-Once I'm done, I will.

418
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,993
-I need to submit a quote today.
-Oh, I see.

419
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,036
I'd love for you to help
with the interior design

420
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,205
-once I have my own restaurant.
-Totally.

421
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,582
Your future restaurant, right?
A pasta specialty restaurant?

422
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,292
Yeah, exactly.

423
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,754
You wanted the interior
to look like a burger joint.

424
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,882
-That's what you said, right?
-Yup.

425
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,218
And also to have the feel of a resort.

426
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:29,056
That's cool. It'd be fun to design it
because you don't see anything like it.

427
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,641
Exactly.

428
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,811
-Welcome home.
-Thanks.

429
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,982
-What are you doing?
-I'm browning the pepper.

430
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,984
-I'm not playing.
-It looks like it.

431
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,318
Well, I'm not.

432
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,071
-Are you working, Hansan?
-Yes.

433
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,951
I only have about 40 minutes
until I have to send it in.

434
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm pretty screwed.

435
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,415
-You are.
-That thing you're working on now?

436
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,292
I'm gonna have to seriously tackle this.

437
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,045
-Good luck.
-I've got 42 minutes.

438
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,923
-Come get me when the peppers are done.
-Okay.

439
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,636
-So...
-Yeah?

440
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,598
-About our date.
-Uh-huh.

441
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,769
-I thought about it, and I googled it too.
-Cool, thanks.

442
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:20,566
The thing is,
I don't know much about dates.

443
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,818
So I couldn't figure out
a good place to go.

444
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,822
So I'm a little stuck.

445
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,990
I see.

446
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,951
Out of curiosity, what did you search?

447
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,618
Just...

448
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,958
-I just googled "date."
-That's good.

449
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,293
-And what did you find?
-There were too many things.

450
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,962
I'm totally confused.

451
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,172
So what should we do?

452
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,343
What did we decide
with regards to Yokohama?

453
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,636
-What?
-Yokohama.

454
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,014
Remember when we first talked
about Yokohama?

455
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,807
What about Yokohama?

456
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,684
What's in Yokohama anyway?

457
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,561
The Cupnoodles Museum.

458
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,563
That sounds like fun.

459
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,775
You get to make your own
cup noodles there.

460
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,154
And... you get to eat it?

461
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,698
-You can have it.
-Cool!

462
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,243
So, let's say we go to the museum.

463
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,122
We go to the Cupnoodles Museum
and that's it?

464
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,539
There's Chinatown.

465
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,170
-What do you think?
-The museum sounds fun.

466
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,881
Would you have fun though?

467
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,217
Of course I would.
Let's go there.

468
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,760
There are other things to do there.

469
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,595
-Other places to go?
-Yeah.

470
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:37,476
Let's think about all the other things
we can do in Yokohama.

471
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,560
Deal.

472
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,110
Okay? There might be some.

473
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,989
{\an8}This totally works.
Easy-peasy.

474
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,417
Yeah, it looks cleaner.

475
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,918
Totally.

476
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,632
-Let's take a break.
-Sure.

477
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,009
-Cleaning adjourned.
-Cheers.

478
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,012
It's too hot.
I'm going under the shade.

479
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,273
I'm moving out tomorrow.

480
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,483
-You're kidding!
-No way.

481
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,734
You're not serious, are you?

482
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,948
-Seriously?
-Yeah, I'm moving out tomorrow morning.

483
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,825
Why?

484
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,661
Remember the other day...

485
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,498
at my presentation?

486
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,170
It really felt like it was
the end of a chapter,

487
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,214
and that a new chapter's beginning.

488
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:54,720
So from now on,
I'm my own person.

489
00:25:54,803 --> 00:26:00,016
Both for my career and other challenges,
like studying abroad.

490
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,812
I want to thank you both for everything.

491
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:08,775
I thought about letting you know sooner...

492
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,653
but I didn't want things to be depressing.

493
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,907
I don't like this.

494
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,291
-Don't cry.
-Please don't go.

495
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,421
-I'll come visit Hawaii with Hikaru.
-You should.

496
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,257
-I will.
-Me too.

497
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,883
You should.

498
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,386
I'm sure you already know this, Arman.

499
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,805
I'm sure I don't have to say this.

500
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,851
Stay the way you are.

501
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,770
Thanks.

502
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,607
I think your true calling
isn't to become a firefighter.

503
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,778
I think it's to stay happy,
just as you are now.

504
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,113
Stay that way.

505
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,116
Live life as the happy man that you are.

506
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,118
I think that would be awesome.

507
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,371
-It's not a title you're after.
-I guess.

508
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,457
Change of plans.

509
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,504
My dream job: Happy.

510
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,215
I think that's cool. Really.

511
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,094
I've learned a lot during my time here.

512
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,223
All right then.

513
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,850
I'm gonna do it.

514
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,394
Do it.

515
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,895
Yeah, do it.

516
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,569
Why is everyone so quiet?

517
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,238
So he's leaving.

518
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,576
Give it a second.
The women are all too shocked to comment.

519
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,162
Are you okay?

520
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,918
What's the matter with everyone?
Seriously!

521
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,753
That's not good.

522
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,964
Why?

523
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,133
This isn't the first time
someone's leaving.

524
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,802
It's called Han Loss.

525
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,762
What's Han Loss?

526
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,266
Did you see Tamosan
genuinely not wanting him to go?

527
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,186
A single tear ran down her cheek
as she said "Please don't go."

528
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,522
He's a legend!

529
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,733
That was intense.

530
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,569
I've never seen anything like that
in real life.

531
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,279
Seriously!

532
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,198
I can't believe
there's actually a man like him.

533
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,494
I seriously don't want him to go.

534
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,871
Oh, right. I should just go with him.

535
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,248
Come again?

536
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,043
That was close, Tokui.

537
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,255
Yeah, she had a deranged
look on her face.

538
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:42,554
-Remember that bit about Arman's dreams?
-Yeah.

539
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,931
-I thought someone wrote a script.
-Seriously.

540
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,268
He said some really good stuff there.

541
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,103
"You're happy, not a firefighter."

542
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,231
-Yeah, but...
-I wanna say something like that.

543
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,857
What is it?

544
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,609
I'm talking here!

545
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,654
I'm sorry.

546
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,864
You're scaring me.

547
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,074
-Yu isn't usually like that.
-I know, right?

548
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,868
I've never said anything like that before.

549
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,954
-He was perfect from beginning to end.
-He was amazing.

550
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,625
-He hasn't made one mistake.
-Not one! That's perfection, right there.

551
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,337
So next up must be when he's leaving.
He's leaving!

552
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,673
Oh, no, that's right.

553
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,925
-Our last Han.
-Let's see our last Han.

554
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,428
-Wait a second.
-Let's see how he'll part from everyone.

555
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,054
Let me make one thing clear.

556
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,847
Don't talk.

557
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,688
Wow, that was cool.

558
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,023
{\an8}Before we start eating,

559
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,735
{\an8}I have an announcement to make
to you three.

560
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,071
I'm leaving <i>Terrace House</i> tomorrow.

561
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,452
Seriously? I'm still cooking.

562
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,412
I'm no longer a student.

563
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,958
I have to start working.

564
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,836
-I don't want you to.
-Sorry.

565
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,003
But...

566
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,006
It's okay. I'll leave quietly tomorrow.
Let's eat.

567
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,174
Let's eat!

568
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,884
-Let's try not to be sad and eat.
-Agreed.

569
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,346
-Thanks, guys.
-Let's just eat.

570
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,307
This feels like
a very cheerful goodbye party.

571
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,391
Right?

572
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,686
We decided to send him off happy.

573
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,565
Riko, take those dumplings.

574
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,816
Sure.

575
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,444
Thanks, guys.

576
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,072
-Those look amazing!
-Oh, yeah!

577
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,410
-Hansan balanced this group out.
-I know, right?

578
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,579
You brought this group together.

579
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,790
It's hard to not be sad.

580
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,043
This is the universe telling us
to be stronger.

581
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,297
-We've all been relying on you.
-Yeah.

582
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,091
All of us.

583
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,052
You girls are like sisters to me.

584
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,596
All of you.

585
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,599
Take care of them for me, will you?

586
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,601
Wait a minute.

587
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,561
Well, if you girls ever want to talk...

588
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,813
come to me.

589
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,360
-He's pretty...
-Unreliable?

590
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,611
No, he's pretty good.

591
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,781
Don't underestimate him.

592
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,326
Is there anything you want to do
before you leave?

593
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,870
Do I?

594
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,830
-Let's do something.
-Good idea.

595
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,585
It's so cold. For real.

596
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,130
I didn't think I was going to end up
in this pool again.

597
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,716
So thanks, I guess?

598
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,342
-Oh, yeah?
-Get in there.

599
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,188
-Is it really cold?
-Actually, it's not bad.

600
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,815
-Are you sure?
-I'm coming in!

601
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,149
Ready, set, go!

602
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,781
It's so cold.

603
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,952
-Is it really cold?
-What are you doing over there?

604
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,912
-No, please!
-Come on!

605
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,587
This is scary to watch.

606
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,799
-Goodbye party's over!
-Really?

607
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,897
-Morning.
-Hey, good morning.

608
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,398
Hansan...

609
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,612
-You're cleaning.
-Yeah.

610
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,905
You don't have to!

611
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,033
-I'm sorry we were up late last night.
-No worries at all.

612
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,286
There's a ballet competition this month.

613
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,998
I'm going to get into the top three.

614
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,960
I'll be rooting for you,
Momoka Mitsunaga, 21 years old.

615
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,840
-Okay.
-Stay happy, like Arman.

616
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:50,969
See you later.

617
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,472
-Okay, I'm gonna go now.
-Okay.

618
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,433
-Thank you.
-Thank you, too.

619
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,978
-See you.
-See you.

620
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,113
-You're gonna carry all that?
-I've accumulated a lot.

621
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,157
I remember that bag.

622
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,701
Oh, this? The grass bag?

623
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,452
It's literally a grass bag.

624
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,373
-Hansan, here.
-What?

625
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,375
We made it together.

626
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,253
When did you do that?
Really?

627
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,463
Thanks.

628
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,263
Thank you.

629
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm going to treasure this.

630
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,813
Don't make me cry, guys.

631
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,108
I have to leave now!

632
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:29,985
Sorry.

633
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,950
I promise you that...

634
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:42,706
one day you'll hear about me
as an architect somewhere.

635
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,252
Watch me.

636
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,090
-Watch me, okay?
-We will.

637
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,508
Thank you.

638
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,177
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

639
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,516
I'm leaving now.

640
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,189
-All right then!
-Thank you!

641
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,775
See you around, Hansan.

642
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,237
Okay, see you around!

643
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,906
That was so anti-climactic.

644
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,840
He's gone.

645
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,260
He really is.

646
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,055
-There's no one to lead us now.
-True.

647
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,140
Are we gonna fall apart now?

648
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,184
What?

649
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,063
-Already? Isn't it too soon?
-Seriously?

650
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,106
Wow, my heart stopped just now.

651
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,650
What is it?

652
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,779
Seriously, it's too soon!
What should I say?

653
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,030
-Arman, Arman!
-Yes?

654
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,283
<i>I'm moving in today.</i>

655
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,702
Come in.

656
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,477
-What's happening?
-Hey, there.

657
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,772
You were bawling your eyes out
when Hansan was crying.

658
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:35,443
I was like, "How much can she cry?"

659
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,492
Yu, seriously?

660
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,745
-She's bawling.
-Really?

661
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,747
She's bawling.

662
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,083
I never met the guy,
and I'm absolutely smitten by him.

663
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,252
She said it.

664
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,422
You know how alumni sometimes come back
in later episodes?

665
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,842
Like, "Let's ask Hansan
if we need his help" type of thing.

666
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,719
Like, "Ask Kojimasan."

667
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,637
That's a good idea.

668
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,265
Why do we have to console you?
