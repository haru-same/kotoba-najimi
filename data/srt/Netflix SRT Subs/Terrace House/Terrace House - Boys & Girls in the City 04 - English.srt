1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,974
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,810
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,062
{\an8}<i>living together, and we observe</i>
<i>how they interact with each other.</i>

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,440
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,150
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,234
{\an8}That's right.

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,822
So, a lot happened in the last episode.

9
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,657
-Yes, it did.
-That's right.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,870
First, Makoto and Minori
went for a night jog together.

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:37,955
{\an8}-It's totally fine.
-Sure is.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,207
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR AT MEIJI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,584
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,668
{\an8}Go running again.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,961
{\an8}-I might ask you to accompany me.
-Hmm?

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,129
{\an8}I might ask you
to come running with me again.

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,966
{\an8}<i>-There's certainly a good vibe there.</i>
<i>-Yes, there is.</i>

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,135
{\an8}And then the barista is asking
these questions with a little envy.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,638
{\an8}-The Asano vibe.
-Asano vibe.

20
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,640
{\an8}Like this.

21
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,892
{\an8}<i>You're referring to Atsuko Asano</i>
<i>from the trendy TV dramas.</i>

22
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,269
{\an8}<i>-The influence of Ms. Atsuko.</i>
<i>-Yes, that was there.</i>

23
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,437
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD, OFFICE WORKER

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,939
-And then, we cannot forget...
-Yes.

25
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,316
...the tap dancer, Yuki.

26
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,569
He made her speak out about her dream.

27
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,615
Then in return,
he told her "it's not that clear."

28
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,409
Like, I wasn't getting anything
even though you've talked a lot.

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,494
{\an8}It's confusing.

30
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,037
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD, TAP DANCER

31
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,625
{\an8}For me, I thought...

32
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,585
{\an8}I was doing things with certainty.

33
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,879
{\an8}What's wrong, Yuri?

34
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,672
{\an8}Why? Why are you crying?

35
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,423
What's wrong, Yuri?

36
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,887
Mizuki was trying so hard to talk it out.

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,764
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

38
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:37,848
And she cried.

39
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,268
Yes, then Yuriko started to sob along too,
like contagious vomiting.

40
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,897
Not vomiting.

41
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,481
And then while talking intimately,

42
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,609
the tap dancer, Adachi,
explained to Yuriko

43
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,403
that his intention was to be supportive.

44
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,907
You'd think that no one would be fooled by
such a carrot-and-stick approach--

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,366
-I like that.
-See?

46
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,243
-Whoa.
-She is so easy.

47
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,162
-She can't help it.
-I'm more concerned with Teacher Triendl.

48
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,288
Right.

49
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,749
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD, MED STUDENT,
4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

50
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,543
{\an8}I wanted to help her clarify
by sharing my vision and dream.

51
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,003
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 27 YEARS OLD, TAP DANCER

52
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,255
{\an8}Even if I talked endlessly
to someone who is not as passionate...

53
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,301
{\an8}something might resonate
within that person.

54
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:19,264
{\an8}So I wanted Mizuki to talk about it
and then support her,

55
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,390
{\an8}whatever it is.

56
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,685
{\an8}I'm glad we talked.

57
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,395
{\an8}Well, next time, let's go have a drink.

58
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,231
{\an8}Yeah, I want to talk again.
For sure.

59
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,775
{\an8}<i>Isn't it better that she thinks,</i>

60
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,654
"Who do you think you are?"
than to have no feelings at all--

61
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,988
-It's true.
-That's the thing.

62
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,365
There's a better chance
for her to take an interest in him.

63
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,201
-I see.
-It's more likely.

64
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,244
I totally don't get it.

65
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,165
I still don't believe it.

66
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,417
I definitely think
she totally hates him now.

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,252
-Hmm.
-Tap?

68
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,296
I think she'll never like him.
And that's it.

69
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,464
-Until the very end?
-Yes!

70
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,467
-Nice and loud.
-It's like, "Hey!"

71
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,553
-Like a "yes" that sounds like, "Hey!"
-Hey!

72
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,273
I haven't been home
at this time in a while.

73
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,025
That's right. You're usually out late.

74
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,237
Is this normal?

75
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,614
As usual, everyone is out late.

76
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,951
I'm bored.

77
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,995
-Yeah, I'm bored.
-Right?

78
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,831
I'm going out for a run again.

79
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,834
-Want to go out again?
-Sure.

80
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,920
When do you want to go?
Before that, what should we do for dinner?

81
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,546
Do you want to make something?

82
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,090
Sure.

83
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,968
-There's a bunch of things in the fridge.
-I'll go check it out.

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,936
-So?
-There's only salad.

85
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,688
We don't have anything.

86
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,444
-Do you want to go eat somewhere?
-Sure.

87
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,446
Where?

88
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,034
-I like grilled meat.
-Grilled meat?

89
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,202
-Can you eat that?
-Yeah.

90
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,789
Wanna go?

91
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,998
Meat!

92
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,294
{\an8}MEGURO, TOKYO

93
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,088
-It's hot
-It's not hot today.

94
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,631
No, it is.

95
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,092
-But summer will be over soon.
-The pool...

96
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,803
-Yeah.
-I wanna go in.

97
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,595
We need to clean it though.

98
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,140
{\an8}SHUEN

99
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,391
{\an8}GRILLED MEAT
SHUEN

100
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,102
{\an8}-It's our first meal out of the house.
-Yup.

101
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,478
{\an8}Surprisingly.

102
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,314
{\an8}Without everybody else.

103
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,731
{\an8}Ouch.

104
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,361
-What would you like to drink?
-Can we drink?

105
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,155
Why not?

106
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,573
-Give up on running?
-What?

107
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,450
-Give up on running?
-Yeah, forget it.

108
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,661
Got up in the afternoon and did nothing?

109
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,745
-Hey?
-Today.

110
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,206
No, I haven't done anything.

111
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,999
Neither today nor yesterday.

112
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,252
We went to bed late.

113
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,296
It was really late yesterday.

114
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,131
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

115
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,008
Yay.

116
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,681
-What was up with that?
-Well, Yuki is an adult.

117
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,226
I mean, what he said was a bit harsh.

118
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,230
I thought he didn't have to go that far.

119
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,148
Like, no one opposed him.

120
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,943
Right. It must have felt like that
on the women's side.

121
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,613
You know, Uchi and I talked
for a while last night.

122
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,531
-After I went to bed?
-Yes, that's right.

123
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,034
-What did you guys talk about?
-Right.

124
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,661
What? What?

125
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,167
-What did you talk about?
-What do you think we talked about?

126
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,422
So, who do you find is the best,
I mean, the easiest, to talk to?

127
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,008
The easiest to talk to?

128
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,718
Is it Uchi?

129
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,096
I haven't really spoken much to Uchi.

130
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,809
I mean, the only time
we talked alone was yesterday.

131
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,395
-Right.
-Yeah.

132
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,825
-When you see us women talking...
-Yup.

133
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,038
...do you wonder if we're getting along?

134
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,165
I do. I do! I really do.

135
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,541
I totally think about it.

136
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,045
I think, like,
"Those girls are holding back."

137
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,463
What should I do about that?

138
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,926
-You are holding back, right?
-Yeah, of course.

139
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,638
It's probably easier to talk to us
three guys than the two girls, right?

140
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,600
That's tough.

141
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,645
-It's not right.
-What?

142
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,855
-Not good.
-Not good.

143
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,035
-We're home.
-Welcome back.

144
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,537
-Welcome back.
-I'm full.

145
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,497
I am surprised.

146
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,875
Did you cook and eat by yourself?

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,337
-You guys went to eat grilled meat, right?
-Grilled meat.

148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,879
-I'm jealous.
-It was delicious.

149
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,548
What did you do today?

150
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,219
-I stayed at home.
-What about practice?

151
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,222
It was raining today, so no practice.

152
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,349
Right, it was raining today.

153
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,851
And you, Minori?

154
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,561
I was at a photo shoot...

155
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,730
-Oh, right.
-...and was back by around 3:00.

156
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,523
-So you were back early.
-Yes.

157
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,150
Isn't it because you're a good model?

158
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,445
-Exactly.
-Why the praise all of a sudden?

159
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,990
You're not very convincing.

160
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,116
"Exactly."

161
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,370
-You really think so?
-Yes, I do. I do think so.

162
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,746
It's scary.

163
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,208
That must've been so nice
to go out to eat.

164
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,667
We talked about a bunch of stuff.

165
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,503
Well, sure.

166
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,464
You girls have qualms

167
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,841
-and don't talk about certain things.
-Yes.

168
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,762
So we talked about
what that was all about.

169
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,555
What do you think about that, Yuri?

170
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,308
I want all three of us girls to talk.

171
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,810
I think that if all three of us talk,

172
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,313
it won't go anywhere.

173
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,982
You want the two of you to talk instead?

174
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,526
Well, it's not that I want
the two of us to talk...

175
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,194
-Well, so...
-Right, so...

176
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm kidding!

177
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,864
No, really. I'm off to shower.

178
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,243
It's like I just booted you out.

179
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,040
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

180
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,335
So with the three of us,
all we have talked about is...

181
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,879
-Yes.
-...what our types are.

182
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,173
Yes.

183
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,466
And even if we continue talking,

184
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,428
I think that we'll probably
only talk about that.

185
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,139
In reality,

186
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,225
if this was with our other friends,

187
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,894
we wouldn't be limited by time.

188
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,022
Yes.

189
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,233
So I don't think
that we would confide as easily.

190
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,195
But because we do have
a limited time to live here,

191
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,573
I think we need to ask each other things

192
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,285
during the time we have together.

193
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,703
-Yes.
-Yes.

194
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,372
-Yes. Exactly.
-Right?

195
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,227
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD,

{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD, MED STUDENT,
4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

201
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,169
{\an8}Well.

202
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,130
{\an8}Pardon me. Cheers.

203
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,632
I started drinking without you.

204
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,051
-So, do you think Makocchan...
-Yeah?

205
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,346
...is into Minori?

206
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,972
I'm not sure.

207
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,807
It seems like it.

208
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,810
-They did go out for dinner.
-Yes, they did.

209
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,979
I was wondering if it's mutual.

210
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,065
There's no guarantee it's mutual
just because they went out for dinner.

211
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,693
Of course.

212
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,196
-But it seems like it.
-Yes.

213
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,823
-Oh, welcome back.
-We're home.

214
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,825
-Welcome back.
-We're home.

215
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,202
Oh, wow.

216
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,329
-We got it.
-You got it.

217
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,956
There's so much.

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,833
-Thank you. Oh, Jenga!
-Some party goods.

219
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,127
Jenga.

220
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,753
-It's not the usual Jenga.
-I like Jenga.

221
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,880
Oh, Uno! Jenga!

222
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,006
Oops.

223
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,550
How was biking?

224
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,009
-Great.
-Great.

225
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,344
-Great.
-I wasn't asking you.

226
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,887
You always go biking.

227
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,431
-Biking is great.
-Biking is great.

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,517
You look happy.

229
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,561
-Oh, here he is.
-Hey.

230
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,398
-A nap?
-I was having a little sleep.

231
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,857
We'll play Jenga today.

232
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,693
Jenga? Really?

233
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,862
What were you up to today, Makoto?

234
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,534
I went and spoke with the coach.
It was okay.

235
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:05,081
-How did it go?
-Well, I'm not sure.

236
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,210
-What happened?
-Well, it wasn't like anything happened.

237
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,922
-You seem to be in low spirits.
-Well, no, I'm not in low spirits.

238
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,591
-Are you tired?
-Yes, I'm tired.

239
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,887
Isn't Mizuki coming home?

240
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,389
She's at work.

241
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,765
-Really?
-Overnight.

242
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,891
-Is that right?
-Yes.

243
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,184
When will she be back?

244
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,520
-She'll be back tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

245
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,565
-So, today we'll play Jenga.
-Jenga.

246
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,734
Shall we play Jenga?

247
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,042
-Makoto doesn't seem well.
-Yeah, he seems down.

248
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,171
We'll have to talk to him
to clear the air.

249
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,882
Off to Gunma for work.

250
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,884
Be back tomorrow.
Mizuki

251
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,513
-We were waiting for you, Yuki.
-Oh, really? Sorry.

252
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,180
-That's it for today.
-That's it for today.

253
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,808
Oof.

254
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:14,150
-Why are you smiling so much?
-Because you seem a little down.

255
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,402
-Me?
-Yes.

256
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,487
-Seem down.
-You gonna tell us?

257
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,156
Well, it's not that I feel down.

258
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,617
You know how...

259
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,244
-I play baseball, right?
-Yes.

260
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:32,126
And I don't know what impressions
you get from that,

261
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:37,089
but I graduated high school and played
during my first year of university.

262
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,885
In my second year,
I wasn't getting along with my teammates,

263
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,845
and I was in a phase where
I only wanted to have fun,

264
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,431
and I wasn't really committed.

265
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:50,227
So for a year or so,
I didn't go to practice.

266
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,939
So at the beginning of my third year...

267
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,902
I went and apologized to my coach
and asked to start all over again.

268
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,074
So, in my third year I went in
as an entry-level player.

269
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,327
I practiced with the younger players.

270
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,371
I wasn't participating
in the main practice, of course,

271
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,039
and did chores.

272
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,584
My third year was, like,
I was the first person to arrive

273
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,627
and the last person to leave,
kind of thing.

274
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,672
So, just before my fourth year,

275
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,716
they began to let me play.

276
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,888
Because of that gap,
I'm not in the top level of players.

277
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:31,603
So, when we were talking to Mizuki...

278
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,230
about our ambitions,

279
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,734
and about her dream being vague
and not clear enough...

280
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,488
at that time, I also felt
obligated to talk about where I was,

281
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,615
but I couldn't say anything.

282
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:50,705
I went along with you two as though I did,

283
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,707
even though I also doubt mine.

284
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,504
So I feel I need to apologize to Mizuki.

285
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,632
Also, my coach is concerned that,

286
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,384
although I'm supposed to
focus on baseball,

287
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,051
I put myself into situations like this...

288
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,431
and that it will affect my performance.

289
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,477
Of course, I want to have fun
and drink alcohol with everyone here,

290
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,312
and my lifestyle has already been
changing into that.

291
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,650
There's only two months left.

292
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,067
What are you going to do?

293
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,739
Well, I have no choice but try
and get into the top level.

294
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:31,120
We didn't talk about that, right?
Like, where you stand in your team.

295
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,873
I did want to know, though.

296
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:39,671
When I hear about how the two of you
have figured out your goals and all that,

297
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,089
you both see it clearly.

298
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,386
So I was feeling kind of guilty...

299
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,430
to be honest.

300
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,560
If he apologizes...

301
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,937
I think Mizuki's heart will skip a beat.

302
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,230
Like, if he says to her,

303
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,776
"Yeah, I'm also a little unsure of
my dream, and I wanted to be helpful."

304
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,987
And he comes and apologizes
for not speaking up.

305
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,073
Wouldn't she fall for him for that?

306
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,408
<i>I love you</i>

307
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,951
That's it!

308
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,913
Yeah, so he felt guilty.

309
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,915
-I didn't know.
-I didn't know.

310
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,251
So, being in his fourth year
but not at the top level,

311
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,588
there's definitely some conflicts there.

312
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,048
He was saying he apologized
and went back to the team.

313
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,427
-It's like that guy from <i>Slam Dunk.</i>
-Hisashi Mitsui.

314
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,971
But you know,
Hisashi Mitsui had this crazy talent.

315
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,809
Man, you don't have to be so passionate.

316
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,811
It was just a small comment.

317
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:42,442
Also, you know, it seems
as though Tap...

318
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,777
has taken on a role
as the older brother or leader.

319
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,903
-Yes.
-Yes, he has.

320
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,156
But, like, "You seem down.
We need to talk."

321
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,952
-Wouldn't you hate that?
-No, I'd want him to listen to me.

322
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,954
You are totally weird.

323
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,124
There's no way I'd want that.

324
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,543
-It's not weird.
-It's not weird.

325
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,087
But, you know

326
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,923
along with Minori, there's this issue

327
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,843
-with being open amongst the girls.
-Right.

328
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,595
This time, we see not only
the romantic relationships,

329
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,723
but also the complexity
of the human relationships.

330
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,141
Right.

331
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,644
{\an8}Well!

332
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,731
{\an8}-We haven't...
-What?

333
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,149
{\an8}We haven't seen you for a while.

334
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,192
'Cause you don't sleep up there.

335
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,278
We talk often.

336
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,905
But aren't you sleeping when I come home?

337
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,322
-Or not?
-No, no.

338
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,324
You stay downstairs for too long.

339
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,952
Hi, come in.

340
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,871
-Hey.
-Oh!

341
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,955
Hey.

342
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,249
-I've come to talk.
-About what?

343
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,918
-Come in.
-I'm surprised.

344
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,460
Pardon me.

345
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,505
-This is rather unusual. First time.
-What's up?

346
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,174
-Sit here.
-I want to sit on a chair.

347
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,341
Want this chair? Here.

348
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,885
-Aw, you know.
-What is it?

349
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,180
-What's wrong?
-Well, I'm here to apologize to Mizuki.

350
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,682
Right.

351
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,141
And...

352
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,646
it's not like there's this guilt,
but there's something I didn't say before.

353
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,607
-Yes.
-I got into university

354
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,985
and joined the baseball team.
I practiced hard my first year.

355
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,237
In my second year,

356
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,324
I hit a phase where
I wanted to have fun and all.

357
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,036
So in my third year, I realized
I needed to come to my senses.

358
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,997
So, I went to see the coach,

359
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:24,794
and I asked to be allowed to play
even if I had to start all over again.

360
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,046
So I was regarded only as
an entry-level player

361
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,133
and not really considered
as part of the team by everyone else.

362
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,511
I would be part of the team
once I continued on to my fourth year.

363
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,305
So now...

364
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,183
I'm finally part of the team.

365
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:45,189
That said, it felt like
we all kind of ganged up on you.

366
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,233
I left you all alone.

367
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,653
I should've said this
right then and there.

368
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,779
So...

369
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,615
Thank you so much
for coming here to say that.

370
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,867
-Oh, no, it's inexcusable.
-Don't worry.

371
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,702
So for the next two months...

372
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:03,415
I have to be kind of devoted to baseball
and do my best.

373
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,210
-You need to give it your all.
-Yes, I have to.

374
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,839
-Sorry to take up your time.
-Oh, no, not at all.

375
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,799
-Well, good night.
-Thank you.

376
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,509
-Good night.
-See you.

377
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,719
-Good night.
-Good night.

378
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,928
Good night.

379
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,393
-Are you relieved?
-Yes.

380
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,230
It made me kind of happy to think
that he was concerned about me.

381
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,523
It made me happy.

382
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,359
I'm glad that happened.

383
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,858
Cut it out!

384
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,659
Phew!

385
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,828
Now it's clean.

386
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,707
Pretty much.

387
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,750
You're going out
with Yuriko tonight, right?

388
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,626
We're going out to drink sake.

389
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,837
She can drink.

390
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,755
Yes, it's easier to ask out
girls who can drink.

391
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,507
She scores high.
Easy to ask.

392
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,885
So who are you closest to?

393
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,346
-Or, like, that you can...
-Yuriko probably.

394
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,014
...talk to most easily?

395
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,391
All of them aside from Mizuki...

396
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,477
for now.

397
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,020
-By the way...
-Our schedules don't match.

398
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,689
...me, too.

399
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,358
I wonder if she's going to stay
the way she is now.

400
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,401
The other girls were saying that, too.

401
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,531
{\an8}EBISU, TOKYO

402
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,759
-Hey there.
-Hey.

403
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,385
-Thanks for coming.
-How was your day?

404
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,721
-Good.
-I've never seen you wear a hat.

405
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,265
-Yes, it's cold. You need to keep covered.
-I see.

406
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,559
Um, I got you something.

407
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,814
-Hepalyse?
-Yes.

408
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,275
-Because we'll drink too much. And you?
-I got one, too.

409
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,029
I got myself the turmeric one.

410
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,321
-Did you drink it already?
-I drank it already.

411
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,949
-Then I'll drink it now. Cheers.
-Cheers.

412
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,537
-Now we can plunge into sake.
-Well, that's it.

413
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,455
Drinking Hepalyse is a smart idea, right?

414
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,957
Yes, it is.

415
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,127
They say it makes a big difference...

416
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,712
whether you drink it or not.

417
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,050
-So, with this, you'll be fine tomorrow.
-I'll be fine tomorrow.

418
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,302
Wanna go?

419
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,594
Let's go.

420
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,810
Let's have a toast.

421
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,436
Yes, let's.

422
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's drink.

423
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,231
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

424
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,073
So we're going to see you dance

425
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,241
on the fourth of September, right?

426
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,577
I've never seen
something like that before,

427
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,370
so I can't imagine what it will be like.

428
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,956
I'm guessing it's like jazz or something.

429
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,040
Yes, like jazz.

430
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,333
-Oh, is that so?
-You got it.

431
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,796
It developed alongside
the culture of jazz and swing music.

432
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,965
This week, my boss will perform

433
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,217
at the Blue Note in New York.

434
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,845
-Oh, wow. He's that accomplished?
-Yes.

435
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,180
I would like to perform at a place
like the Blue Note someday.

436
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,932
-Yes.
-Yes.

437
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,516
I hope you're looking forward
to the fourth.

438
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,602
-I am.
-I'm all right.

439
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,982
This is fun.

440
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,985
-We don't get to go out to drink much.
-True.

441
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,237
Where do you usually go out for fun?

442
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,239
-Like, the library...
-Right, right.

443
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,032
-...or an aquarium.
-Right, right.

444
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,869
Where do you like?
Where do you go?

445
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,203
It depends on the situation.

446
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,831
Like, if it's just guys, you mean?

447
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,582
I like going to the aquarium.

448
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,209
Man, my questions are just

449
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,003
blowing in the wind here.

450
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,130
My questions...

451
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,007
-You like the aquarium?
-I like the aquarium.

452
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,674
-So do you want to go to the aquarium?
-Should we?

453
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,802
Let's go then.

454
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,430

<i>Do you know</i> Terrace House?

461
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,821
Crazy reaction.

462
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,949
That was a really good reaction.

463
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,993
<i>-And you're cute, too.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>-Really?</i>
-Are you okay without makeup?

467
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,002
You are cool without makeup?

468
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,172
I'm totally fine. Totally.

00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,304

-Yup.

474
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,056
And it already has a lot of views.

475
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,682
-How many?
-40,000.

476
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,852
It's amazing. "Updates at 11:00 p.m."
It's only been 43 minutes.

477
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,980
-I don't really like it.
-How many views per second, then?

478
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,481
-That's amazing.
-That's scary.

479
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,154
How long ago was your last relationship?

480
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,199
Well, I...

481
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,329
-It's going to take a while to explain.
-That's fine.

482
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,081
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

483
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,125
We were together just until...

484
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,005
-before <i>Terrace House</i> began.
-Right.

485
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,343
He's in his first year of residency.

486
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,554
The first year of residency is...

487
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,015
the busiest period...

488
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,851
so we weren't able to see each other much.

489
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,063
As I'm also in med school,

490
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,648
I have to be understanding
of his situation.

491
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,401
I have to be understanding, however,

492
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,445
I just...

493
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,615
couldn't deal with it
in respect to how I felt.

494
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,159
-Of course you want to see each other.
-Yes.

495
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,120
I was totally upfront and told him,

496
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,164
"It's tough not seeing you,

497
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:20,501
and I also have this opportunity to grow

498
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,712
by being on <i>Terrace House."</i>

499
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,424
So with that, he said,

500
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,302
"Well I, too, am
in the most important period of my life.

501
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,722
I know you put up with a lot

502
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,017
because of my schedule,
and I'm grateful.

503
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,935
And I think the outcome will be
something you won't regret.

504
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,525
I want you to do your best."

505
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,696
It's okay.

506
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,451
We talked a whole lot when we broke up.

507
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,958
-So, that was it. How can I put it--
-I don't think you made a bad decision.

508
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,255
I think what's important is that
you made a decision about it.

509
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,548
Yes.

510
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,386
Well.

511
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,769
Sorry.

512
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,274
-I made you cry.
-Yuki, it's like...

513
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,194
I just open up so easily to you, Yuki.

514
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,113
I mean, I'm glad I talked about it.

515
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,825
-I'm really glad I talked about it.
-Is this a good day?

516
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,828
-It's a good day.
-It's a good day. Today is a good day.

517
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,331
I was really looking forward to this.

518
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,708
Me too.

519
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,335
Thank you!

520
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,129
Let's do this

521
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,672
-on a regular basis.
-Yes, let's.

522
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,053
I see.

523
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,805
We see a big development there.

524
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,975
I think we have mixed opinions about this.

525
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,060
-Right.
-If this was me,

526
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,395
and if I was in a situation where

527
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,815
I liked a person
but had to break up...

528
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,942
and then I told this to someone...

529
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,278
there's a chance that I would cry,

530
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,697
if I still liked that person.

531
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,865
I wonder what her tears meant.

532
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,993
But from the sound of it,
it was a hard breakup either way.

533
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,662
Where she wants to see him,
but he can't because he's busy.

534
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,499
She couldn't take the gap
so they broke up.

535
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,916
And her boyfriend also

536
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,086
agreed to do so.

537
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,630
You're really supportive of her.

538
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,923
Look, she brought Hepalyse
before going drinking.

539
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:38,054
Yamachan was all intense, like,
"I like her!"

540
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,181
All of a sudden.

541
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,807
Like, "I like her! She's a good person."

542
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,270
In general, any guy
will be impressed by that.

543
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,479
-Yeah, totally done in.
-Hepalyse?

544
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,897
You see, on top of that,

545
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,941
it just so happens that Yuriko

546
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,735
-is so short.
-Yes.

547
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,737
So, this gesture is like, "Here."

548
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,032
Like this, to the guy next to her,

549
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,493
-she can pause like this.
-We get it.

550
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,703
In short, we always think

551
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,539
-that short people are cheating.
-I envy them.

552
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,706
Someone looking up from below you

553
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,500
-is perceived as the cutest.
-True.

554
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,919
-I see.
-Right, so that girl is really

555
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,338
making the best use of Hepalyse.

556
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,464
Like, "Here."

557
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,758
One thing though, that last part there,

558
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,927
there's something
that makes me suspicious.

559
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,846
-I think she might be dangerous.
-Why is that?

560
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,057
She said to Yuki,
"I can talk about anything to you."

561
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,434
Yes, she did.

562
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,396
It's a little like she's putting up
her defenses or something.

563
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,940
Like, "We are not moving
towards a relationship."

564
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:35,446
As if she is indirectly maneuvering, like,
"We are in a friendship zone."

565
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,489
-Oh, so that's how you think of that.
-I see.

566
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,990
That's twisted.

567
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,116
Well, I--

568
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,077
You tend to think that way.

569
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,537
Wait a second.

570
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,414
What do you know about me?

571
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,375
-Judging me as some good-for-nothing man.
-Well, you are.

572
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:52,838
That is, you don't want to get hurt,
so that's why you think like that.

573
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,923
-What?
-It's you who is putting up your defenses.

574
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,132
Ask Ayumu there.

575
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,343
Okay, so with that--

576
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,304
"Because it's you, Ayumu,
I can talk about anything."

577
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,014
If she said that, what would you think?
It's like you just got passed over.

578
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,309
I would think that she likes me.

579
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,394
See? Normally that's how it would be seen.

580
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,895
It's that you've been through
too much crap.

581
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,231
You see everything negatively.

582
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,482
-You can't help to be like that.
-That's it.

583
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,900
I would think that person likes me.

584
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,110
-Normally, that's it.
-What?

585
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,446
-That's what it was.
-Really?

586
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,365
You don't really know, right,
trying to go along with adults?

587
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,866
Actually, that was rather obvious.

588
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,950
See?

589
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,538
It was easy to figure out.

590
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,164
Yes, this one is easy to figure out.

591
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,250
That's right.

592
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,753
From a guy's perspective,
you actually need to watch out.

593
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,838
Like, to the point where,
"Hold on! I am getting pulled in.

594
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,467
She's taking the lead,
and I need to slow down."

595
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,551
What?

596
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,011
That's what it could seem like.

597
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,306
So with what happened there,

598
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,102
where she cries a bit
and then immediately after is able to say,

599
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,187
"I can talk about anything with you."

600
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:54,733
As a woman,
I'm a little wary of how quickly

601
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,027
she recovers and does that.

602
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,031
Like, I think it's a bit too much.

603
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,198
-The alcohol?
-It's tricky.

604
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,575
It seems fishy.

605
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,202
-I think so, too.
-A little.

606
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,455
Like, the sense of heroism, a little.

607
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,708
Her eyes were getting droopy from alcohol,
and she was blinking

608
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,377
kind of like this.

609
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,504
Oh, like she's drunk.

610
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,465
You can attract most guys

611
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,551
with that sort of action.

612
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,471
Well, from her white, lacey,
puff-sleeved shirt

613
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:28,058
to Hepalyse and her crying.

614
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,851
-And then she confides her interest.
-Right.

615
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,020
Those are multi-combo moves.

616
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,023
There's a jab, then a straight.
Then in with the knee.

617
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,942
Then a high kick,
and the guy is down cold.

618
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,111
-He's got birds singing by his head.
-Birds singing.

619
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,951
-And then, "It was so nice to go out."
-Yeah.

620
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,828
Like, "Today was a good day."

621
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,621
He said,
"Let's do this on a regular basis."

622
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:53,334
-But yes, it was sweet. Really. Wasn't it?
-Yes.

623
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,504
-Is there still something unsettled there?
-Well, it's just

624
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,798
there's no straight answer yet,

625
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,508
but I feel like

626
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,594
I will continue to fight with this.

627
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,347
-I am not sure yet.
-Yes.

628
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,438
So, you're off for a whole week?

629
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,482
Yeah, I'm off for a week,

630
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,984
about seven days out of eight days.

631
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,278
I'll plan with whoever's around
and have some fun.

632
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,823
That's nice.

633
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,742
-Hey.
-I'm home.

634
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,952
You're up. Hey.

635
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,912
Welcome home.

636
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,956
-You were awake?
-I was.

637
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,541
What are you back from?

638
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,126
I went out for dinner with Yuriko.

639
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,544
Oh, that's right.

640
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,839
-How was it?
-You are smiling.

641
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,843
We just both got drunk...

642
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,302
-And that's all?
-Yeah.

643
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,265
But we did have some good conversations.

644
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,017
Like what?

645
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,103
-So you ask.
-Well, I have to ask.

646
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,315
We are getting to know each other.
Like, even if I went out with you, Uchi,

647
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,735
we would talk about deep, personal things.

648
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,861
-Yeah.
-So it was like that.

649
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,531
Right, you just got closer.

650
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,616
We didn't kiss.

651
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,075
Oh, really?

652
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,578
Wait, you think I did?

653
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,039
Yeah, just with how you came in
all drunk and happy.

654
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,332
Actually, I made her cry.

655
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,169
-Again?
-Man, you make them cry right away.

656
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,213
Were you trying to move things forward?

657
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,966
We're in the process of moving forward.

658
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,760
In the process of moving forward?

659
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,344
It's like we're slowly passing the point

660
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,766
where you no longer indicate
what your intentions are.

661
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,934
Right.

662
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,603
-What do you mean, "intentions"?
-Though I'm pretty clear with what I want.

663
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:37,979
It's not easy.

664
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,566
Yeah, it's difficult.

665
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,319
Like, after cleaning the pool
and then going out to eat,

666
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,697
I thought it was discourteous.

667
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,491
What was?
What was discourteous?

668
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,077
With Uchi's feelings.

669
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,912
Well, seriously,

670
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,623
I don't need stuff like that.

671
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,042
Like, you don't need to be conscientious

672
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,045
just because I expressed
some interest in Yuriko.

673
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,840
-Like, really...
-Well not so much conscientious--

674
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,967
No, really, I don't care
if it's discourteous.

675
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,802
I want you to go for it.

676
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,513
-So do that.
-Of course, I'll do my best.

677
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,931
Of course, for sure.
