1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,850
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:17,935
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,478
{\an8}<i>living together, and we observe</i>
<i>how they interact with each other.</i>

5
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,982
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,653
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,154
{\an8}Well, let's see.

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:34,326
{\an8}Last week, we saw the end
to Makoto and Minori's relationship.

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,621
{\an8}But the next time we decide to hang out...

10
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,665
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:45,671
{\an8}...it's not intended to mean
I'm responding to your feelings toward me.

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,050
{\an8}Minori clearly told him
she wasn't interested.

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,886
-She was very clear.
-As to why?

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,432
Minori and Tatsuya's relationship
is making steady progress.

15
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:01,186
And they made plans to see each other
at their favorite places.

16
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,815
-That's right, and we'll get to see that.
-We will.

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,191
At Girls Award.

18
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:11,154
And the memorable scene
when Tatsuya gave Minori a head massage.

19
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,073
The head massage is like
foreplay in India.

20
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,283
Powerful words.

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,619
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

22
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,663
{\an8}<i>-It was a sexy scene.</i>
<i>-It made for a good picture.</i>

23
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,626
{\an8}<i>-That was really nice.</i>
<i>-And she made pasta to thank him.</i>

24
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,170
{\an8}-The two of them are set already.
-They sure are.

25
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:32,342
{\an8}Yuriko said she can't forget her ex.

26
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,887
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD
TADAMICHI KAWANO, 25 YEARS OLD

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,555
{\an8}Before exams, we always tried
to focus on our own studies.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,392
{\an8}At least while we were together.

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,312
{\an8}I know you're looking for an answer,

30
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,692
{\an8}but I'd rather you concentrate
on your studies as a med student now.

31
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:53,030
{\an8}After I get through exams...

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,531
{\an8}will I be able to get an answer?

33
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,992
{\an8}I think I'd like to
give you an answer then.

34
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,786
{\an8}I understand.

35
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,122
What an amazing guy.
Just like these gentlemen.

36
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,751
-Oh, guys who wear sweaters like this?
-A very serious sweater.

37
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,545
Yamasato and I were inspired by the ex.

38
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,880
-Really?
-Yeah.

39
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,091
We wanted to at least give
the impression of a good guy.

40
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,719
-It's nice.
-But your mouth...

41
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,889
Yes, a little too spicy perhaps.
Thought I'd add some sweetness.

42
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,433
-It's very sweet.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,686
-And...
-What?

44
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,648
-Makoto...
-Makoto will be leaving.

45
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,149
Yes, so he said
at the end of last episode.

46
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,610
The league matches end on October 18th.

47
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,947
I told you before, right?

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,824
And when it's over...

49
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,704
-I'm thinking of moving out.
-For real?

50
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,206
Well, maybe now...

51
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,668
What was that?

52
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,005
Is the sweater restraining you?

53
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,382
This sweater keeps my mouth shut.

54
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,810
{\an8}Hi, I'm looking forward to
working with you.

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,479
Come this way please.

56
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,523
-Watch your step.
-This way.

57
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,693
MS. SEINA SHIMABUKURO

58
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,487
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,906
{\an8}Hello. I'm ready.

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,449
{\an8}SEINA SHIMABUKURO,
28 YEARS OLD, MODEL

61
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
Oh, are you the one from <i>Terrace House?</i>

62
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,707
I'm Uchihara.
It's nice to meet you.

63
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,044
Is it all right to ask
how things are going?

64
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,630
It's fine.
I made my feelings clear to her.

65
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,884
-Really?
-I'm waiting for her response.

66
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,803
-Oh, you're already at that point.
-Yes, at that point.

67
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,222
-Waiting for her answer.
-I see.

68
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,100
-I am going to take her to dinner.
-Good morning.

69
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,435
-Morning.
-Good morning.

70
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,937
It's nice to meet you.

71
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,982
-I'm Seina Shimabukuro.
-I'm Minori Takada.

72
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,609
I watch <i>Terrace House.</i>

73
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,031
-Sit here, Minori.
-Over here?

74
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,992
Is it fun at <i>Terrace House?</i>

75
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,452
It... is.

76
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,705
Are you in love?

77
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,334
Maybe I am?

78
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,256
-He confessed his feelings to you, right?
-I think so.

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,843
-He kind of told me.
-"Kind of"?

80
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,054
-It wasn't a complete confession.
-Not completely?

81
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,389
-He said it was.
-What?

82
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,768
He's right there,
so this is a little embarrassing.

83
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,854
-It wasn't totally clear at all.
-Are you serious?

84
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,358
I don't think you guys
are quite on the same page.

85
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,237
-Yeah, maybe not.
-But you're living together, so...

86
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,364
maybe you need to discuss it.

87
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,034
But we're planning to go
for dinner after all this.

88
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,578
So we'll probably talk about it then.

89
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,208
-You're not turning him down, right?
-No.

90
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,419
Yay!

91
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,422
Tatsuya's going to be so happy.

92
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,843
-I'm so embarrassed.
-I see.

93
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,723
I'm going to spray your hair.

94
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,482
Hey.

95
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,151
So I heard from Minori.

96
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,863
What is it?
Are you about to drop a bomb?

97
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:25,951
No, no, Minori was saying
she wasn't sure about your feelings.

98
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,244
-Really?
-Yeah.

99
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,536
For real?

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,330
You asked her right?

101
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,166
I told her she didn't have to
give me an answer at that moment.

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,501
Oh, so not at that moment.

103
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,462
I told her she didn't need
to answer right then.

104
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,756
I'll tell her more clearly next time.

105
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,508
-Yeah.
-I didn't try hard enough.

106
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,343
Yeah, you need to push harder.

107
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,428
You need to be confident.

108
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,639
-Thanks for the advice.
-Oh, of course.

109
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,391
I'll be clearer next time.

110
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,727
Yeah, but when I asked
if she'd turn you down, she said no.

111
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,813
-Great!
-Good luck.

112
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,216

118
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,242
{\an8}Looks good.

119
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,329
Beautiful.

120
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,706
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,888
{\an8}I'm exhausted.

122
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,475
{\an8}-Good work today.
-Thank you.

123
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,935
-It was good.
-Too stiff?

124
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,355
You were, but it was good.
You were cute.

125
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,439
Thank you.

126
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,774
-The smile at the end...
-What?

127
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
Your smile at the end was beautiful.

128
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,818
-Was it on?
-Yes.

129
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,572
-But you seem exhausted now.
-I am.

130
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,992
You can relax when you get home.
You can eat, right?

131
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,743
I want tasty food.

132
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,204
Let's go eat soon.

133
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,914
-Yes, please.
-Dinner?

134
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,416
Dinner.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,334
I'm glad, though.

136
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,004
You might get more jobs after this.

137
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:28,591
I really hope so.
My other job is about to end.

138
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,344
-Let's do our best.
-I will.

139
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,972
"Thank You Everyone" PARTY

140
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,683
Everyone sitting?

141
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,727
{\an8}-Good work!
-Good work!

142
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,398
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

143
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,777
The best part was
when Minori smiled at the end.

144
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,986
-Yeah, it was cute.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,447
-It was super cute.
-Thank you.

146
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,824
-Did you see, Uchi?
-Yeah, from the back.

147
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,493
So things have settled down for everyone
except for Yuriko?

148
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,954
When do exams start?

149
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,957
-Day after tomorrow.
-Wow, that's soon.

150
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,625
What kind of test is it?

151
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,253
If I pass, I get to move on.
If I fail, I have to repeat the year.

152
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,673
-Are you ready?
-I think so.

153
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,801
Did I tell everyone
that baseball ended yesterday?

154
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,097
-Yesterday?
-Yesterday.

155
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,599
-Way to go.
-The end of college baseball for me.

156
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,726
-Good work.
-So you're retired.

157
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,731
So I'm leaving <i>Terrace House</i> tomorrow.

158
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,191
-What?
-What?

159
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,443
I'm leaving.

160
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,820
He told us this already.

161
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,531
-Tomorrow morning.
-Tomorrow morning?

162
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,534
He wanted to time it
with the end of the baseball season.

163
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,787
That's why you said
we should all have dinner together today!

164
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,955
That's right.

165
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,166
You could have told us sooner.

166
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,043
It's so sudden!

167
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,713
-I'm leaving.
-For real?

168
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,674
Why'd you whisper that?

169
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,551
-What?
-It's so sad!

170
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,972
I know it's hard to digest,
but it's something Makoto decided.

171
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,225
Right.

172
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,979
Don't get all sad.

173
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,190
Let's keep this fun.

174
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,485
-Let's make it fun!
-Shall we drink?

175
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,196
-To Makocchan's new start.
-Yeah.

176
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,448
Thank you, guys.

177
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,784
Thank you!

178
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,539
Good luck, Makocchan.

179
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,306
I don't know how to send him off.

180
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,852
-Hey, guys.
-Good morning.

181
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,524
-Wow, a lot of stuff.
-Yeah, it's crazy.

182
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,696
Were you able to sleep?

183
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,406
Yeah.

184
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,206
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

185
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,875
Thank you.

186
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,337
I'll miss you guys.

187
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,924
We'll miss you, too.

188
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,259
I've got...

189
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,636
We don't need anything.

190
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,013
-For real?
-What is it?

191
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,099
I wrote each of you a letter.

192
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,726
For Yuriko.

193
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,143
Thank you!

194
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:30,523
-For Minori and Mizuki.
-Thank you.

195
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,652
-For Yuki Adachi.
-It's so formal of you.

196
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,112
Read it after I leave.

197
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,531
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

198
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,157
I think I'll go.

199
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,078
-Get going.
-Okay, let's go.

200
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,415
-To the door?
-Yes, and say goodbye.

201
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,669
-See you later!
-Later!

202
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,590
-Thanks, Makocchan!
-Thanks, Makocchan!

203
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,697
-Wait, wait.
-What?

204
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,782
This is a surprise!

205
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,785
For real? From Hawaii?

206
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,912
They've got a wide audition range.

207
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,998
-For real?
-Wow!

208
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,208
Oh, because it's Netflix!

209
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,170
-They service the entire world.
-That's right.

210
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,172
It is a foreign company, after all.

211
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,718
We're country bumpkins in comparison.

212
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,430
Oh, wow, my heart's starting to pound!

213
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,765
Wait a second!

214
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,808
We're so quick to forget
the person who left.

215
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,521
The impact was so huge.

216
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,606
All our attention was pulled that way.

217
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,402
-We should just thank Makoto.
-Thank you.

218
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,945
Well, a lot happened, but he got through.

219
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,698
He was honest and good toward the end.

220
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,242
Well, not quite an honest person.

221
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,078
Oh, his sweater must be on the thin side.

222
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,706
It's actually really uncomfortable.
Can I take it off?

223
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:39,796
Well, let's hope
he learned something from this.

224
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,964
-He experienced love as well.
-Yes.

225
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:47,094
But wasn't it a little much,
all those tattoos on his arm?

226
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,347
-I can't wait to see his face!
-Yes, I can't wait.

227
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,142
What'll we do if his face is like Tyson's?

228
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,815
If it's all tattooed up here, too.
How scary would that be?

229
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,733
What does he do?

230
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,485
He's aspiring to be a firefighter.

231
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,613
-So he's a student still?
-Maybe.

232
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,949
He's gonna show up.
We're still in the first half of the show.

233
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,951
I wanna see!

234
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,579
{\an8}How long are you gonna do that?

235
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,248
{\an8}This? Until I'm done.

236
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,543
-When will you finish?
-I don't know.

237
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,922
-I have another exam in a month.
-For real?

238
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,761
The doorbell?

239
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,680
Ow!

240
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,390
Wow, that was explosive.

241
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:37,394
-You're not coming?
-That's fine. You can go.

242
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,355
Let's go.

243
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,273
Yes?

244
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,737
Yes?

245
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,866
<i>I'm Arman, the new roommate.</i>

246
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,618
-What?
-A new...

247
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,785
Come in.

248
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,331
Here he comes!

249
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,375
-I'm nervous.
-Yeah, me too!

250
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,796
Evening.

251
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,215
-Good evening.
-It's nice to meet you.

252
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,300
Come in, come in.

253
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,011
Can I come in?

254
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,098
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

255
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,225
I'm Arman, the new roommate.

256
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,520
Arman, I'm Uchihara.
Nice to meet you.

257
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,690
I'm Minori.

258
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,527
I'm Yuriko.
It's nice to meet you.

259
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,991
-Oh, shoes.
-Oh, yeah!

260
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,039
I'm sorry.
I'm from America.

261
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,666
Oh, I see.

262
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,959
What do you do, Arman?

263
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,797
Me? I work part-time
at a sunglass shop in Hawaii and--

264
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,590
-What kind of shop?
-A sunglass shop.

265
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,716
A sunglass shop?

266
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,593
-What? You're from Hawaii?
-Yes, Hawaii.

267
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,969
-Oh, you're so lucky!
-I came yesterday.

268
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,180
-What?
-Yesterday?

269
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,433
Yes, Hawaii.
I was originally born in Japan.

270
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,894
Wait, you're not half?
You're from--

271
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,646
-I'm half.
-Half Japanese and...

272
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,230
Japanese and Iranian.

273
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,108
-How old are you?
-I'm 24.

274
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,402
You don't look it! 24?

275
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,821
Arman?

276
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,363
It's Arman Bitaraf.

277
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,074
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD,
ASPIRING FIREFIGHTER

278
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,409
{\an8}Most people just pronounce it Aman,
since it's easier.

279
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,493
{\an8}Aman.

280
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,830
{\an8}-Is it okay if we say "Aman"?
-Yes, that's fine.

281
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,082
Are you going to stay in Japan?

282
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,628
-That's my plan, to stay as long as I can.
-Oh, I see.

283
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,421
What are you going to do in Japan?

284
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:33,385
I hope to teach English
while I'm in Japan.

285
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,097
-I'd like to learn English.
-Sure, of course.

286
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,225
-Let's do lessons here.
-Oh, yay!

287
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,020
We can't speak English at all.

288
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,772
I can teach you.

289
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:48,025
Your Japanese is so good.
Have you lived in Japan before?

290
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:53,030
I lived here until I was ten,
and then I lived in Hawaii for 15 years,

291
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,741
and then I came back yesterday.

292
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,451
So you can speak three languages?
Japanese--

293
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,580
-I can only speak a little Farsi.
-Oh, it's Farsi.

294
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,749
-So Farsi is spoken in Iran?
-Yes.

295
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,001
Why did you want to come to <i>Terrace House?</i>

296
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,045
-No reason really...
-Nothing specific?

297
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,048
I just wanted to live in Japan.

298
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:15,344
-You've come to an amazing place.
-Yes, I know.

299
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,554
-There's a pool!
-Really?

300
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,224
You can't go in, though.
It's too cold.

301
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,727
What are your interests?

302
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,936
Interests?

303
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,898
-What are yours?
-My interests?

304
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,567
Surfing, boogie-boarding.
I also kickbox.

305
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,738
-You seem strong.
-Yes, you seem strong.

306
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,698
Can I ask?

307
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,491
-Sure.
-Do you have a girlfriend?

308
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,619
-No, I don't.
-That was quick!

309
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,373
How long have you been single?

310
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,253
-For about six months.
-Six months?

311
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,215
-What's your type?
-Well, cute...

312
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,718
and someone who's kind to everyone.

313
00:18:56,427 --> 00:19:01,390
And someone who enjoys
outdoor activities and sports.

314
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,895
For example,
I like hiking really tough trails.

315
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,273
-That's Mizuki!
-I totally thought that!

316
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,945
That's perfect.
The other girl, she's rather active.

317
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,490
And the other guy, if he drinks,
he'll talk passionately about his dreams.

318
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,117
Really? Every time?

319
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,661
-Every time.
-That could be a little tiring.

320
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,664
A little.
He already knows.

321
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,168
It's not what I thought.

322
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,088
This'll be your bed.

323
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,424
Sorry, the room's messy.

324
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,511
This is the bed.

325
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,430
Feel free.

326
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,645
It's nice.

327
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,815
-You have a lot of luggage.
-Yeah.

328
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,610
-And it's messy.
-It totally is!

329
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,529
-I'm too lazy to unpack right now.
-You can do it later.

330
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,281
Hey.

331
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,534
-Welcome back. Our new member.
-New member?

332
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,662
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Arman.

333
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,832
Arman? I'm Yuki.

334
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,960
-Nice to meet you.
-He arrived yesterday from Hawaii.

335
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,129
Wow. Your Japanese is so good.

336
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,091
I'm Japanese. Well, half.

337
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,012
I didn't expect someone with tattoos.

338
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,265
Yeah, it's intense. It's cool.

339
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,267
-Yeah, it goes pretty deep.
-Does it?

340
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,521
He can speak English,
so he's planning on teaching here.

341
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,900
-Part-time maybe.
-And he's super athletic.

342
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,694
Kickboxing, surfing, boogie-boarding.

343
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,242
-Totally athletic.
-Yeah, totally.

344
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,037
-Any aspirations for the future?
-The future?

345
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,330
-A firefighter.
-Oh, a firefighter?

346
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,332
-In Hawaii.
-A firefighter in Hawaii?

347
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:56,005
Yeah, up until I came here,
I was studying to be a firefighter.

348
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,382
He's single.

349
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,219
-Are you both single?
-We're single.

350
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,055
-I'm looking.
-He's looking.

351
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,139
Right now...

352
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,268
I'm pursuing.

353
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,437
-One of the members?
-Yeah.

354
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,606
-Which one?
-The one sitting by me, the model.

355
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,902
I'm in pursuit.

356
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,780
Well, you're free to as well.

357
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,740
-Do your best.
-I will.

358
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,828
Yeah, that would be fine with me.

359
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,205
I think I'll wait for the other girl.

360
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,749
Yeah, I'm sure you want to meet everyone.

361
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,462
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

362
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,133
Did you meet him?

363
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,677
He's here?

364
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,429
-He's here.
-I haven't met him!

365
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,515
-What's he like?
-What do you think?

366
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,934
You're smiling.

367
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,228
What kind of guy do you think he is?

368
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,939
I have no idea.

369
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,067
-What's he like?
-He's from Hawaii.

370
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,318
What?

371
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,196
He's half-Iranian and half-Japanese.

372
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,240
-Can he speak Japanese?
-He can.

373
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,117
-Wow.
-Right?

374
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,952
Is he cute?

375
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,495
He's very manly.

376
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,248
-He's got a nice body.
-Yeah, a good body.

377
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,792
Nice! That's nice.

378
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,380
-Dark eyes, tall nose.
-Yeah, tall nose.

379
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,967
-What's with the happy face?
-I like people with tall noses.

380
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,927
That's true.

381
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,513
Strong features.

382
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,414
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

383
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,666
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

384
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,709
-I'm Arman.
-Arman?

385
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,961
I arrived yesterday.

386
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,923
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Mizuki.

387
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,382
Good morning.

388
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,638
-Your T-shirt is cute.
-It's from my friend's store.

389
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,351
-I see.
-That's a cute turtleneck.

390
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,063
This? Thank you.

391
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,480
Are you a model?

392
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,899
I work at an office.

393
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,528
-You seem the most like a model.
-Really?

394
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,989
Really? Wow.

395
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,662
So, you're from Hawaii?
That's so nice.

396
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,498
-Do you surf?
-I do.

397
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,125
Nice.

398
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,376
It's so cold.

399
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,462
It is, and I actually don't have
winter clothes.

400
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,755
-I have to go buy some.
-Oh, you have to buy some.

401
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,466
Where will you go?

402
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,136
I'm not sure.
Well, I only know of Uniqlo.

403
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,305
-I'm going to go look.
-Like the Gap?

404
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,016
-Oh, is there a Gap?
-There is.

405
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,520
-What are you going to do today?
-Go on an adventure.

406
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,939
-I still haven't--
-Adventure?

407
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,943
-I'm going to look for a part-time job.
-An exploration?

408
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,072
Do the roommates have parties here?

409
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,700
Yeah, let's have one tonight.
A welcome party.

410
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,578
Oh, a welcome party?
That'll be nice.

411
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,707
I made some rice for breakfast,
but I don't have time to eat,

412
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,710
-so please have some.
-I can have it?

413
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,837
-There's natto. Can you eat natto?
-For real?

414
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,633
-I can have it?
-Yes, the top shelf on the right is mine.

415
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,136
There's some marinated fish as well.

416
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,722
-Got it. I'll have some. Thanks.
-Please do.

417
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,103
-Okay, I'm off.
-Have fun.

418
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,439
-Later.
-See you later.

419
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,323
What a surprise. Arman.
Seems nice.

420
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,160
-You're a big fan already, right, Tri?
-Yes.

421
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,619
-You like him?
-Yes.

422
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,621
He was hitting it off with Mizuki.

423
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,166
He made a good impression
on everyone so far.

424
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,460
Mizuki hasn't had
a chance at love recently.

425
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:07,089
-They make such a good match.
-They do.

426
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,133
They both acted like they were interested.

427
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,802
It feels like they're each other's types.

428
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,639
And western guys are so good
at giving compliments.

429
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,767
He told her he would've guessed
she was the model.

430
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,686
Or maybe the mistake was on purpose.

431
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,356
He doesn't seem like that kind of person.

432
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,982
It's not a strategy?

433
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,902
I think that walking in with the shoes
and saying he's from America

434
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,279
was totally on purpose.

435
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,783
-It was a nice morning.
-It really was a nice morning!

436
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,287
She complimented him on his shirt,
so he complimented her turtleneck.

437
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,959
If she left, she completely miscalculated
how long it takes to cook rice.

438
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,002
Leave it alone!

439
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:49,005
-She just meant for anyone to have it.
-That's right.

440
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,801
What's Adachi going to do?
He's all alone.

441
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,512
There are no potential girlfriends
for him.

442
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,431
We don't know what'll happen with Yuriko.

443
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,640
There's no way!

444
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,685
She's already intending
to get back together with her ex.

445
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,770
Well, we don't know that for sure.

446
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,231
They will for sure!

447
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,941
You don't know that for sure.

448
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,612
I think it'll depend on the ex.

449
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,949
He just said he couldn't be back with her
before the exams.

450
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:20,496
He told her he'd go out with her
after the exams.

451
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,458
That ex may already be going out
with the hospital president's daughter.

452
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,668
-That's right.
-There it is, the drama.

453
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,755
It's possible he's already engaged.

454
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,924
I think we talked about this before.

455
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,843
-That's the drama we want.
-That's right.

456
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,470
{\an8}10TH WEEK UNAIRED SCENE

457
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:43,185
{\an8}So, Yuriko studies hard
to get back with her ex.

458
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:49,400
{\an8}But then she spots him
with another woman on the street.

459
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,611
{\an8}And that woman turns out to be

460
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,656
{\an8}the daughter of the president
of the hospital where he works.

461
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,285
{\an8}Oh, no!

462
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,329
{\an8}He really wants to get back with Yuriko,

463
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:07,376
{\an8}but his boss is pressuring him

464
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,711
{\an8}into marrying his daughter.

465
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,383
{\an8}"You're not going to make
the wrong choice, are you?"

466
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,093
{\an8}That's what the boss would say.

467
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,680
{\an8}Oh, no, what should we do?

468
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,849
{\an8}Those people don't exist!

469
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,688
He might not be into
getting back together with her.

470
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,147
The ex, that is.

471
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,775
You're saying that if he really liked her,

472
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,902
he should've said he'd be happy
to get together right then.

473
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,321
But he said maybe.

474
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,990
So you feel the presence
of the boss's daughter.

475
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,910
When you put it that way, I can't deny it.

476
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:48,292
Outside of Yuriko's school,

477
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,963
a red sports car will be parked.

478
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,757
And when Yuriko comes out,
the window will come down,

479
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,801
and she'll say, "Are you Yuriko?"

480
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,512
-The boss's daughter?
-That's right.

481
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,098
Like a young Yuki Amami.

482
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,184
People will suspect there's a script
if that ever happened.

483
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,187
{\an8}Welcome Arman!

484
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,856
{\an8}-Should we start?
-Yeah, let's start.

485
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,360
{\an8}Welcome, Arman.

486
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,737
Cheers!

487
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,783
-It tastes a little off.
-It's a little warm.

488
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,078
Let's drink today.

489
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,038
Thanks, everyone.

490
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,251
-Have you met everyone now?
-I met everyone. This morning.

491
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,294
Mizuki? What did you think?

492
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,423
Mature and cute.

493
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,758
Kind of elegant.

494
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,885
Yeah, she's elegant.

495
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,888
And she likes sports,
so I think we'll get along.

496
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,890
You think your interests match?

497
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,683
I think so.

498
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,059
Oh, she's back.

499
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,021
-Sorry I'm late. I'm back.
-Welcome back.

500
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,357
Wow, pizza.

501
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,236
-How was your quiz?
-I'm done with my quiz.

502
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,406
-You passed?
-I don't know yet.

503
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,618
-How do you feel about it?
-I think I did all right.

504
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,204
-Sorry I'm late! I'm back.
-Welcome back.

505
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,458
-I'm late.
-We should've waited.

506
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,421
Wow, it's like a party.

507
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,049
I brought cookies, so please have some.

508
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,635
-Oh, I love those!
-Thank you.

509
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,762
-Are they that famous?
-I don't know them.

510
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:28,684
-What did you do today, Arman?
-I went on a little adventure today.

511
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,645
-I walked around.
-That's an adventure?

512
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,772
I walked around Shibuya.

513
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,900
-What about tomorrow?
-I'm going to look for a gym.

514
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,111
-For kickboxing?
-For kickboxing, too.

515
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,948
I heard there were
some good ones in Japan.

516
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,493
I finished exams today.

517
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:51,873
So I feel like it's a good time
to tell you all...

518
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,588
My ex, his name is Tadamichi,

519
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:03,009
I met with him and told him
how I felt about him.

520
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,805
-I see.
-What's wrong?

521
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,725
Well, I hadn't heard
what had been happening.

522
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,647
-You guys can figure that out later.
-She said she could tell me anything.

523
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,942
-I'll be quiet now.
-Please let her talk for now.

524
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,237
-Should I be quiet now, Uchi?
-It'd be better if you were.

525
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,492
I hadn't told Yuki this yet,

526
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,661
but I haven't been able
to forget Tadamichi,

527
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,246
and wanted to get back together with him.

528
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,083
But I thought
that staying in <i>Terrace House...</i>

529
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,294
is selfish of me.

530
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:44,676
So I'm going to tell Tadamichi
how I feel about him again,

531
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,556
and after I tell everyone how it goes...

532
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,017
I'm thinking of leaving.
