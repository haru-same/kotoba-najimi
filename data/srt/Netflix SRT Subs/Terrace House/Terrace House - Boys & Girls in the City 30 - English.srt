1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,222
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,850
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,476
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,271
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,982
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,152
There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,905
-Last week...
-Oh, yes. Last week...

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,490
I know we're dying to know what happened,

9
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,410
but, before that,
let's talk about the new member.

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,579
-Rikopin.
-Rikopin.

11
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,288
-Yes, Riko Nagai.
-She's adorable.

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,415
She was chosen as the cutest
high school girl in Japan.

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,586
Out of 640,000 girls.

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,047
-Are you in your first year of college?
-I'm in my third year of high school.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,466
-You're a high school student?
-Yes.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,677
Have you graduated already?

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,763
It's an online school,
so I have another year.

18
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,724
<i>She's so pure.</i>

19
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,767
Still inexperienced and untainted.

20
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:03,480
But she can be surprisingly
calm and mature.

21
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,941
Tamosan went to her for some advice,

22
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,152
though this ended up leading
to some problems.

23
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,405
She put on sexy loungewear,
did the shoulder move

24
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,199
and tried to attract Hikaru's attention.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,494
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

26
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,623
No, something's up.
You're usually dressed pretty lamely.

27
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:28,463
Why are you acting sexy?
It's not even sexy.

28
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,550
You're so mean!

29
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,385
But why? What's going on?

30
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,722
Hikaru was like,
"What is this girl doing?"

31
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,224
And Tamosan picked up on that.

32
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,102
-And under those circumstances...
-Under those circumstances.

33
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,981
...they had the welcome party for Rikopin
with the cherry blossoms.

34
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,441
And that's when it happens.

35
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:52,154
-That was crazy.
-Yeah, it was crazy.

36
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,448
What do men find attractive in women?

37
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,909
What about loungewear?

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,160
Loungewear?

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,621
You can't do it intentionally.

40
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,415
-You had to have always done it.
-Yeah.

41
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,543
It's better if it's natural.

42
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,253
Nacchan can be a little mean sometimes.

43
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,964
I don't understand.
I'm scared.

44
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,216
-What do you mean?
-Don't worry about it.

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,594
That's gonna fester later.

46
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,263
You didn't have to bring up loungewear.

47
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,810
I wasn't talking about you.
I just wanted to hear about Hikaru.

48
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:31,109
Their expressions were right out
of a daytime soap opera.

49
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,654
A suspicious wife who opens the door

50
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,407
on an unsuspecting husband working away
from home, and...

51
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,832
It's ironic though that the expression
was from the perpetrator this time.

52
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,333
-That's true.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,669
-Isn't that scary?
-Yes.

54
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,715
"That's gonna fester later."

55
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,092
That's right.
She said it would create conflict.

56
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,427
But she's always creating conflict.

57
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,140
She probably doesn't realize

58
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:06,895
that her comments can be the trigger.

59
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,732
She's thinking she's doing it for her,

60
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,569
so for her to come back and say that,
she must be crazy.

61
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,613
It's like, "What's she thinking?"
Right?

62
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,657
So basically,
she thinks she's being helpful,

63
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:22,035
and when her actions are denied,
she snaps.

64
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,455
Let's see what happens.

65
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,459
-No, I'm scared. But I wanna see it.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,963
The two of them will be found bloodied
under the cherry blossoms.

67
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,339
Nice.

68
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,350
Good morning.

69
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,186
-You went for a run?
-Yes.

70
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,607
You're up early.
What's going on?

71
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,192
-Sorry about yesterday.
-It's okay.

72
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:56,529
I'm fine.

73
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,947
-Really?
-Yeah. But...

74
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,451
about the loungewear...

75
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:06,079
I was wondering why you brought it up?

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,000
I thought it'd be helpful information...

77
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,962
if we could find out what Hikaru likes.

78
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,923
Because Misaki would never ask.

79
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,382
I guess.

80
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,594
Because I was with her
when she bought it

81
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,514
and when she showed him,

82
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,183
to ask that in front of her...

83
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,728
I didn't think it was right.

84
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,773
I know how hard she was trying.

85
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,448
I know Misaki was put off by it.

86
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,202
It kind of put me off, too...

87
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,453
at the time.

88
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,874
I didn't like what happened.

89
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,711
I noticed her change in expression.

90
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,796
I...

91
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:02,177
I do wish that you had noticed,
but you didn't mean to hurt her, right?

92
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,431
You said it thinking it would help, right?

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,895
I think Misaki will understand
if you explain that to her.

94
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,774
Otherwise, Misaki might feel unsettled.

95
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,068
That's true.

96
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,905
If my words were taken that way
then I should explain it to her.

97
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,408
But...

98
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:31,707
I'm glad to hear
that you had good intentions.

99
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,751
-So you're okay with me?
-Yes.

100
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,088
I'm hoping Misaki will understand too.

101
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,764
I see.

102
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,033
What are you doing?

103
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,577
Well... So...

104
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,665
I said I was going
on a date with Hikaru, right?

105
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,457
So I was going to...

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,919
go ask him now.

107
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,548
Well, to give him a day.

108
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,174
I'm going to ask him out.

109
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,467
Oh, so that's why
you're fixing your makeup?

110
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,553
That's right.

111
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,847
-Nice.
-Wish me luck.

112
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,641
You're very feminine right now.

113
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,850
I'm trying.

114
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,187
I'm starting to sweat.

115
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,608
It's not the date yet, you're just asking.

116
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,401
That's true.

117
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,337
-Hikaru?
-Yeah?

118
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,051
What's up?

119
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,427
Excuse me...

120
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,514
-Should I leave?
-It's okay.

121
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,558
-It's okay.
-You sure?

122
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,605
What? What' going on?

123
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,482
No, it's okay.

124
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,276
-Well, so...
-What is it?

125
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,864
-You know how we said...
-What?

126
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,366
...that we'd go out on a date?

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,285
-How about the 10th?
-The 10th?

128
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,247
I finally decided.

129
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:37,666
Nice.

130
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,335
I hope you look forward to it.

131
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,171
Well, then...

132
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,132
Where're you going?

133
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,801
I'm going back to the room.

134
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,386
I meant on the 10th?

135
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,723
What? I don't have to tell you now.

136
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,266
-I'm curious.
-Bye.

137
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,476
-You're not going to tell me where?
-No.

138
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,145
-Why?
-Don't worry about it. Bye.

139
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,188
-That was it?
-That was it.

140
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,655
Was that okay?

141
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,657
-It was, right?
-Yeah.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,659
The 10th, huh?

RIKO NAGAI, 18 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

149
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,796
Hansan.

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,216
-Hi.
-Hi to you, too.

151
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,762
-This morning...
-Yeah?

152
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:22,145
Riko asked me
why I said what I did the other day.

153
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,108
-About the loungewear.
-Oh, the talk about the loungewear?

154
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,571
I had totally forgotten about it.

155
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,948
Well, I asked about it later.

156
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,452
Because I didn't know
why she was so upset.

157
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,454
I didn't know...

158
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,501
that she had bought loungewear.

159
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,134
In which case, it may have been better
if you didn't bring it up.

160
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,677
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

161
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,514
It would've been fine
if it was before she bought it.

162
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,308
I'm not sure why it was wrong.

163
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:05,105
Is it really that big of a deal?

164
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,567
I think it was something
that was important to her.

165
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:13,697
It seems silly to me,
but she doesn't get upset that easily.

166
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,326
Misaki tends to make assumptions.

167
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,037
She does that sometimes.

168
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,457
She said I was being mean.

169
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,711
It's a little bothersome, to be honest.

170
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:33,091
I think it's important to say
what you're thinking to each other,

171
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,718
but if it's going to be so bothersome,

172
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,220
I don't care about
other people's relationships.

173
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,642
But this time...

174
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:49,608
I think you need to be more accepting.

175
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,198
The reason is because Misaki...

176
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,035
is truly in love.

177
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,123
And that person was present.

178
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,543
I think.

179
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,922
-Have you two talked?
-No.

180
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,300
It's only going to get worse.

181
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,384
Yea.

182
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,722
If you talk it out,
I'm sure it'll resolve quickly.

183
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,518
I have to hand it to you.

184
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,397
-I'm sorry to interrupt your work.
-It's okay.

185
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,399
-Do you have work tomorrow?
-No.

186
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:36,572
I'm seeing off an old teacher
from high school who's retiring.

187
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,281
That's so nice.

188
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,617
Is that it for tomorrow?

189
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,455
Then I'm coming back to Tokyo
and I'll do some work at my atelier.

190
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,166
Maybe I'll come visit you there.

191
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,293
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

192
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,505
Okay.

193
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:59,344
But I'm just gonna do my work.

194
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,140
-There's nothing I can help with?
-Oh, to help me with?

195
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,019
-I'm sure there's something.
-Okay.

196
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,480
I needed some advice, too.

197
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,235
I'm happy to lend an ear.

198
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,617
Who does she think she is?

199
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,161
Seriously?

200
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,873
-That was a little tough.
-Yeah.

201
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:33,211
The fact that she had forgotten all about
is the scariest thing of all.

202
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:38,050
Both Riko and Hansan
tell her the same thing.

203
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,553
-"I have to hand it to you."
-She did say that.

204
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,513
It's horrifying.

205
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,559
She doesn't know what she did wrong

206
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,852
and says
Misaki makes assumptions.

207
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,855
It's the same thing
that happened with Minori.

208
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:57,695
She thinks Misaki is the one that's wrong
and that she's the victim.

209
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,031
She's the one making assumptions...

210
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:05,035
-but she thinks it's the others.
-Amazing.

211
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,832
While Tamosan puts in so much effort,
fixing her makeup

212
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,710
just to go ask him out on a date.

213
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:17,130
Rikopin is keeping it cool
by saying she's only asking him out.

214
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,883
-It's not the date yet.
-It's not the date yet.

215
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,928
The 18-year-old is the most mature.

216
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,890
Nacchan is a little inept
at social interaction.

217
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,142
She'd make a tough wife.

218
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:35,023
Any small offense could upset her.

219
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,276
She'd get into fights
with the other neighborhood wives.

220
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,032
She'd tell you
what the other wife said to her.

221
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,910
But if you say,
"But I think you were in the wrong there."

222
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,372
She'd be like, "What?
I don't understand. What did I do wrong?"

223
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,041
She's going to create enemies all over.

224
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,420
-"That's going to fester."
-Famous words.

225
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:00,465
She's a good girl when she's not upset.

226
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,293
UENO, TOKYO

227
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,969
-Hansan!
-Yes.

228
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,095
Come in.

229
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,598
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

230
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,101
-It's a mess as usual, but...
-Excuse me.

231
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,856
-A delivery for you.
-What is that?

232
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,318
-A delivery.
-For me?

233
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,445
-Here you go.
-Thanks!

234
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,780
What do you think it is?

235
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,533
Well, it's written in French...

236
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,952
Don't worry about the packaging.

237
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,036
Thank you.

238
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,622
It might be a little cold now, but...

239
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:15,916
Oh, it's my favorite!

240
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,546
But if you've eaten already,
you can have it for dinner.

241
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,591
-I'll heat it up and have some later.
-Please do.

242
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,301
But I'll take fries now. Thanks.

243
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,511
What's this?

244
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,639
That's the job for you.

245
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,642
I was going to have you help with that.

246
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,728
They're dried flowers.

247
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,022
-We use them for architecture models.
-How cute!

248
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,066
It's scaled 200 to one.

249
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,570
If you can just cut off the flowers,
it's easy.

250
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,157
Oh, so they become trees for the models.

251
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,745
-They're trees, right?
-Yeah, with an X-Acto knife.

252
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,790
Like this.

253
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,586
If you don't mind working on that.

254
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,297
You can sit and work on that.

255
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,008
Bon appétit.

256
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,593
Oh, of course.

257
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,267
You mentioned needing advice yesterday.

258
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,858
I'm feeling uncertain
and it's all become a little bothersome.

259
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,569
Living at <i>Terrace House</i> has become tough.

260
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,321
I see.

261
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,950
Do you think I'm just insensitive?

262
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,369
At some basic level...

263
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,958
maybe you don't really realize
how values vary depending on the person.

264
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,459
I do think that at times.

265
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:43,086
-Values?
-Yeah.

266
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,254
Like what?

267
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,758
However you may feel,
the fact Misaki got angry

268
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,886
means you didn't consider her enough.

269
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,220
It depends on each person.

270
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:56,684
How you choose your words
depending on the person...

271
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,479
is something you're supposed to consider.

272
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,612
You said you were going
to support Misaki's romance.

273
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:12,032
That could mean...

274
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:16,745
that there may be times you need to lie,
or hold back for their sake.

275
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,624
I think it means you might have to take on
the dirty job at times.

276
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,709
What?

277
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,129
It's so much trouble.

278
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,385
But this is the time
you should put in the effort.

279
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,556
I think it's a good chance
to reflect on yourself.

280
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,724
Yeah...

281
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,984
Hello?

282
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,737
What're you doing?

283
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,905
Really? You're working?

284
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,491
You're at a café?

285
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,539
Wanna grab dinner together tonight?

286
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:03,626
NISHI-AZABU, TOKYO

287
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,760
I thought over a lot of things.

288
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:17,139
I talked to Hansan about it.

289
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,228
And... I'm sorry.

290
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:29,109
Why did you say what you did?

291
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,361
That's what I was wondering.

292
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,573
If you had done it
in consideration of me...

293
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:40,704
I wish you had asked him
when I wasn't there.

294
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:43,456
It wasn't very considerate of you.

295
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,667
That was my thought.

296
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:51,549
I think I did say things
without considering your feelings.

297
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:54,927
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,013
It's okay.

299
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,059
I'm going on the date on the 10th.

300
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,520
-Maybe you knew already.
-No, I didn't.

301
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm going to tell him how I feel.

302
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,442
You've decided?

303
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,485
I've decided.

304
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,283
How are things lately?

305
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,910
With Hansan?

306
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,082
I went to his atelier,
hoping for some advice.

307
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,585
I made hamburgers.

308
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,669
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

309
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,922
You went to have hamburgers
with him, right?

310
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,842
And he said they were his favorite.

311
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,553
But you don't like him?

312
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:42,474
No, it's not like that right now.

313
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,810
Do you think you could like him?

314
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,730
I'm not sure.

315
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,816
-Of course you could.
-I didn't think so at first.

316
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,777
But maybe I do now.

317
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,572
Definitely.

318
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,243
But don't stir up anything.

319
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,328
I mean, I know I did, but...

320
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,749
-You're the one that stirred things up.
-You're right.

321
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,794
-That's how it was.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

322
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,213
Hilarious.

323
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,298
Hold on.

324
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,259
Are you stupid?

325
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,679
You're the one who stirred thing up.
Are you stupid?

326
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,182
Don't stir things up.

327
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:29,396
It'd be good for her to recognize
her own misconceptions.

328
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,898
For her own future.

329
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,150
Just like how Hansan said,

330
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:38,321
maybe this was a good opportunity
for her to really consider other people.

331
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,074
Within a span of a few months,

332
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,452
there's been two big fights.

333
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,748
That's a good amount.

334
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,167
Which means the fault lies with her.

335
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,961
-That might be true.
-It was the same with Minori.

336
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:57,841
People tend to talk it out
because they're at <i>Terrace House,</i>

337
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:01,094
but if this happened
between friends in ordinary life,

338
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,889
people tend to just go
their separate ways.

339
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,936
So maybe she's never had the opportunity
to realize things.

340
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,231
So coming here, she was able to realize
she needs to talk things out.

341
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,359
I hope she learns from this experience.

342
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,446
I wonder,
but I don't think she really has.

343
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,742
I feel like she's thinking, "Look at me!
I'm compromising, isn't it amazing?"

344
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,787
Maybe.

345
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,122
Like, "I'm apologizing for you."

346
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:33,293
She likes Handa...

347
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,630
and that may have a big role
in her apology.

348
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:37,965
-A huge role.
-Yes.

349
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:41,134
What would've happened
if Handa hadn't been there?

350
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,886
She might have left.

351
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,889
-It's whether she really understands.
-That's right.

352
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:50,310
I don't know. It'll be bad
if things aren't settled this week.

353
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,521
My feelings will be untamed.

354
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:55,273
-You mean your job after this.
-Yes. After this...

355
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,901
I'll be making a lot of noise on YouTube.

356
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,153
Sounds crazy.

357
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,404
It's gonna be bad today.

358
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,825
I can usually hold back on YouTube,
but I don't think I'll be able to.

359
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,790
Where are you going today?

360
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,083
-Today?
-Yeah.

361
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,669
We're going to Yokohama...

362
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:16,962
and...

363
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:22,300
going to a slightly fancy restaurant.

364
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,678
And then...

365
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:26,514
we'll go see the city lights.

366
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,184
I'm going to tell him how I feel there.

367
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,734
-Pretty.
-Okay.

368
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,945
-I'm ready.
-Good luck.

369
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,574
Misaki's totally excited.

370
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:49,286
-She went shopping yesterday.
-Seriously? For what?

371
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,955
I don't know.
Probably an outfit for today.

372
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,624
She went with Nacchan.

373
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,626
I was gonna go dressed like this.

374
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,795
I'm just wearing a hoodie.

375
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,217
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

376
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,474
You look pretty.

377
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,726
-What?
-You look pretty.

378
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,061
-Really?
-Yeah.

379
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,980
Do you mind driving the car today?

380
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,440
Sure.

381
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:19,900
See you, Arman.

382
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:20,984
Later.

383
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,320
See you.

384
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,447
-Have fun.
-Bye.

385
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,374
The Rainbow Bridge.

386
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,086
Yeah, this one.

387
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,964
-It's probably pretty at night.
-Yeah.

388
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,843
Yokohama's known for views
of the city lights.

389
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,095
City lights...

390
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,305
Is that what we're doing?

391
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:56,645
-I haven't said that we are.
-I see.

392
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:57,938
I didn't say that.

393
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:02,776
YOKOHAMA, KANAGAWA

394
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:05,738
-Is this your first time?
-No.

395
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:06,822
You've been here before?

396
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,199
Just once.

397
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,243
You have once?

398
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,621
What about you?

399
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,540
-Is this your first time?
-Yeah.

400
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,753
It is beautiful.

401
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,255
It is.
I like the atmosphere.

402
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,055
-You like Italian food, right?
-Yeah.

403
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,017
But I go to places like Saizeriya.

404
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,980
I get it.
I get nervous in places like this, too.

405
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,231
Let's toast.

406
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,317
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

407
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,241
-Yokohama's beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah, I've never been before.

408
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,662
I thought we could go see
the city lights after this.

409
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,873
I told you.

410
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,668
-So we're gonna go see the lights?
-Yes.

411
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,628
You don't want to?

412
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,212
Okay.

413
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,339
Why do you laugh?

414
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,972
-How is it?
-Tasty?

415
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,559
It's been awhile
since I've had such good meat.

416
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,145
You can have mine.

417
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:26,443
Cut me some?

418
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,613
-This much?
-Yeah.

419
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,377
That was delicious.

420
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,673
I can do another course.

421
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,133
Another whole course.

422
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,802
Wow.

423
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,515
It's pretty.

424
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,894
-The sound of the waves is nice.
-Yeah.

425
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,521
It's calming.

426
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,481
Look, they're kissing.

427
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,692
Guess it's that kind of place.

428
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,322
It's like we're a couple.

429
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,199
-Who?
-Us.

430
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,743
We're not a couple.

431
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,802
I wanted to talk to you.

432
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,473
What is it?

433
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,737
You probably...

434
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,906
You probably...

435
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,784
already noticed.

436
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:10,338
I like you.

437
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,014
In the beginning,

438
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:23,977
I really just liked your face.

439
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,062
But...

440
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,441
after spending time with you,

441
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,068
it's become more than that.

442
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,363
I started seeing
all the good things about you.

443
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,408
Your bad parts, too...

444
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,413
but I still feel I like you.

445
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,635
So, if you feel the same way...

446
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,640
I'd like to go out with you.

447
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:04,977
That's how I feel.
