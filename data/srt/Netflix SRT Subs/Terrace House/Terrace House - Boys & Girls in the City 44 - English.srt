1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,931
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,600
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,185
{\an8}SIX STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
LIVING TOGETHER

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,896
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,315
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,025
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,904
{\an8}-So, last week...
-Yes, yes.

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,323
-It was the biggest shock we've had.
-It was shocking.

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,825
-It caused a panic.
-Yes, a panic.

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,035
A system error.

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,119
Seriously.

12
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:41,291
Riko and Hayato acted as if
they couldn't even hold hands.

13
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,836
Like an innocent couple
taking little steps.

14
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,672
But simply put, they were doing it.

15
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,258
-That's right.
-They were acting innocent,

16
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,972
but Byrnes had already seen them kiss
and couldn't hold back anymore.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,391
So he makes the big reveal.

18
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,688
{\an8}You meet after the rest of us are asleep.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,233
{\an8}When I ran out of the elevator
the other day,

20
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,026
{\an8}I saw you guys kissing.

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,029
{\an8}What you're doing
and what's being said is too different.

22
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,698
{\an8}RIKO NAGAI, 18 YEARS OLD
HAYATO TERASHIMA, 29 YEARS OLD

23
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,074
{\an8}There's a gap.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,286
{\an8}That in itself is fine.

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,707
It's just that they were lying about it.

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,917
Arman was a witness as well.

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,712
Starting about a month ago,

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,089
she'd come in the guy's room
when everyone was asleep,

29
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,466
and leave before everyone woke up.

30
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,511
I noticed you disappearing
about a month ago.

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,681
When I'd wake up around 4:00 a.m.

32
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,018
sometimes Riko would be there.

33
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,941
They're upset because she said
she didn't want to hold hands

34
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,736
and that she wanted
to cherish the relationship.

35
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,658
So if Hayato held your hand,
would you have liked it? Or no?

36
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,910
I didn't want him to.

37
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,412
I want to save things like that.

38
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,624
Especially because we've been
going out on dates.

39
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:08,378
I felt like I wanted to save that.

40
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,214
Normally, you'd want sleep with her
or kiss her or something, right?

41
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,634
You feel that desire toward a woman.

42
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,178
I don't really feel that for her.

43
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,221
-That's right.
-He clearly rejected her.

44
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,015
He has to retract it all.

45
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:27,815
So today, we'll get to hear
what's going on with the two of them.

46
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,566
That's right.

47
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,569
If they can be honest here,

48
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,739
that they were scared
of what would air on <i>Terrace House</i>

49
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,826
and that he was worried
about Riko's career...

50
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,994
I'm sure they'll say something like that.

51
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,581
He's anticipating their move.

52
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,584
That's impossible.

53
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,337
They should've kept it outside.

54
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,588
I'll end it in one move.

55
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,842
But...

56
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,510
let's watch.

57
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,930
But there's also Arman and Masako.

58
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,934
-Tracing back to Arman's accident.
-Yes, the accident.

59
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,686
-Thanks to that...
-His miss.

60
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,190
...it seems to have brought them closer.

61
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,860
{\an8}It's fun hanging out with you.
I wonder why?

62
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,153
{\an8}I feel comfortable with you.

63
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,905
{\an8}You're going back to Hawaii?

64
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,491
{\an8}-Well, I haven't decided when.
-So someday.

65
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,951
{\an8}It's been more fun recently.

66
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,202
{\an8}-Recently?
-Yeah.

67
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,286
{\an8}Why?

68
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,789
{\an8}The train.

69
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,668
{\an8}-Masako doesn't know what happened.
-No, she doesn't.

70
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,671
-That's right.
-She's away for work.

71
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,590
It's the guy she liked.

72
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:40,262
It might be the most shocking for her.

73
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,766
By then, they were already doing it.

74
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,144
-This will make Martha dislike him.
-Yes.

75
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,687
-I'm scared.
-It's scary!

76
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:50,856
I'm afraid.

77
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,861
{\an8}I can't help...

78
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,865
but be aware that I'm on TV.

79
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:05,620
I don't want to think of it this way,
but I think of it as work.

80
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,750
I want to say something about that.

81
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:14,129
Then you really should have
done it more secretly.

82
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,630
So no one would know.

83
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:21,053
If you're going to do it,
you should've done it outside the house.

84
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:26,058
Because we know,
we're forced to play along.

85
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,061
It makes it hard for us, especially
when you're putting on an act.

86
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,689
You haven't been able to hide it.

87
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,150
And for me to have to pretend
to give advice, is just plain stupid.

88
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,238
When you decide to live here,

89
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,701
relationships, arguments...
you expect things to happen.

90
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,912
-We're here with that expectation.
-Yes.

91
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,456
You have feelings for each other,

92
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,626
but to be secretive about it
because of your career...

93
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,005
is the biggest problem.

94
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,467
Yeah.

95
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,306
There is that.

96
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,685
I couldn't help but think about the fact

97
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,481
that my actions would be seen.

98
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,868
What about you, Hayato?

99
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:30,956
I mean Riko's the only one
who's said anything.

100
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,462
I was thinking about Riko's career...

101
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,841
and felt now wasn't the right time
for us to be together.

102
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,679
But I still like her, so things happened.

103
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,477
I overanalyzed things.

104
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,148
But you didn't really think it through.

105
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,359
That's true.
Since things ended up this way.

106
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,196
If you're going to do it, you should
just go to a motel or whatever.

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,992
I don't know,
but somewhere none of us would know.

108
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,702
If you do things halfway,
of course we'd find out.

109
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,746
We live together.

110
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,666
You guys don't like each other?

111
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,461
I do.

112
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,632
But...

113
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,305
we don't trust each other...

114
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,684
100% yet.

115
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,812
You didn't talk about
your feelings beforehand?

116
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,523
You're together so much.

117
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,360
Well?

118
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,112
No, maybe not.

119
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,115
I'm amazed you guys can do it,

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,326
not knowing how you feel
about each other.

121
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,621
You said you couldn't
even hold hands with him.

122
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,125
I thought you guys were kissing
because you've shared your feelings,

123
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,336
but you haven't.

124
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,966
I'm just wondering
how can you even be kissing?

125
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,473
After hearing everything,

126
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,768
it just sounds like the two of you

127
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,689
are convenient sleep buddies
who get to make out when you're home.

128
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,610
That's what it sounds like to me.

129
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,655
-That's...
-I don't like how you're putting it.

130
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:32,202
-It's really--
-But that's what it sounds like.

131
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,620
It's...

132
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,292
It's not like that.

133
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,129
Making out and all,
when you're not together,

134
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,381
is just friends with benefits.

135
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,300
I do like him.

136
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,429
But you said you weren't sure,
even when it's the two of us.

137
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,599
-Like you said here earlier.
-I do like you, but...

138
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,227
So this is what I mean.

139
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,565
If you're still in this status,
how could you kiss her, Hayato?

140
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,903
If you're aware,
then you shouldn't have.

141
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,281
You're right.

142
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,621
-Riko shouldn't have either.
-Yeah, both sides.

143
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,417
But maybe Hayato
should've considered that for her.

144
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,793
-Right.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,711
Before you kissed her.

146
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,796
Yeah.

147
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:32,262
Kissing her may have caused
Riko more confusion.

148
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,973
What we're wondering
is what's going to happen now?

149
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,892
What are you going to do?

150
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,021
But I thought they already knew.

151
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,398
They make out
because they like each other.

152
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,609
But because of her career,
they can't officially be together.

153
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,404
-If that's the case...
-I thought that's what it was.

154
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,242
I do think that's what it is.

155
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,913
I really wanted to be honest.

156
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,500
But as things progressed...

157
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,298
I couldn't say anymore.

158
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,347
You should really talk about it.

159
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,808
Figure out your true feelings
for each other.

160
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,187
You should confirm them with each other.

161
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,108
Because this is tough for us to say, too.

162
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,192
Sorry.

163
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:33,073
Talk it out.
That's what I think.

164
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,244
You coming, Misaki?

00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,012
{\an8}I'm sorry, Riko.

172
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:46,103
I said we shouldn't go out
because of your career.

173
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:51,859
But I guess we made our reputation
a bit worse anyway.

174
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,241
Well, we can't help that anymore.
It's done.

175
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,952
We need to think of what to do.

176
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,872
What do you want to do?

177
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,710
Even if we liked each other...

178
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,715
is it better if we didn't go out?

179
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,553
Or if we really like each other,
is it better if we just go out?

180
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,681
I don't know.

181
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,311
I like you, but...

182
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:33,109
when I consider your career,
maybe now is not the time for us.

183
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695
That's what I think right now.

184
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,617
But what do you want?

185
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,250
If you think we shouldn't go out,
that's fine, too.

186
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:57,467
Even if you like me,
going out isn't everything.

187
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,135
And you're not even sure, right?

188
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,972
It's not that I'm not sure,
maybe I'm just running away from it.

189
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,352
Maybe so,
but that's how you feel right now.

190
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,398
Then we shouldn't go out right now.

191
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,568
And the fact we've kissed
and hung out at night,

192
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,570
we didn't establish boundaries.

193
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,364
Yeah.

194
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,618
So we won't do things halfway anymore.
We won't go out right now.

195
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,788
We'll tell everyone that.

196
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,667
And if your feelings change...

197
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,254
then you can talk about it.

198
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,089
With everyone...

199
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,509
and with me.

200
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,344
That's all we can do, right?

201
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,846
Is that all right?

202
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,393
Yeah.

203
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,746
He's leaving too much to her.

204
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,122
He always asks, "What do you want?"

205
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,500
"What should we do?"
"What do you want?"

206
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,877
This is tough on Riko.

207
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,214
-She's 18.
-He's 29, right?

208
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,298
Yes.

209
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,802
The worst part was
when they were all talking.

210
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,262
He didn't say anything.
He made Riko talk.

211
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,306
All of that is a little...

212
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,853
He should've tried to protect her.

213
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,899
It's not like Riko was the one
kissing him and going to the room.

214
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,736
Even if Riko was the one who liked him,

215
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,322
and she was the one initiating
the kisses and such,

216
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,410
Hayato should've said
that it was the both of them.

217
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:52,206
He couldn't say that it was because
he considered Riko's situation.

218
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,834
I wanted him to take the blame.

219
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,712
Yes, that he took things too far.

220
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,714
I wanted him to say that,
even if it's a lie.

221
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,635
And what was really cold
was when he said,

222
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:09,223
"This might ruin our reputation,
but that can't be helped."

223
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,351
He was suddenly from her agency.

224
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,521
It's like, are you serious?

225
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,648
He's even pettier than Yamazato.

226
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,025
Yeah, we've got a small guy.

227
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,943
We're talking micro-small.

228
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,074
The fact he got up and left first
makes me want to punch him.

229
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,910
Did he go to get the others?

230
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,912
-No, no...
-He just left?

231
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,372
I think he just left.

232
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,082
-I think he went to get the others.
-Really?

233
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,960
He said, that's what we'll tell everyone
and then left...

234
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,424
If not, I'm going to put him a big bag
and send him off.

235
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,261
We'll drop him off at a random place
and be like, "Here you go!"

236
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,142
{\an8}-Hey!
-Hey.

237
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,727
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

238
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,563
I brought souvenirs.

239
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,523
-Thank you.
-It's been awhile.

240
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,608
-It was only two days.
-It was two day, but...

241
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,735
-Look, look.
-What is it?

242
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,820
This is the one from before.

243
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,238
-You've got a big smile.
-Can you tell which one's me?

244
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,323
Second from the right.

245
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,408
-Can you tell?
-Yeah.

246
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,202
-You went to do PR for Kagoshima?
-Yeah.

247
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,789
-Welcome home.
-Welcome back.

248
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,999
Long time no see.
You look tired.

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,251
I'm not tired.

250
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,837
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

251
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,714
I lost my voice.

252
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,257
-You have a cold?
-Yeah, I caught a cold.

253
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,009
Are you all right?

254
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,135
Yeah.

255
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,858
What? What's going on?

256
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,286
-Let's go.
-Okay.

257
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,593
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Let me sit here.

258
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,931
You wanted to talk to me?

259
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,853
My relationship with Hayato...

260
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,898
had been progressing.

261
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,068
What does that mean?

262
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,783
As to how far things have gone...

263
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,618
we've kissed.

264
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,625
Seriously?

265
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,630
My feelings...

266
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,718
I've been lying about them.

267
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:55,264
I've been lying to myself and to everyone.

268
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,933
But Hayato...

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,352
what was he thinking when he kissed you?

270
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:05,357
I'm unsure of his feelings ever since
you guys came back from the fireworks.

271
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,318
So it's hard for me to say.

272
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,195
That was a lie.

273
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,656
Hayato's been lying, too.

274
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,740
Seriously?

275
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm in shock.

276
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,374
All that time...

277
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,921
I've agonized over things.

278
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:31,843
What was the point of me
trying to consider how others felt?

279
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,136
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:40,392
What I did was
really disrespectful to you.

281
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,315
And yesterday,
I really thought things over.

282
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,276
But no matter how much I think about it,

283
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,822
I feel like I know even less.

284
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,367
I can't sleep.

285
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,203
My head is just full.

286
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,331
It feels like my life is over.

287
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,128
You told him you liked him?

288
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,005
For the first time yesterday.

289
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,422
What did Hayato say?

290
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,594
He's always told me he liked me.

291
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,972
What are you going to do?

292
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,058
But Hayato said yesterday

293
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:25,437
that even though he likes me,
considering my career,

294
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,399
we shouldn't be together.

295
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,361
I couldn't really accept it.

296
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,196
No.

297
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,200
It's not very manly of him.

298
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,706
I'm starting to think
he just wants to escape.

299
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,499
Yeah, it's not a good reason.

300
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,211
After making the moves,

301
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,714
and then when you say you like him,

302
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,841
he says no because of your work?

303
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,928
-That's for you to decide.
-Yeah.

304
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,473
Are you okay with that?
You're not going to tell him?

305
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,352
I'll think it over.

306
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,067
I'll talk about it with Hayato.

307
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,870
{\an8}Good morning.

308
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,121
Good morning.

309
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,802
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

310
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,012
I'm so hungry.

311
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,934
How was Kagoshima?

312
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
It was fun.

313
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,439
I wanted to apologize to you.

314
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,234
-A little late, no?
-Yeah.

315
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,611
You're right.
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,950
You were doing this behind our backs.

317
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,035
Who made the first move?

318
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,203
I did.

319
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,250
How do you feel about Riko?

320
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,712
I feel really bad for her.

321
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:17,174
Why do you feel bad?
I mean, you like her, right?

322
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:21,428
I said I was I thinking
about her career

323
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,555
and I really was.

324
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,517
You did,
but you still kiss her behind the scenes?

325
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,396
It turned out the opposite
of what I was thinking.

326
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,900
So you guys are going out now?

327
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,360
I don't know about making a decision...

328
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,405
about that now.

329
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:45,661
If you're so worried about her career,
you shouldn't have made a move.

330
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,206
And if that's the reason,
I won't be able to accept it.

331
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,876
You're just running away.

332
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,628
At least from the girl's point of view.

333
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,674
That's all I have to say.

334
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,384
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,223
You should talk with Riko.

336
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,517
Yeah.

337
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,313
-See you.
-Thanks.

338
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,870
-Welcome back.
-Hey.

339
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,580
Welcome, I'm back.

340
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,623
-Is Hayato here?
-"Welcome, I'm back"?

341
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,834
Is Hayato here?

342
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,668
-Is he downstairs?
-He was downstairs.

343
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,962
-He's downstairs?
-Yeah.

344
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,421
-Thanks.
-Sure.

345
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,176
Are they going to talk?

346
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,095
It's been awhile
since they've seen each other.

347
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,223
Seriously?
Well, it's better to talk soon.

348
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:54,939
Yes?

349
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,569
Riko...

350
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,076
-Alone?
-Yeah.

351
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,079
Are you okay?

352
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,539
Yeah, I'm fine.

353
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,418
-You want to talk?
-Yes, that's why I came.

354
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,295
I wanted to talk too.

355
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,467
I thought it over,

356
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,846
but I liked that I felt like...

357
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,142
I could depend on you
because you're older.

358
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,770
And how when we're with everyone

359
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:39,942
it felt like you treated me special.

360
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,947
I liked that.

361
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,741
I liked it...

362
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,538
and I was okay with going out with you.

363
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,292
But...

364
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:02,214
When you said we shouldn't go out
because of my career...

365
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,760
I thought maybe you were
just running away.

366
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,181
And when we were all talking,

367
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:16,478
I was the only one talking.

368
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,191
You didn't say a word.

369
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:26,030
All that wasn't manly at all.

370
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,451
It's not that I wanted you
to protect me...

371
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,372
or take my side or anything,

372
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:40,794
but you just stayed silent,
which was a shock for me.

373
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,840
Seeing that side of you...

374
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,429
even though I wanted to be with you then,

375
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,849
I became unsure.

376
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,853
And now, I'm not sure what to do.

377
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,108
I see, I'm sorry.

378
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,486
I should have explained then.

379
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,531
From now on...

380
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:17,039
I want you to think about
what you want to do.

381
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,500
Because you're always...

382
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,920
asking me what I want to do.

383
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:31,220
Yeah. I couldn't speak up then,
but I was really thinking about it.

384
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,641
And the fact I didn't protect you...

385
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,310
wasn't manly of me.

386
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,854
I know that.

387
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,525
Right now, I really feel...

388
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:50,156
that we don't have to decide right now
whether or not to be together.

389
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,826
We both have things we need to focus on.

390
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,913
For you, your career.

391
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,165
And me...

392
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,502
I need to focus on
my chef training.

393
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,632
I felt we need to focus on other things.

394
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,264
I had fun,

395
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:20,811
but I know my actions were rash.

396
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,813
I'm really sorry about that.

397
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,694
After thinking about it
with a clear head...

398
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,989
going out right now...

399
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,243
isn't right for either of us.

400
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,957
I see.

401
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,506
That's how far your feelings went.

402
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,096
You acted like you were thinking of me,

403
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,349
but you didn't understand me at all.

404
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,518
Which part?

405
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,896
You're still using work as an excuse.

406
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,773
It's not that I'm running away,

407
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,652
it's just when I thought about
what I really need to do right now...

408
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,073
for me, you didn't come first.

409
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,994
-Yeah.
-Work came first for me.

410
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,998
For you, too.

411
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:28,420
What you need to do...

412
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,298
I don't think I'm first for you either.

413
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:34,635
For me, there's no first or second.

414
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,973
Work is work.
I know what I have to do.

415
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,229
You told me how much you like me.

416
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,524
But to say I'm not first for you...

417
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,693
To put a number on it...

418
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,032
I did like you.
I still have those feelings...

419
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:05,666
But to go out because I like you,
it's not as simple as that.

420
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,502
So...

421
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,673
you were just messing around with me.

422
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,759
Even if that wasn't the case...

423
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm really sad right now.

424
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,979
I can't accept it at all.

425
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,654
I'm going now.

426
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,823
I'm sorry.

427
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,032
Yeah, bye.

428
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,257
Hell.

429
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,093
He's the worst.

430
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,845
So Terashima initiated it.

431
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,224
And he'd been telling her he liked her.

432
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,560
This wasn't right.

433
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,812
So he didn't really like her then.

434
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:13,400
If he did, work wouldn't matter.

435
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,737
He said kissing her was rash.

436
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,698
Disgusting.

437
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,034
He knows the premise of <i>Terrace House.</i>

438
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,663
But he did what he wanted,

439
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:30,501
and kept it a secret
so that it wouldn't affect their image.

440
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:35,213
But when Riko said it'd be okay
if they went out,

441
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,048
he says, "Well, we don't have to go out."

442
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,387
His reasoning was that they both
have other things they need to focus on.

443
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:47,226
It's not like he's in love with her
and wants to go out with her,

444
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,646
but he couldn't help himself.
I totally get it as a guy.

445
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,857
{\an8}Like Yoshida from the comedy duo
<i>Black Mayonnaise</i> says,

446
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,360
{\an8}the brain and penis are constant rivals
for a man.

447
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,071
The brain and penis are constant rivals.

448
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,240
They're always battling.

449
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,867
Sometime the brain wins,
and sometimes the penis wins.

450
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,537
According to Yoshida.
I have to agree with that.

451
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,996
-How difficult for you.
-Yes.

452
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,998
So I get it.

453
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,710
But his behavior when they all talked,

454
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:18,382
all of that was not very manly.

455
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,884
The way he did it was bad.

456
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,719
Do you think the girls
are talking about it?

457
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,306
-Like, "Isn't he the worst?"
-Yes, definitely.

458
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,558
The girls definitely feel that way.

459
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,685
So it's five against one.

460
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,438
I want to see a five against one.

461
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,701
Good morning.

462
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,369
We're wearing matching shirts.

463
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,830
-What?
-We have matching shirts.

464
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,291
-Does it look bad?
-No, it looks good.

465
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,544
-I've never seen you dressed like that.
-Seriously?

466
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,046
Are you hungry?

467
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,673
-What?
-Are you hungry?

468
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,217
No, not really.

469
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,428
Did I tell you where we're going?

470
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,012
-No.
-I haven't?

471
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,181
-Then it'll be a surprise.
-Okay.

472
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,935
{\an8}KAMAKURA, KANAGAWA

473
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,937
KAMAKURA STATION

474
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,356
It's so hot!

475
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,274
-It's so hot.
-Yeah.

476
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,736
-There are so many people.
-Breezy, though.

477
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,987
It's super hot.

478
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,701
{\an8}YUIGAHAMA BEACH

479
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,123
We should get a drink.

480
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,125
-You want to drink?
-Ice cold beer?

481
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,877
-I don't want to.
-I want to.

482
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,294
I drink every day,
so I don't want to.

483
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,880
You should drink though.

484
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,844
-It's hot. It's beautiful though.
-Yeah.

485
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,596
I want to do that!

486
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,309
Yeah!

487
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,358
{\an8}THAI VILLAGE

488
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,653
{\an8}-Cheers.
-Cheers.

489
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,489
{\an8}-Sorry, I drank already.
-No worries.

490
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,285
Can you surf here?

491
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,913
I think so.
But I've never done it here.

492
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,665
-We should go together.
-What?

493
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,082
-We should go surfing.
-Surfing?

494
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,126
You can teach me.

495
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,423
-Looks delicious.
-It looks so good!

496
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,091
There's only a week left.

497
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,344
It's sad.

498
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,263
-Don't say it.
-Sorry.

499
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,016
We should keep it fun.

500
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,935
But, what are you going to do?

501
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,687
I need to decide.

502
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,566
Either at the beginning of September,
or the middle...

503
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,446
I might go back to Hawaii.

504
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,739
I haven't decided yet though.

505
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,824
I see.

506
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,123
-Should we walk around some more?
-Sure.

507
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,208
When you're done.

508
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,676
{\an8}TENNOZU ISLE

509
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,136
{\an8}Let's go on a boat.

510
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,472
{\an8}-A boat? Seriously?
-A boat.

511
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,182
{\an8}-Where is it?
-On a cruise. I'm not sure.

512
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,392
Seriously?
We get on here?

513
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,019
I'm okay with that.

514
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,691
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

515
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,067
This is nice.

516
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,819
-Oh, man.
-It's nice.

517
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,320
Man...

518
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,947
This is cute.

519
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,116
Arman, your eyes are half-closed.

520
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,284
Your eyes are half-closed!

521
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,871
-Your eyes are half-closed.
-I look dead.

522
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,344
It's nice.
You look good in casual wear.

523
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,846
-Who?
-You.

524
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,266
What?

525
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,395
It's funny
because you say it out of nowhere.

526
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,981
It's sudden.
It's amazing we're on a boat.

527
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,399
Thank you.

528
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,193
-Kintaro.
-Oh, thank you.

529
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,695
On the rocks.

530
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,280
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

531
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,282
On the rocks.

532
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,701
We both have dark features

533
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,370
-but our choices are traditional Japanese.
-There's definitely a gap.

534
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,915
Oh, the Tokyo Tower.

535
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,043
Where?

536
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,211
-That's the Sky Tree.
-Oh, the Sky Tree.

537
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,838
That's the Sky Tree.

538
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,218
When the sun sets more,
it'll be even more beautiful.

539
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,221
-When it's darker?
-Yeah.

540
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,765
I'm sure it'll be beautiful.

541
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,975
Yeah. It's pretty now, too.

542
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:46,316
I was going to say this
when it got darker.

543
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,234
But today...

544
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,615
The airplane.

545
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,454
We've been hanging out more lately.

546
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,959
It's been really fun for me.

547
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,838
Right now, we're like friends.

548
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,047
It's how we started.

549
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,343
I...

550
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:18,348
want to take things further.

551
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,353
-So...
-What?

552
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,901
It's fun being with you.

553
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,071
Will you go out with me?

554
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,575
Right now?
You're asking now?

555
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,744
-Was it too soon?
-No, it's not, but...

556
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,996
I've been wanting to ask.

557
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,709
I like you too, probably.

558
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,043
I like you.

559
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,087
-Me?
-I like you, Arman.

560
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,883
But you're going back to Hawaii.

561
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,052
That bothers me.

562
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,517
I do wonder what you think about that.

563
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,648
I have things
I need to take care of there.

564
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,485
I can always come back after.

565
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,656
I can go for a few months and come back.

566
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,660
But I really like you.

567
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,913
If we went out for a month

568
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,667
and if I felt like I can't leave,
then I won't leave.

569
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,003
I can stay in Japan.

570
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,088
-You like me that much?
-That much.

571
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,299
I've thought it through.

572
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,056
Will you believe me?
