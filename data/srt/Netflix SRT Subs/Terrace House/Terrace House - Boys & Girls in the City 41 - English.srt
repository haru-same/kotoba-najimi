1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,889
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,684
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,268
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,896
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,065
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,984
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,653
So last week...

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>Hayato and Martha cooked together.</i>

9
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,577
<i>-He was teaching her.</i>
<i>-Yes, he was.</i>

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,704
How is it?

11
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,288
It's fine.

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,082
You've gone out several times, right?

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,710
But she's like a younger sister.

14
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,505
-You don't see her as a woman yet?
-Maybe I don't see her as a woman yet.

15
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,842
After the summer pasta...

16
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,385
<i>came the summer foreplay.</i>

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>-That's right.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,475
-Riko's mom visited.
-That's right.

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,854
She seemed to get along rather well
with Terashima.

20
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,439
They had previously spoken over the phone

21
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,360
and had a little conversation.

22
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,739
She was giving off a vibe of,
"Look how he gets along with my daughter."

23
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,825
So even when it comes to Riko,

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,827
he seems to be very caring.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,498
That's the impression I had.

26
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,250
He seems very nice.

27
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:29,131
Misaki and Byrnes
might make it official this week.

28
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,049
-It's so cute.
-I wanna see it happen!

29
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,718
He finally got his license.

30
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,596
But his attempt at surprising her
was terrible.

31
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,264
Are you free on Friday?

32
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,349
Friday? I am.

33
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,977
Let's go somewhere.

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,813
I'll drive.

35
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:50,152
Everybody tells me I shouldn't go
to Yokohama because of that.

36
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,195
-But it doesn't matter, does it?
-No.

37
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,823
I was going to tell her how I feel there.

38
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,366
What? You haven't already?

39
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,160
-Not yet.
-I see.

40
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,953
I wonder if they'll date this week.

41
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,039
He did some research
by watching Netflix.

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:07,085
<i>I wonder what kind of date he'll plan</i>
<i>after having watched that.</i>

43
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:11,089
He purposefully chose the place
even though she may not like it.

44
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,719
It's like, "Go ahead and remember.
I'll take care of you."

45
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,932
-He's so cool!
-Well, he hasn't said that yet.

46
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,312
That was me. That was me.
The mom! The mom!

47
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,777
-You're leaving soon?
-Yeah, I am.

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,029
At...

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,405
noon.

50
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,450
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

51
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,786
You look so cute!

52
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,871
-Nice.
-Good morning.

53
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,122
It looks amazing.

54
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,499
Thanks. Is this for me?

55
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:50,212
I made it.
I figured you'd be coming down.

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,340
-You know...
-You wore the dress.

57
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,301
It looks good on you.

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,220
You look different.

59
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,682
-It's a totally different look.
-Yeah, totally different!

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,308
-You got a hair cut.
-Thanks.

61
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,185
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

62
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,396
-He was ready way earlier than you.
-Yeah.

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,357
Shall we?

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,441
Shall we go?

65
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,652
Do you have your license?

66
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,153
Hold on...

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,365
What?

68
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,952
I've got it.

69
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,169
-The beginner sticker.
-I have to put the sticker on.

70
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,718
-On the back, too?
-Yes.

71
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm excited.

72
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,767
It feels kinda strange.

73
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,477
Are you sure you're okay?

74
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,148
-And we're off!
-We're off! Let's go.

75
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,570
I'm so happy that I'm finally driving.

76
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,406
Yeah, you worked hard.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,577
-The highway!
-The highway!

78
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,662
Already?

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,705
-You'll be okay.
-Totally.

80
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,956
Believe in yourself.

81
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,962
You're totally fine.

82
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,676
This leads to the Rainbow Bridge, right?

83
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,093
It does.

84
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,556
-Oh, no!
-The Rainbow Bridge!

85
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,724
Yes! The Rainbow Bridge!

86
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,477
Here comes the Rainbow Bridge.

87
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,355
-I wanna see--
-It's super pretty.

88
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,691
Wish I could see.

89
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,030
Where are we going?

90
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,824
-You can't guess, can you?
-No.

91
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,369
YUIGAHAMA, KANAGAWA

92
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,873
-Too bad it's not sunny today.
-Yeah.

93
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,000
What are you doing?

94
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,087
I was making a funny face!

95
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,630
-Not at all.
-Really?

96
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,340
You weren't.

97
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh, you were.

98
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,350
-Wow!
-It's so nice here.

99
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,416
-We're here.
-We're here!

100
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,066
I'm glad I didn't know the consequences--
Consequences? I didn't mean that.

101
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,902
Not consequences...

102
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,573
-You mean where we're going?
-Yeah.

103
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:27,911
I had to think about it, though,
since I messed up last time.

104
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,830
-The surprise?
-Yeah.

105
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,292
But looking back at it all,
it'll be a nice memory.

106
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,503
Yeah.

107
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,755
-Here it is.
-You can start.

108
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,172
-Can I?
-Of course.

109
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,549
Bon appétit.

110
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,637
-Tasty?
-Yeah.

111
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,180
Is this all we're doing today?

112
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,101
Are we going somewhere else?

113
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,186
-Is it okay if we do?
-Sure.

114
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,357
So many secrets today.

115
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:04,156
Sorry for not telling you
where we're going.

116
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,741
It's okay. I'm having fun.

117
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,037
-Are we almost there?
-What?

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,665
-Are we almost there?
-I don't know.

119
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,003
This is...

120
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,549
Yokohama.

121
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,717
-What?
-It's Yokohama.

122
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,802
Yeah.

130
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,229
I had so much fun today.

131
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,272
-Did you have fun?
-I had fun.

132
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,818
-Did I seem like I wasn't?
-No, not at all.

133
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,570
It was super fun.

134
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,490
-I'm sorry I brought you to Yokohama.
-I'm totally fine.

135
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,328
It's already in the past for me.

136
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,290
Yes.

137
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,669
And...

138
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:49,427
There's something I wanted to tell you.

139
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,015
Hanging out with you...

140
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,601
is so much fun.

141
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,647
I find myself wanting to come home
after work.

142
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,319
Because we live together...

143
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,407
I see so many of your good qualities.

144
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,078
I like you.

145
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,255
I want you to...

146
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,050
go out with me.

147
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,429
I like you, too.

148
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,976
Yeah.

149
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,029
-What?
-I'm looking forward to this.

150
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,831
You laugh too much.

151
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,083
-Did my stubble hurt you?
-It did.

152
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,673
I'm so glad. I like Yokohama now.

153
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,303
-Do you really like me?
-I really like you.

154
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,680
Seriously.

155
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,932
-Really?
-Yeah.

156
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,893
I'm glad.

157
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,067
-They're back.
-What? No way.

158
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,527
-Here they come.
-They're here.

159
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,195
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

160
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,032
-Welcome back.
-Hey, you-- I mean Misaki.

161
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,284
-"You"?
-Sorry.

162
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,705
That outfit... You went in that outfit?

163
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,790
-It's so cute!
-I did.

164
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,792
It was so much fun.

165
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,880
So where did you go?

166
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,090
-Yokohama.
-Yokohama?

167
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,845
-You told him, didn't you?
-Why?

168
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,264
I asked her to go steady with me.

169
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,853
-Seriously?
-Seriously?

170
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,688
He asked me to go steady.

171
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,356
-Wait, wait.
-Seriously?

172
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,734
But your reaction...

173
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,861
gives away the answer.

174
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,405
We're going out now.

175
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,366
Congratulations!

176
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,953
-That's so fun.
-It's hilarious.

177
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:21,914
Congrats!

178
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,042
-I'm happy for you. Congrats.
-Why didn't you say that right away?

179
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,587
-We're together now.
-Nice work!

180
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,089
Right?

181
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,091
She said yes.

182
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,554
So you're moving
to the Japanese-style room?

183
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,347
Not tonight.

184
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,433
-Not yet.
-Not yet?

185
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,646
I'm so glad!

186
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,982
I'm so glad for them.

187
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:53,320
There were several moments
that made my heart pound.

188
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,282
-Which ones?
-They were already having fun in the car.

189
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:02,287
When they were walking with their phones,
their shoulders would brush.

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,289
Even that's...

191
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,793
Yeah, that would recharge me by 86%.

192
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,337
-Yes, I was recharged.
-Powerful...

193
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,967
And after their talk,
during their walk back,

194
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,260
the way he said he really likes her.

195
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:22,933
Like, "I really like you."
The way he said it!

196
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,354
For those of you who couldn't see,
Tokui was standing up and pacing.

197
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,816
He was going wild over here,
practically dancing.

198
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,026
Totally wild.

199
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,238
Just prancing around.

200
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,162
This is the good stuff!

201
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,248
This is the good stuff!

202
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:51,003
And when they were sitting
with the Ferris wheel in front of them...

203
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,713
-It was so pretty.
-It showed the time,

204
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,298
so I'm sure they'll remember that moment
down to the minute.

205
00:11:55,966 --> 00:12:00,428
"We started going out on this day,
at this hour and this minute."

206
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:03,098
The way Byrnes said he likes her,

207
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,976
it really feels like
it's overflowing from him.

208
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,479
-Yes, it did.
-It was so natural and nice.

209
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,817
What?

210
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,485
I'm sorry--

211
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,031
You're always over
in our living room watching TV...

212
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,115
Why?

213
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,786
Maybe I should go home then.

214
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,038
Should I go home?

215
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,208
Going camping with everyone!

216
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,044
-What should we do?
-Should we take it?

217
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,337
We should put beer in the cooler.

218
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,464
Meat?

219
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,842
Wait.

220
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,469
-Should we take that?
-Yeah.

221
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,766
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

222
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,893
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

223
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,645
-Where's Yuuki?
-Yuuki?

224
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,439
Good morning.
You're already wearing a hat?

225
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,817
What's wrong with that?

226
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,736
Oh, do we need this?

227
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,947
-Let's take the garlic.
-Do we need it?

228
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,324
-Why don't we...
-We can put the meat there.

229
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,868
I can't understand
when you all talk at once.

230
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,540
It's sunny, sunny. The sun is out.

231
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,833
It is sunny.

232
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,501
What do you want to do?

233
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,086
Jump in the water.

234
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,379
-And maybe fireworks?
-Fireworks sound nice.

235
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,674
-Fireworks are so fun.
-I've wanted to do that.

236
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,927
-Guys look good when they're driving.
-Yeah.

237
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,929
Thank you very much.

238
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,556
You too, Hayato.

239
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,601
-Oh, you mean Yuuki.
-Yuuki.

240
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,853
-I see what you're doing.
-She's doing it.

241
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,354
Lovey-dovey already.

242
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,190
I'm looking forward to camping.

243
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,238
You're taking pictures?

244
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,115
-Looks good.
-Does it?

245
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,535
Everyone's looking good.
I'm gonna snap away.

246
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:52,499
FOREST SONS NAGATORO
NAGATORO, SAITAMA

247
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,251
Oh, man...

248
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,503
It's nature.

249
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:56,795
Negative ions.

250
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,131
-Negative ions?
-Yeah.

251
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,552
Are there negative ions? I guess so.

252
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,804
-Is this it?
-This is it.

253
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,893
We take off our shoes, right?

254
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,020
-We're here.
-Home sweet home.

255
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,479
-Home sweet home.
-Home sweet home.

256
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,899
-It's nice.
-It smells like my grandma's place.

257
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,568
Wow!

258
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,278
Crazy.

259
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,280
It smells like wood.

260
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,907
-Wow.
-This is crazy.

261
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,867
Wood smells amazing.

262
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,911
-Wow.
-There's a lot.

263
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,579
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

264
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,707
-Oh, the beds!
-Wow, wow, wow!

265
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,250
Amazing.

266
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,128
-Wow, there's a balcony!
-It's the new girls' room.

267
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,549
Nice.

268
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,892
Put your weight on it. Yes, yes.

269
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,811
-Are you ready? I'm letting you go.
-Wait.

270
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,188
Stay centered.
Put your weight on the center.

271
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,355
Look!

272
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,900
Look, look, look!

273
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,401
I did it!

274
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,072
Good job.

275
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,163
I can kick flip.

276
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,712
How cool!

277
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,881
She said he's cool! She keeps bragging.

278
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,174
We heard it.

279
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,468
-We heard it.
-It's been heard.

280
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,826
Be careful. Go slow.

281
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,996
-Can you go?
-Yeah.

282
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,288
I can go.

283
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,210
What's that?

284
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,170
They're going down the river.

285
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,214
-Oh, man.
-I want to do that!

286
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,049
Wave to them, Riko.

287
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,012
They're waving back.

288
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,639
Hey!

289
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,850
-That looks ready.
-Looks so good!

290
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,184
Cheers.

291
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,646
Should we welcome Martha?

292
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,188
-Oh, yeah.
-That's right!

293
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,733
It's also a welcome for Martha.

294
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,192
Welcome to <i>Terrace House.</i>

295
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,861
-Welcome!
-Thank you!

296
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,404
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

297
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,574
Is it on me?

298
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,285
-It's on your face.
-Bon appétit.

299
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,246
Delicious.

300
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,293
-Hey, the watermelon is drifting away!
-What?

301
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,337
-Oh, the watermelon!
-Arman!

302
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,090
-Get it, Arman!
-Arman!

303
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,719
You got it!

304
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,393
Hey, stop that! Seriously!

305
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,729
He's being annoying!

306
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,067
Seriously, stop!

307
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,735
It's hot.

308
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,362
The water's nice, huh?

309
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,576
Stop grinning so much.

310
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,455
-Is it done?
-I think so.

311
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,376
-It's good!
-Still a little warm.

312
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,461
Delicious.

313
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,797
I need to use the restroom.

314
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,633
I'll go with you.

315
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,679
Wanna go? We're going to the bathroom.

316
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,973
-I'm okay.
-You're joining the girls?

317
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,558
A bathroom break.

318
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,351
What's going on?

319
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,104
I don't have a clue. Doesn't matter.

320
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,107
-She's pretty mad.
-She's mad about something.

321
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,984
She's mad about something.

322
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,570
-Do you know, Arman?
-What?

323
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,738
Not really.

324
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,824
You know how Yuuki's got his camera?

325
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,451
There was a picture of his ex on it.

326
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,204
Yeah, from four years ago.

327
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,291
It's from when I first bought the camera.

328
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,503
-Misaki saw it.
-She just did.

329
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,337
That's why she's acting like that?

330
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,758
It's my fault for not erasing it.
Seriously.

331
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,427
Why did this happen
while we're having so much fun?

332
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,435
What is it?

333
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,398
I don't know why I'm crying.

334
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,483
I don't know.

335
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,071
I don't know. Is it jealousy?

336
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,658
-I get it. I totally get it.
-Is it jealousy?

337
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,660
You're upset at yourself
for even getting upset.

338
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,452
Yes, that's it! Yes!

339
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:42,748
-You're crying from that frustration.
-Yes!

340
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,916
-I get it.
-I'm so frustrated!

341
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,709
The timing isn't good either.

342
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,629
I'm so frustrated!

343
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:53,175
I know the past is the past,
and he told me he likes me.

344
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,135
So that feeling...

345
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,721
I need to just accept it.

346
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:00,933
And I realized I really like him.

347
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:06,564
So I'm...

348
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,525
I'm frustrated and sad...

349
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,944
and jealous?

350
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,825
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

351
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,994
This is seriously the best.

352
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,082
Today was fun.

353
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,713
-Were you able to have fun?
-I did.

354
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,048
All of us usually don't get to hang out.

355
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,217
-It's the first time.
-Yeah, probably.

356
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,678
-What are you going to do, Yuuki?
-I'll apologize.

357
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,054
You will?

358
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,181
Yeah, you should.

359
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,142
-I just want to see her.
-Shut up!

360
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,436
-You've been saying that.
-Go see her.

361
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,731
You guys already started.

362
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,984
Hey.

363
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,237
-Hey.
-Hey. It's warm here.

364
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,281
-It's hot.
-Wow.

365
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,578
We didn't bring our drinks.

366
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,081
It's hot.

367
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,166
It's warm.

368
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,586
But it's nice for the evening.

369
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,380
-Are you drinking?
-I am.

370
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,800
-Want some?
-Sure.

371
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,052
-Bug spray?
-I haven't put on any.

372
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,187
Let's go talk, Misaki.

373
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,611
Let's go.
Sorry, we're gonna step out for a bit.

374
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,162
-The sparks fly.
-It's dangerous.

375
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,581
-We should scoot back.
-It was fine earlier.

376
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,707
Really?

377
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,918
Wanna go inside, Martha?

378
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:52,920
Where?

379
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:55,088
To the house.

380
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,339
Okay.

381
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,091
-Want a beer?
-You're leaving?

382
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,220
Bye.

383
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,393
Why isn't anyone else coming?

384
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,398
-How's the campfire?
-It's nice.

385
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,651
I haven't sat around one
since junior high.

386
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,320
It's really burning.

387
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,073
Sorry about earlier.

388
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,075
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,492
I'm really sorry.

390
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:27,538
I promise that kind of thing
won't happen again.

391
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,332
I want to believe you...

392
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,668
but there's still a part of me
that doesn't.

393
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:37,297
And that frustrates me.

394
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,342
The more I like you...

395
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,885
I'm kinda...

396
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,973
The more insecure I become
about different things.

397
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:50,268
After you left,
I wanted to see you so bad.

398
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,564
I realized...

399
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,942
how much I really like you.

400
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,485
Me, too.

401
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,739
-I realized how much I like you.
-I really thought that.

402
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,324
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,286
-I'm sorry.
-I just have to believe you.

404
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,879
Why did everyone leave?

405
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,715
I don't know.

406
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,095
Look.

407
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,140
What did they say they're doing?

408
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,350
I don't know.

409
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,235
Are we...

410
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,738
going to go on another date?

411
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,616
-What?
-Don't you think about going out again?

412
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,243
Why?

413
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:53,331
I was just wondering. There's...

414
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,252
somewhere I want to go.

415
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,130
-Somewhere you want to go?
-Well, I mean...

416
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,384
a festival or to see fireworks.

417
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,221
-That's where you want to go?
-Yeah.

418
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,141
With who?

419
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,643
With you.

420
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,104
You said we'd have to be going out.

421
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:19,567
That was my ideal situation.

422
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,860
It was just...

423
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,447
something I had in my head.

424
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,242
-You've changed your mind?
-Yeah.

425
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,538
You sure you're okay it's with me?

426
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,082
Yeah.

427
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:42,297
There are better guys for you.

428
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,467
Not right now.

429
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,263
I want to go with you.

430
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,517
Let's go then.

431
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,108
Then let's wear yukatas...

432
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,279
and either go see fireworks
or go to a festival.

433
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,865
Sure.

434
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:09,533
Let's go.

435
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,958
-It's nice.
-What is?

436
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,418
-What's nice?
-It's nice. It's fun.

437
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,715
It is fun.

438
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,341
It is fun, but...

439
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,681
Since I got here, I've only met girls
who try to cater to the guys.

440
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:37,435
Of all the girls I met here,
not many would say what's on their mind.

441
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,023
Living with you,
I realized you're the first.

442
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,650
-You mean my personality?
-Yeah.

443
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,568
And you're cute, too.

444
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:49,740
Out of all the girls that have been here,
I think you're the cutest.

445
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,743
I'm serious. Why are you laughing?

446
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,578
-Arman!
-What?

447
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,623
So...

448
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,499
let's go somewhere together.

449
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,419
Will you?

450
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:06,214
Will I?
Don't get all embarrassed after asking.

451
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,467
I'm okay with that.

452
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:11,094
-You are?
-Yeah.

453
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,430
Thanks.

454
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,225
I'll think about it.

455
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,687
I didn't know you were like this.

456
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,566
You'll think about it?
Oh, you mean where we'll go.

457
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,702
I wonder what Riko and Hayato
are talking about.

458
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,829
I don't know.

459
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,755
Oh, for Martha this is...

460
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,467
Wait, wait. Let's start at the beginning.

461
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,511
-We have to organize.
-Yes.

462
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:54,847
-Summarize.
-Yes.

463
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,474
It's like you said.

464
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,186
No matter what happens,
it's all just spice.

465
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,731
-Things have gotten hotter.
-Yes.

466
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:06,066
"I realized I really like you."
"Me, too."

467
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,739
-It doesn't happen like that too often.
-It's amazing.

468
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,616
And Riko...

469
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,827
We thought she might withdraw,

470
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,538
but she bent her own rules.

471
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:23,834
-She's maturing well.
-Hayato tried to play games with her.

472
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,711
-Games?
-He was just embarrassed.

473
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,962
I wonder what it was.

474
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,798
He told her there are better guys for her.

475
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:33,552
Why do guys say things like that?
When do you say that?

476
00:26:33,636 --> 00:26:37,681
It's the whole, "With who?"
"With you."

477
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,017
He wants her to say it.

478
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,935
It's a little effeminate.

479
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,354
At the end, he was like, "Let's go."

480
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,024
Yeah, abruptly.

481
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:51,111
-Are you sure?
-Who do you want to go with?

482
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,863
-With you.
-You sure?

483
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:53,947
Yes, I'm sure.

484
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:55,658
Let's go!

485
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,868
What happened?

486
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,120
It's so abrupt!

487
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,706
That was a little abrupt.

488
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:08,546
I thought that maybe his feelings for her
had changed,

489
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:12,465
that maybe he was starting to like Martha.

490
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:17,179
But the way he was saying "Is it on me?"

491
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,599
What do you think?

492
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:25,145
-The way Riko stuck out her arms was cute.
-It was so cute.

493
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,855
Although it's dangerous to do
so close to the fire.

494
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,941
Well, yes. You've got a point.

495
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,318
You should really keep a safe distance.

496
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:36,114
Stop the lovey-dovey stuff.
He's got to notice the details.

497
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,490
He's an adult after all.

498
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:40,493
Are you from the Boy Scouts?

499
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:43,205
It can be dangerous if it sparks.

500
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,999
I understand. I'm sorry.

501
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,544
As long as you're aware.
Otherwise, enjoy camping.

502
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:50,796
Okay.

503
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:56,176
And then Arman,
using consideration as an excuse,

504
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,053
took Martha aside.

505
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,514
That was tough for Martha.

506
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:02,224
It must have been hard on her.

507
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:05,018
Arman's being unusually aggressive.

508
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:08,021
His timing is bad.

509
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,149
-It's probably because of the flames.
-Yes.

510
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,486
Flames from a campfire
can lead people astray.

511
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,406
It helps boost things
that are already going well.

512
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,325
But it also got hot
in unintentional places.

513
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,244
It makes you think you can go for it.

514
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,496
-It's summertime.
-It is summertime.

515
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,375
-It's summer.
-We're being shown summertime.

516
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,711
Can I end this summer
without doing anything?

517
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,298
Should we light fireworks?

518
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,134
I'll go get them.

519
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,303
I'll go, too.

520
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,317
What's wrong?

521
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,072
Does it have to do with Arman?

522
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,826
Yeah...

523
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,662
It's nothing.

524
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,666
He asked we go somewhere
after we get back from camping.

525
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,250
He asked, but...

526
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,423
Well...

527
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,053
And you, Riko?

528
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:25,223
-Did you talk to him?
-I did.

529
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:30,312
I asked him out on a date.

530
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,147
I see.

531
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:36,694
Then...

532
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,698
he asked if it's okay that it's him.

533
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:46,286
So he still had Yuuki in mind?

534
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:50,791
He said there are better guys out there.

535
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,042
Or so he said.

536
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,212
-But you told him there isn't.
-I told him there isn't.

537
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,342
I see.

538
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,104
-Just rip it open.
-How do I open it?

539
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,733
-Fireworks!
-Let's start with an easy one.

540
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,155
Hold it at the bottom.

541
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,909
Go, go! Let's all do it.
Let's do it together.

542
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,911
-You're gonna start with that one?
-Oh, wow!

543
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,872
-Wow, scary.
-It's safe.

544
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,874
-Beautiful.
-Yeah!

545
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,961
Smells like fireworks.

546
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,921
The smoke's coming this way.

547
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,757
Here are some sparklers.
