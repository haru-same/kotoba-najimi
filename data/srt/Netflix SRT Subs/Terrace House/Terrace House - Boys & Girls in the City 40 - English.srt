1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,725
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,393
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:21,042
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,481
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,318
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,903
So last week...

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,282
-a new member moved in.
-That's right.

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,492
She's extremely bold.

10
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,745
I liked Hayato.

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,121
MASAKO ENDO, 22 YEARS OLD

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,710
Why? Why?

13
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,461
What's with that reaction?

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,254
Is that bad?

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:51,093
We'll see how she affects
Riko and Terashima's relationship.

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,136
-That's true.
-Yes.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,766
Riko was just like, "Oh, Hayato, I see."

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,685
That was her response.

19
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,645
Yes, she hasn't said anything yet.

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,565
-And there was the legendary doggy paddle.
-That's right.

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,191
Arman's only skill.

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:10,112
<i>The one skill Arman has displayed</i>
<i>on</i> Terrace House.

23
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>An extremely stable doggy paddle.</i>

24
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:16,535
Afterwards, he invited Martha on a date.

25
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,581
-When you're free, we should go out.
-Sure.

26
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,126
The fact that he asked caused some issues.

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:29,256
Yes, then Hayato said, "That's good."
"It's good? It's good..."

28
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,966
-That exchange.
-Yes.

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,926
Do you cook?

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,011
Well...

31
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,889
I'm sure it doesn't compare to you.

32
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,391
-Teach me something.
-Sure.

33
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,603
But for now, since Arman asked,
I'll go out with him.

34
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:43,958
That's good.

35
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,313
-It's good.
-It's good.

36
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,565
It's good.

37
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,484
It's all good.

38
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,613
-She came on strong.
-It's rather refreshing.

39
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,909
I wonder if Terashima realized it.
Like, "Oh, is she coming on to me?"

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,786
I wonder about that, too.

41
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,998
If he was perceptive,
he should've immediately noticed it.

42
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:08,211
But maybe Terashima is not as experienced
as he seems.

43
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,256
At least that's what my agent said
on the way here.

44
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,344
Even my 26-year-old agent
noticed that about him.

45
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,515
-So maybe he hasn't noticed.
-I see.

46
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,602
Riko needs to make a move.
She's been a little too passive.

47
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,814
But she did tell her friend

48
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,735
that she knew
she had to do something about it.

49
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,864
-But I don't think he'll ask me out again.
-Really?

50
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:40,493
So I think I'll have to do something
about that.

51
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:44,372
You're competing against each other
with the denim look today.

52
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,333
We're competing?

53
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,044
-He wins!
-That was too quick! Too quick!

54
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,379
That was way too quick.

55
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,508
-And Kentaro is in a lovely yukata.
-Yes, very nice.

56
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,095
Tokui said something interesting earlier.

57
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,764
-It made no sense at all.
-Will you please repeat it?

58
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,226
I really want to touch his man parts.

59
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,353
What?

60
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,606
-What the heck is he saying?
-Are you crazy?

61
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,776
Seeing young Kentaro in his yukata

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,531
makes me nostalgic
for the fleeting summers of my youth.

63
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,908
I remember them,

64
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,870
but I'd like to recall them more directly.

65
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,955
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,790
I want to connect to them more directly.

67
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:31,920
Right now, I'm connected to my memories
via Bluetooth.

68
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,423
-Yes, like Bluetooth.
-I'd like to be wired into the circuit.

69
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:39,637
-We grew up in the age of wired circuits.
-Yes, that's right.

70
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,805
So we'd prefer something more direct.

71
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,686
It's the same as
when I touch Torichan's chest.

72
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,231
-It's the same thing.
-Oh, I see how it is.

73
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,276
If he touches Kentaro's penis,

74
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,612
he'll be like, "I remember now."

75
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,822
-Like psychometry?
-Yes, exactly.

76
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,574
That's how you remember?

77
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,202
-How does that work?
-I can travel back to that summer.

78
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,829
The key is the man parts.

79
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,624
There's something wrong with you guys.

80
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,292
What the heck is this?

81
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,796
-That was a nice story.
-No, it wasn't.

82
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,631
Don't try to find a happy ending.

83
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,509
-She's been taught well.
-I don't think so.

84
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,011
How would Taylor Swift feel having to sing
after this conversation?

85
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,435
Have you talked a lot to the guys yet?

86
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,813
A good amount.

87
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,774
But you don't feel
like you know them yet, right?

88
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,568
Not at all.

89
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,278
-Are you interested in one right now?
-Right now?

90
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,572
Yeah, right now.

91
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,741
-She's got someone.
-I do.

92
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:43,909
Tell me!

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,203
Tell me!

94
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,624
-Tell me.
-I thought you'd have guessed by now.

95
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,585
-I have no idea.
-No way.

96
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,252
Is it Yuuki?

97
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,213
-Is it?
-You're laughing.

98
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,339
Yeah, it is.

99
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,094
I can tell by your face.
It's definitely not Arman.

100
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,556
-She and Arman are friends.
-Yeah, Arman's too close to me.

101
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,933
But they've only gone out once?

102
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,896
Hikaru seemed to like me
in the beginning, too.

103
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,525
But in the end, I was rejected.

104
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,068
I'm scared that'll happen again.

105
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,199
When you're into someone,
do you change into someone you don't like?

106
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,785
-Like overthinking things?
-Yeah, and...

107
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,830
I became infatuated. Lovesick.

108
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:31,957
Yeah, it's bad.

109
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,628
I haven't heard too much about Riko,
so I wanna hear about her.

110
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,047
Do you like someone?

111
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,967
I don't like anyone...

112
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,677
but I am interested in someone.

113
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,516
Do you know who it is?

114
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,976
If I can ask you back.

115
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,937
I do, but...

116
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,066
I do, but...

117
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,279
I do.

118
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,115
-Then, yes, it's that person.
-Ah, that person.

119
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,913
-Are things going well for you two?
-I'm not sure.

120
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,041
I can't tell.

121
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,086
I wonder.

122
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,714
I wonder.

123
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,885
I can't tell what he's thinking right now.

124
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,433
-Oh, Hayato.
-I'm home.

125
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,143
-Welcome back.
-You're back early.

126
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,477
I got off early today.

127
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,522
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

128
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,066
Did I interrupt your conversation?

129
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,860
-You're awfully quiet.
-Not at all.

130
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,613
-It's okay?
-We were talking till now.

131
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,240
-Welcome back.
-Did you just get back?

132
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,579
Everyone's coming back.

133
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,665
What are you doing tomorrow, Martha?

134
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,418
My mom's leaving tomorrow,
so I'll see her one last time.

135
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,421
-What about in the evening?
-The evening?

136
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,798
I don't have plans for the evening.

137
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,717
-You'll be home?
-Yeah.

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,010
-Want to do the cooking lesson tomorrow?
-Can we?

139
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,596
-Is tomorrow okay?
-Yeah.

140
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,639
-The earlier the better, right?
-Yeah.

141
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:13,517
-A welcome party?
-No, she asked that I teach her to cook.

142
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,477
-Yeah.
-So I told her I would.

143
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,312
-That's why you bought the stuff?
-Yeah.

144
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,523
-You guys are cooking?
-Yeah.

145
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,108
What are you gonna cook?

146
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,360
I think we'll make a summer pasta.

147
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,904
-A summer pasta?
-Sounds nice!

148
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,948
-Sounds cool.
-Yeah.

149
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,950
-A summer pasta.
-A summer pasta.

150
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,036
-An easy summer pasta.
-An easy summer pasta.

Pasta...

158
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,544
Do you make this pasta at the restaurant?

159
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,379
No. I came up with this dish yesterday.

160
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:29,301
-I'm so excited.
-Yeah, it's already completed in my mind.

161
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,054
This much.

162
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,973
You cut it like that? In thirds?

163
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,018
-Like this?
-Nice. You know how to use a knife.

164
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,021
-Nice.
-Is it?

165
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,899
This part's important.

166
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,693
-What?
-This part's important.

167
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,445
Add the wasabi and dashi soy sauce.

168
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,238
Only a dash of soy sauce.

169
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,491
Like that.

170
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,788
A little wasabi.
It pulls the flavors together.

171
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,749
It's hot.

172
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,797
-It's ready?
-Yeah.

173
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:15,222
-You cool it?
-Yeah, and then you toss.

174
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,351
Looks so delicious.

175
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,645
Done!

176
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,065
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

177
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,068
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

178
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,951
It's so good!

179
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,370
I'm glad.

180
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,913
Seriously, thanks.

181
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:44,042
-You can make it now, right?
-I probably can. Probably.

182
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:48,881
You got the ingredients yesterday?
You thought of it and bought everything?

183
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,508
You're so sweet.

184
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,010
Thank you.

185
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,554
-You mentioned working in child care.
-Yeah.

186
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,847
What was that about?

187
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,141
I study it when I have time.

188
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,893
Is that what you'd like to do?

189
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,688
I've wanted to
from around the time I was in sixth grade.

190
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,357
So that's where you want to end up?

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,278
I do, but now I'm interested
in my job, too, of course.

192
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,949
But I know I can't model forever.

193
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,828
Whenever my motivation drops,
I think of childcare.

194
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,413
I understand how you feel.

195
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,373
-You do?
-I do.

196
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,252
-Were you always a chef?
-No, I used to act...

197
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,004
but I gave it up.

198
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,883
It's easy to dabble in acting...

199
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,053
and to say that's what I'm working toward.

200
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,722
But I had decided my cut off was 30,
so I stopped...

201
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,141
and moved on to the next thing.

202
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,813
-You're 24 or 23, right?
-I'm 22.

203
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,523
Oh, 22.

204
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,274
That's way older.

205
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,401
You're still young, so it's fine.

206
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,404
But it might seem like
you're not committed.

207
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:59,201
To say you model now,
but that you want to be in childcare, too.

208
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,704
I was like that, so I do understand.

209
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,873
I understand, I'll...

210
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,835
try to give it more thought.

211
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,089
I just creeped myself out.
I was so serious.

212
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,883
-Why don't you pour yourself a drink?
-Good idea.

213
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,927
Break time.

214
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,637
Yeah, take a break.

215
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,684
Let's talk about dating.

216
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,519
Dating? Okay.

217
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,688
We've been talking about goals too much.

218
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,898
How is it?

219
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,235
It's fine.

220
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,903
-What?
-It's fine.

221
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,740
What is?
You've gone out several times, right?

222
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,868
I'm not sure
they could be considered dates.

223
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,786
You mean from your viewpoint?

224
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,248
I really like her as a person.

225
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,628
But she's like a younger sister.

226
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,422
-I'm not sure.
-You don't see her as a woman yet?

227
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,509
Maybe I don't see her as a woman yet.

228
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,137
-So there's no progress yet?
-Yeah, it's a little...

229
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,889
It's on hold right now?

230
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,057
Nothing's ended or started either.

231
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,518
It's in a suspended state.

232
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:16,028
-Thank you.
-It's so quiet.

233
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,321
No one's home yet.

234
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,783
-Yeah, that's true.
-Yeah, they're not home yet.

235
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,663
You want to just stick our feet in?

236
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,540
Just our feet?

237
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,082
I'm wearing pants.

238
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:31,794
You got it.

239
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,839
-It's cold!
-Feels like summer.

240
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,340
I also wanna light fireworks.

241
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,552
-We've got fireworks.
-Seriously?

242
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,386
Yeah, rocket fireworks.

243
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,472
This is pretty cold!

244
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,019
It feels nice.

245
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,273
There it is.

246
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,528
You went for the classic move.

247
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,325
-What kind of guys have you dated?
-All kinds.

248
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,663
But none of them would clearly say...

249
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,249
that something bothered them.

250
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,794
It's kind of...

251
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,128
It makes you spoiled?

252
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,381
Most of them would never
be direct with me,

253
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,926
even though it would've been better
if they had.

254
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,012
Like what you said about my goals earlier.

255
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,808
I'm not used to having guys
tell me things like that, like...

256
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:32,104
-Like, "That part doesn't work"?
-Yeah, because apparently I seem stubborn.

257
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,649
-Maybe they can't express themselves.
-Yeah, it usually just ends with, "I see."

258
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,569
Apart from my agent,
you're the first person to be so direct.

259
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,240
-No way! I'm sorry. Are you all right?
-No, I'm actually grateful.

260
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,659
Seriously.

261
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,661
Work hard toward becoming
a childcare worker.

262
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,538
-Focus on your studies.
-Yeah, I want to.

263
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,331
I should work harder.

264
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,709
-You haven't been studying lately?
-I haven't been.

265
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,669
-You've been slacking?
-I have.

266
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,549
They're living up the summer.

267
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,467
I just heard a phrase
I've never heard before.

268
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,553
-Oh, what old man Tokui said?
-Yes.

269
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,472
Water splashing is summer's foreplay.

270
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:08,641
Thank you for that.

271
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:12,435
You're an expert
at incorporating innuendo to everything.

272
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,230
-He is, isn't he?
-An expert.

273
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,107
-It's a skill.
-It is.

274
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,234
I'll add it to my résumé.

275
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:25,198
But when the girls were talking
and Hayato came home,

276
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:29,912
he kind of made the first move.
That was kind of cool, wasn't it?

277
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,330
-I really didn't like it though.
-Why?

278
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,709
-Because if I were Rikopin...
-If you were Rikopin, you mean.

279
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,753
I'd rather he ask in my absence.

280
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,924
But she already said she'd only go so far
since they're not together.

281
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,968
She's already put up a wall.

282
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,179
-So she has no right to say--
-But...

283
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,597
-It's painful.
-Painful?

284
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,183
-From Rikopin's point of view.
-What's going on?

285
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,602
He's his usual self.

286
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:56,501
Seriously.

287
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:02,528
It's a tough call.
It depends on whether a cooking lesson...

288
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,573
How can I put it?
It's not quite a date.

289
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,115
That's true.

290
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,120
It also depends on whether he realizes
she's coming on to him.

291
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,999
Even I'd realize she was coming on to me.

292
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,501
Maybe he's more clueless than me.

293
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,587
When Martha...

294
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,673
says she's glad he commented
about her goals...

295
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:28,804
even when she says she's really happy,
it seems like an effort to cater to him.

296
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,601
-It'll make him like her more.
-I see.

297
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:37,605
-So it didn't really make her that happy?
-No, I'm sure it did, but...

298
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,814
You really...

299
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,860
-You're in trouble. Keep calm.
-She's angry.

300
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,864
Your level of comprehension
is too extreme.

301
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:51,660
She's showing her female wiles,
acting like she's happy when she's not.

302
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,245
It's not that.

303
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,581
It's like when you have
sansho pepper leaves.

304
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:59,835
They're aromatic to start with,
but if you smash them...

305
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,754
-Brilliant.
-So stylish.

306
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,632
-That was so stylish.
-It was a stylish simile, wasn't it?

307
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,135
That's on the test
when you graduate comedy school.

308
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,095
-No, it's not.
-Definitely not.

309
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,056
-Not at all.
-Impossible.

310
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,852
Man, am I so obtuse that you guys
have to come up with these similes?

311
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,358
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

312
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,653
You're washing dishes?

313
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,238
I saw they piled up, so...

314
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,492
-Want a smoothie?
-Yeah, I'd like one.

315
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,495
-Milk or soy milk?
-Soy.

316
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,790
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

317
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,251
-Want a smoothie?
-Yeah.

318
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,878
-Ready?
-Okay.

319
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,881
I'm sure it'll be good.

320
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,760
-Do you think it's ready?
-What do you think?

321
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,264
-How is it?
-I'm going to pour.

322
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,266
-Is it okay? Thank you.
-It's okay.

323
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,810
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

324
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,270
-You got some on you.
-It's good!

325
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,690
It's good.

326
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:06,026
-Morning.
-Arman, you're up late.

327
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,195
-Arman, I made some smoothies.
-Seriously?

328
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,239
-Can I have some?
-Sure.

329
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,616
How is it?

330
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,536
-It's good.
-No way!

331
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,662
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

332
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,581
My stomach's starting to rumble.

333
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,542
-That's quick.
-Yeah.

334
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,087
-It always works quickly on me.
-You should drink a smoothie every day.

335
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,006
I've got a fast metabolism.

336
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,592
Thanks for the smoothie.

337
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,010
Of course. You're welcome.

338
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,849
I'll wash up.

339
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:41,019
-How unusual.
-I think my stomach's rumbling, too.

340
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,939
Oh no, what should I do?

341
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,482
I'm going to the restroom.

342
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,068
Just leave it here.

343
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,112
I need to use the restroom.

344
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,699
My stomach hurts.

345
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,579
When are you going out with Hayato again?

346
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:03,709
I want to,
but I'm still considering things.

347
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,004
-It's a secret.
-Okay.

348
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,006
-Don't tell.
-I won't.

349
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,384
-Okay.
-What about you? Going to the beach?

350
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,261
I don't know if it'll be the beach, but...

351
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,890
-Have you decided on a date?
-Not at all.

352
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,142
-Thanks, Arman.
-Sure.

353
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,393
Thank you.

354
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,979
I'm gonna go get ready.

355
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,356
-See you.
-Yeah. Thanks again.

356
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,440
Me...

357
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:30,778
I'm going back to sleep.

358
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,531
-You're going to sleep?
-I'm going to sleep.

359
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,159
-She's gone.
-Yeah, to sleep.

360
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:44,041
-Did you learn how to make the dish?
-The dish? Yeah, sort of.

361
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,961
I didn't really do much.

362
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,089
He cooked while he was teaching me.

363
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,966
Did you have fun?

364
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,635
I did have fun.

365
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,304
It was fun.

366
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,265
I see...

367
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,730
But the relationship talk
didn't go very far.

368
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:11,193
-No?
-Yeah, I tried asking about you.

369
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:17,157
But I don't think he really knows himself.

370
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,326
-Hayato?
-Yeah.

371
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,330
Not that he doesn't know his feelings,
but...

372
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,749
You're much...

373
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,376
-younger than him.
-Significantly.

374
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,921
But he did say that doesn't bother him.

375
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,718
I don't really know how he feels.

376
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,428
He really didn't say much. Seriously.

377
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,849
You're not going to ask him out?

378
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,976
Yeah.

379
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,357
I'd like to go out somewhere with him.

380
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,026
-You're going to ask?
-Yeah.

381
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,788
My stomach's rumbling, too.

382
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,456
-The restroom?
-The restroom.

383
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,291
Everybody else already went.

384
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,544
It wasn't available earlier.

385
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,256
-Later.
-Yeah.

386
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,642
MINAMI-AOYAMA, TOKYO

387
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,645
A-LIGHT

388
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:30,627
A-LIGHT CORPORATION

389
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:35,152
Thank you for coming out from Nagoya.

390
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,112
-It's a long way.
-Not at all.

391
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,614
MISAWO NAGAI
RIKO'S MOTHER

392
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,866
I'm sure you have worries being so far,

393
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:46,454
but we're hoping you'll place your trust
in us and assuage your worries.

394
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,374
YUJI MATSUO - MARIKO KONYA

395
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,251
And mom can sign as the guardian.

396
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:59,051
This contract will take effect
immediately.

397
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,345
-We look forward to working with you.
-Yes, I'll work hard.

398
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,681
-Yes.
-Thank you.

399
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,307
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

400
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,144
OMOTESANDO, TOKYO

401
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,647
Finally. Are you relieved?

402
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,858
I am, but this is just the beginning.

403
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,026
That's true.

404
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,989
There's so much going on
at <i>Terrace House.</i>

405
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,118
I thought that after one or two months,

406
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,246
you'd say, "Mom, I want to go home."

407
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,749
-You thought I'd say that?
-I did.

408
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,252
Is anything bothering you?

409
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,047
Um... Hayato?

410
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,717
You saw that?

411
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,260
-You saw it on Netflix?
-I did.

412
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:47,432
As my mom, how does it make you feel?

413
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,852
How do I feel?

414
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,645
It does feel a little weird.

415
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:58,861
I didn't think you'd be interested
in someone so much older.

416
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,696
I was surprised.

417
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,405
-Really?
-Yeah.

418
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,200
But I have fun with him.

419
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:09,747
He's asked me out on three dates.

420
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,376
So I thought this time
I should maybe ask him

421
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,546
because he's stopped asking me.

422
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,048
He's stopped talking about it.

423
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,009
Where do you want to go?

424
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,762
Like a festival around here.

425
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,305
-Is there one in the summer?
-Like a fireworks show.

426
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,057
That's nice. You can wear a yukata.

427
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,769
-A yukata?
-You can wear a yukata

428
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,896
-and go see fireworks.
-In a yukata.

429
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,692
I should ask.

430
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,361
If you're still unsure...

431
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,488
the fireworks will end before you decide.

432
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,407
-Summer's going to end soon.
-That's true.

433
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,992
What should I do?

434
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,621
Yuuki's not home yet?

435
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,415
I wonder how it went.

436
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,793
We're all wondering.

437
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,628
Do you think he passed or failed?

438
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,129
-I'm sure he passed.
-Yeah.

439
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,881
He was studying for it yesterday.

440
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:04,134
-He studied for it last time too.
-Did he?

441
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,096
-Welcome back.
-Oh, you weren't home yet.

442
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,472
Sorry for interrupting.

443
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,435
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

444
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,856
-You came together?
-We did.

445
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,942
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

446
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,234
It's nice to meet you.

447
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,278
-Please...
-Come sit down.

448
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,990
Rikopin's mom,
would you like something to drink?

449
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,953
-I can make whatever you like.
-What do I want?

450
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,622
-Tea, water, a highball, anything.
-I'll have tea please.

451
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:37,334
Tea, water, or a highball?
Why a highball?

452
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,588
-Do we still have tea?
-We may be out of tea.

453
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,089
Water is okay then.

454
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,592
-Are you doing well?
-I am.

455
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,219
It's so spacious.

456
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,679
Amazing.

457
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,849
-It feels strange.
-It does!

458
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,308
Here you go.

459
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,603
Oh, thank you.

460
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:58,355
-Arman.
-Arman's working.

461
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,610
This is the first time, right?

462
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,028
We just signed with the talent agency.

463
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,197
-So it's been decided?
-Yeah.

464
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,533
And then we went out for dinner.

465
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,785
And I decided to bring her here.

466
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,954
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

467
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,413
Thank you.

468
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,250
It's great that you got an agent.

469
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,586
You must have been worried.

470
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:26,216
She's talked about everyone here a lot,
how you're all such good people.

471
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,052
There's no need to worry.

472
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,223
-He's back.
-Who?

473
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,267
-Welcome back.
-Welcome home.

474
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,769
Hayachan.

475
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:41,899
I'm home.

476
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,484
-You knew it was my mom?
-Of course.

477
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,111
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

478
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,195
I'm Hayato.

479
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,908
You caught me by surprise.

480
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,450
What is this?

481
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,165
-Are you drinking something?
-Yes, water.

482
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,708
Oh, water.

483
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:03,754
Oh, right. Riko got an agent.

484
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,966
-My mom came to sign with the agency.
-Congratulations.

485
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,928
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

486
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,683
I can't keep staring at him.

487
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:18,268
-Maybe you should drink something.
-No, no...

488
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,187
-You're acting strange.
-Do you need a drink?

489
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,271
She's not herself yet.

490
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,650
-Why are you pressuring her?
-We've talked on the phone before.

491
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,151
Yes.

492
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,485
On Riko's phone.

493
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,281
We were both drunk.

494
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,283
She always calls when she's drunk.

495
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,993
Are you okay?

496
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:38,080
-It's like, "Mom..."
-Yeah, "let's drink in Nagoya."

497
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:40,916
They're phone buddies.

498
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,464
I'm nervous.

499
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,759
Your face is red.

500
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,220
I'm hot. You're sitting so close.

501
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,347
She's too close?

502
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,392
-Too close?
-She's relieved.

503
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,604
-Where's Yuuki?
-He's not home yet.

504
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,647
We're waiting to hear his results.

505
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,442
That's right! So no one knows yet?

506
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,402
-No, we don't.
-Tell him.

507
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,154
I'm not gonna speak to him
if he doesn't pass.

508
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,533
That's scary. Your expression's scary.

509
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:21,915
If Yuuki is getting back late,
I'd like to show my mom the girls' room.

510
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,834
Sure. Do you want to go now?

511
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,216
-It's a little messy.
-It's so spacious.

512
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,968
Can you tell which bed is mine?

513
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,302
That one.

514
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,889
-Are all my Hello Kitty things creepy?
-It's cute.

515
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,183
What did you think of the mens?

516
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,645
-"The mens"?
-The mens.

517
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,855
They were...

518
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,025
better looking than I expected.

519
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,945
-Better than what you see on TV?
-Which one? Hayato or Arman?

520
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,072
-Both.
-Oh, both.

521
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,949
Better than I expected.

522
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,536
I've heard a lot about Hayato
from Riko though.

523
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,496
I know they've gone out on dates.

524
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,415
So I was studying him.

525
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:06,168
But he seems like a good boy.

526
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,588
Easy to talk to.

527
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:13,634
-It seemed like he tried to be friendly.
-Yes.

528
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,596
So even when it comes to Riko,

529
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,765
he seems to be very caring.

530
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:24,186
That's the impression I had.

531
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,814
He seems very nice.

532
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,941
-They've been up there for a while.
-Yeah.

533
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,901
I'm sure it's a lot of girl talk.

534
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,945
-Girl talk with the four of them.
-Definitely.

535
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,613
-Hey, Yuuki.
-Hey, Yuuki.

536
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:37,324
-Hey.
-Welcome back.

537
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,493
-You're back late.
-Yeah, sorry about that.

538
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:43,747
-What is it?
-What?

539
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,791
-Oh, no. This is a bad vibe.
-Oh, no...

540
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,085
Did it not go well?

541
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,589
-This is between us.
-Sure, sure.

542
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,175
I passed.

543
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,344
-That's great.
-What's with this vibe then?

544
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,012
You scared me.

545
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:03,016
But I didn't want to tell Misaki yet.

546
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,562
But she knows you took the test today.
She's been really anxious.

547
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,022
I wanted to surprise her.

548
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,609
If you can, keep it between us for now.

549
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,736
-Of course.
-Keep it quiet.

550
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,530
Oh, Yuuki, there's a new member.

551
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:18,574
Welcome back.

552
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,827
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

553
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,746
It's my mom!

554
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,414
Oh, seriously?

555
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,375
Finally, a reaction.

556
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,753
-Oh, nice to meet you.
-You couldn't tell?

557
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:33,213
-I was so surprised. Nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

558
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:37,467
-I'm Yuuki Byrnes. Nice to meet you.
-I'm Mrs. Nagai.

559
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,886
-She's leaving.
-It's late.

560
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,846
-I'll be going.
-We'll walk you out.

561
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,348
Be careful. Good night.

562
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,559
-Please take care of Riko.
-Hey, we should all see her out.

563
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,271
-Bye. I'm going to take her back.
-Okay.

564
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,899
Click.

565
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,359
That was such a surprise.

566
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,903
When'd you get back, Yuuki?

567
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,696
More importantly...

568
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,991
-What?
-How'd it go?

569
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,119
-How'd what go?
-What?

570
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,872
-We've all been worried.
-What do you mean?

571
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,957
Didn't you take your test today?

572
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,835
I did. I did.

573
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,005
And?

574
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,133
Well, that...

575
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:20,761
What?

576
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,596
-Did you pass?
-I'll tell you...

577
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,891
-next time.
-What?

578
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,902
-That's fine. Good work.
-Good work.

579
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,445
Cheers.

580
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,115
I'm going to sleep.

581
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,627
Why'd she leave?

582
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,504
She's been waiting up.

583
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:58,799
That was a mistake on your part.

584
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,676
Yeah.

585
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,261
If we didn't know
when you were getting your results,

586
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,723
and you told us you already know,
that's understandable.

587
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,100
But we all knew you'd find out today.

588
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,854
-You knew I'd get results today.
-Yeah.

589
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:14,168
For you to know and not say...

590
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,899
I see what you're saying.

591
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:21,029
-It doesn't really work as a surprise.
-Now that you say it, it makes sense.

592
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:41,592
Hey.

593
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:42,968
Hey.

594
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,429
-Tired?
-Hmm?

595
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,431
-Are you sleepy?
-Yeah.

596
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,191
I really didn't like the way you acted.

597
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,486
Yeah.

598
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,572
It made me think you failed.

599
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,953
Because it was you...

600
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:14,249
there was a part of me
that wanted to surprise you.

601
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,337
I passed.

602
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:26,386
I thought that for our next date...

603
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,764
I'd come pick you up or something.

604
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:33,435
I came up with all these ways
to surprise you.

605
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:39,316
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

606
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,196
-I'm happy for you.
-Yes, I passed.

607
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,908
Are you free on Friday?

608
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,160
Friday? I am.

609
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,162
Let's go somewhere.

610
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,998
I'll drive.

611
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,292
-Let's go downstairs.
-Let's go.

612
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:01,129
-Back to the others.
-Thanks for coming for me.

613
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,381
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

614
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:10,097
They get along so well!

615
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,559
-That scene was too chummy.
-So stupid.

616
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:16,645
It was nice, the whole,
"Let's go back to everyone!"

617
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:20,148
So she was just sulking.

618
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,442
But they're both so frank.

619
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:27,531
He apologized
and she said, "I'm happy for you."

620
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:29,449
-It's so cute!
-So cute!

621
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,869
He was so bad at surprising her.

622
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,997
Everyone knew he'd know the results.

623
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,415
But he can't say?

624
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:40,127
-Terrible.
-It's cute!

625
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,880
And Arman says, "Good work."

626
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,048
It's like, good work on what?

627
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,676
Why are all the guys
with chiseled features stupid?

628
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,389
It's only a matter of time
between Byrnes and Misaki.

629
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,224
I'm glad for them.

630
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:58,521
-It's been a while since we had a couple.
-That's true!

631
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:00,939
Not since the meat incident.

632
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,066
-The meat?
-That's right, the meat thing.

633
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,693
Uchi and Minori.

634
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,945
The other day, Eiichiro Oda sent me
a message on LINE

635
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:10,323
asking whether Minori and Uchi
are still together.

636
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,117
-Wow.
-You talk on LINE with him?

637
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,536
Yeah, I do.

638
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,704
-The guy who wrote <i>One Piece?</i> Wow.
-That's right.

639
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:17,330
He's a huge fan of <i>Terrace House.</i>

640
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,207
-Really?
-That's amazing.

641
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,293
-He watches every episode on Netflix.
-Seriously?

642
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,295
He sends me his thoughts
in the middle of the night.

643
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:27,465
He's into Terashima right now.

644
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,301
For real?

645
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,970
-As expected.
-As he should be.

646
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:35,390
We now have a cupid in Riko's mom.

647
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:38,143
She's creating pressure for Masako.

648
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:41,980
There's Terashima,
who's not certain how he feels,

649
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:43,273
and Riko who's hesitant.

650
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:46,359
But the mom might just come
and push them together.

651
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,612
-That's possible.
-Yes.

652
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:54,743
Martha and Riko have scary expressions
when they look at each other.

653
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,162
-That morning--
-Sparks?

654
00:33:57,245 --> 00:34:00,040
-After the smoothie.
-There was a weird vibe.

655
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,334
The effect the smoothies had
on their bowels,

656
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,169
-wasn't that amazingly quick?
-It was amazing.

657
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,046
They were all pooping.

658
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:11,134
How about how things were
between Riko and Martha?

659
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,637
What was that? Was she mad?

660
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:16,515
It was a little tense.

661
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,894
Riko was like a student
after a private meeting with the teacher.

662
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,689
"I think my stomach is rumbling, so...

663
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,649
I'm going to go now."

664
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:29,069
Things are starting to get
a little sticky.

665
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:32,072
NAKAMEGURO, TOKYO

666
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,077
Where are you going for your drive?

667
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,121
I'm seriously considering...

668
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,503
taking her to Yokohama.

669
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:46,587
-Yokohama?
-Yes.

670
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,671
NOBUYA HISATOMI

671
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,132
Yokohama's streets
are pretty difficult to navigate.

672
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,967
Might be tough for a beginner.

673
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,263
But Yokohama...

674
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:02,352
is where Misaki's been rejected
once before.

675
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,897
-By another guy?
-Yes.

676
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,857
I was rejected there too, long ago.

677
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,903
-By a woman from Yokohama.
-In Yokohama?

678
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:16,491
Everybody tells me
I shouldn't go there because of that.

679
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,119
-But it doesn't matter, does it?
-No.

680
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,913
Right?

681
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,582
It's a nice town.

682
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:29,046
Not to be stubborn or anything,
but I have confidence in the city.

683
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,423
I know I can show her a good time there.

684
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:36,887
I was going to tell her how I feel there.

685
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,807
What? You haven't already?

686
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,600
-Not yet.
-I see.

687
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:43,852
You think it'll go well?

688
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:47,022
-Depends on the date?
-I've got no idea.

689
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,956
<i>-The sound of the waves is nice.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

690
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,916
<i>It's calming.</i>

691
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,376
<i>Look, they're kissing.</i>

692
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,003
<i>Guess it's that kind of place.</i>

693
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,605
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

694
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,899
-Where are you going?
-I don't know.

695
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:33,694
-You haven't heard?
-Is he trying to surprise you again?

696
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,488
Is he?

697
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:38,448
Is he trying to surprise you again?

698
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:42,285
The surprises haven't gone well so far.

699
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,913
He hasn't told you even though you asked?

700
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:46,331
-I haven't asked.
-Oh, you haven't?

701
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,000
Isn't it...

702
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,169
-more fun if I don't ask?
-I suppose.

703
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,382
<i>I like you.</i>

704
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,723
<i>I'd like to go out with you.</i>

705
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,142
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

706
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:11,085
<i>I feel like you don't know yourself.</i>

707
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:13,066
<i>You're insecure.</i>

708
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,029
<i>And it's those core elements to you</i>
<i>which I don't really like.</i>

709
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,158
<i>But I don't like you like that.</i>

710
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,619
<i>So, I can't go out with you.</i>
