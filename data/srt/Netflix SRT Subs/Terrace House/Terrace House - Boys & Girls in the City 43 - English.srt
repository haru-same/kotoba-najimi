00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,889
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,642
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,226
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,146
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,899
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,901
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,194
{\an8}KENTARO FUJIMURA NOT PRESENT
DUE TO A FILM SHOOT.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:32,741
So last week, Masako invites Hayato
out and they go to lunch.

9
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:37,287
Where he tells her the two of them
should not hang out alone anymore.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,707
{\an8}Maybe we shouldn't go out
alone together anymore.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,042
{\an8}Us, you mean? Sure.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,127
{\an8}-I'm sorry.
-No.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,129
{\an8}<i>Masako's giving up.</i>

14
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,923
{\an8}<i>-For Riko...</i>
<i>-He put an early stop to it.</i>

15
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,217
{\an8}She even tells Riko.

16
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,637
{\an8}-And then there was Arman's accident.
-There was that.

17
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,763
{\an8}I'm fine.

18
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,849
{\an8}No bones are broken.

19
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,559
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD

20
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,018
{\an8}I got four stitches.

21
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,519
{\an8}I'm so relieved, though.

22
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,063
{\an8}I'm sorry, Yuuki.

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,481
{\an8}YUUKI BYRNES, 23 YEARS OLD

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,566
{\an8}-Sorry.
-Sorry.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,486
{\an8}<i>Even though Byrnes</i>
<i>cares so much about Arman,</i>

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,449
he let's it slip that Masako
likes Terajima right in front of him.

27
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,203
You're crushing his heart now?

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:23,291
{\an8}But because of the accident,
Masako tends to Arman's wounds.

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,793
{\an8}MASAKO ENDO, 22 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD

30
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,211
{\an8}<i>-That's right.</i>
<i>-There was hope at the end.</i>

31
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,130
{\an8}-You have to go to the hospital tomorrow?
-Yeah.

32
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,674
{\an8}Get better quick so we could go somewhere.

33
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,134
{\an8}Yeah.

34
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,095
{\an8}So this week will be the yukata date.

35
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,055
-Will it be the yukata date?
-Yes, the yukata date.

36
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,141
<i>Will Hayato make a move?</i>

37
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:44,647
{\an8}<i>-He seems like he wouldn't though.</i>
<i>-That's true.</i>

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,066
{\an8}Will Riko be writing "coward"
on an omu-rice again?

{\an8}VIDEO OF UCHIHARA AND OMU-RICE

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,904
{\an8}-Brings back memories.
-Brings back memories!

41
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,072
{\an8}The omu-rice from hell.

42
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,659
-That did happen.
-Yes, it did.

43
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,952
The omu-rice did not look tasty.

44
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,079
It really didn't.

45
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,332
-I don't think we said anything like that.
-Yeah!

46
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,043
-It wasn't from hell either.
-Yeah!

47
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,878
-We applauded her for it.
-Yeah, it was cute.

48
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,962
Did we?

49
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,090
Yeah, your memories switched it
into something dark.

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,599
{\an8}KITASENJU, TOKYO

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,487
Oh, you bought one?

52
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,406
-A yukata?
-Yeah, I did.

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,490
It's nice.

54
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,284
-Shall we get going?
-Let's get going.

55
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,538
-It's good. It looks good.
-Really?

56
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,169
-Nice.
-Nice.

57
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,257
-There's so many people. Look.
-Wonder where they'll shoot the fireworks.

58
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,301
Over there, probably.

59
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,428
-Over there?
-Probably.

60
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,180
Maybe it'll be from here.

61
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,936
-It's nice along the river.
-Yeah.

62
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,316
Cute.

63
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,696
-He's so cute!
-He's cute.

64
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,658
He's so cute!

65
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,370
-Is it okay here?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,290
-Should we go all the way down?
-Here's good.

67
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,167
Oh, man, the wind...

68
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,253
Hold this a second?

69
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,046
-Ready?
-Okay.

70
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,215
-Sit, sit.
-Okay.

71
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,430
It's soft.

72
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,937
So we're at a fireworks show.

73
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,355
We are.

74
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,691
I wanted to go.

75
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,988
-So you thought it'd be okay?
-Yeah.

76
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,531
-You've changed.
-Yeah.

77
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,615
You're an adult now?

78
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,659
-Yeah. I've grown.
-Yeah, you have.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,704
Now that we've come to a fireworks show...

80
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,419
have you thought about what
you want to happen with us?

81
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,256
Going forward.

82
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,759
I haven't thought about it.

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,471
But...

84
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,184
before this...

85
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:33,065
going to a fireworks show with a guy...

86
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,567
is something I wouldn't have done it.

87
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,027
-You've said that.
-Yeah.

88
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,447
That's good.

89
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,449
-Is it?
-It is.

90
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,037
-You don't need to overthink it.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,216
It's so pretty.

92
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,508
Nice.

93
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,053
Wow.

94
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,738
That was amazing.

95
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,362
-It was hard to see with the smoke.
-What?

96
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,447
-It was hard to see with the smoke.
-Yeah, it was.

97
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,532
Was that it?

98
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,575
Let's go.

99
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,660
Let's go.

100
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,663
-What's wrong?
-What?

101
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,747
What's wrong?

102
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,749
What do you mean?

{\an8}Welcome home.
You look so cute!

110
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,384
{\an8}Speaking of.

It's so cute.

-It's nice!
-It does look mature.

It's nice. I'm glad.

Really?

116
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,272
It's been a month.
How was the date?

117
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,568
-That's right. It's been a month.
-Yeah, about a month.

118
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,779
Well...

119
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,116
it felt...

120
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,826
steady.

121
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,370
The same as usual?

122
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,664
Yeah, nothing really different happened.

123
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,002
He didn't hold your hand?

124
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,419
He didn't.

125
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:47,175
I wonder why? Maybe because
I've already said I wouldn't.

126
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,263
Maybe he's trying to go along with me.

127
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:56,809
So if Hayato held your hand,
would you have liked it? Or no?

128
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,353
I didn't want him to.

129
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,317
I want to save things like that.

130
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,988
Especially because we've been
going out on dates.

131
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:13,076
I felt like I wanted to save that.

132
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,664
-So you like him?
-So she wants to take things slow.

133
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,542
So you do have feelings for him?

134
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,004
I see, so you just want
to take things slow.

135
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,422
Yeah.

136
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,881
What did you guys do?

137
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,967
Nothing.

138
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,429
It was the same as usual.

139
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,222
What?

140
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,226
But it was your first date in a while.
Weren't you guys excited?

141
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,228
Not really.

142
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,022
Wait, not even a kiss?

143
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,898
It's too fast for that.

144
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,859
-But you held hands with her?
-No.

145
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,696
-No? I see.
-You didn't go for it?

146
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,532
She invited me.

147
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,118
So I asked her whether she's been thinking
about what'll happen with us.

148
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,872
Like what she wants to happen
with me.

149
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,210
She said she hadn't really thought
about it.

150
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,672
-That's when you take the lead.
-Yeah, you're supposed to take the lead.

151
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,757
-You can't...
-You can't ask Riko that.

152
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,054
I mean she said she wouldn't do
yukata dates with a non-boyfriend,

153
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,597
but she went with you.

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,766
-She's sending signals.
-Yeah.

155
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,604
I didn't really feel like making a move,
to be honest.

156
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,482
So you're just going to
keep things like this?

157
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,611
You're just going to keep things
the way they are?

158
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,904
I won't be the one making the move.

159
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,118
So you can't see yourself with her?

160
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,661
I can't help but see her as a sister.

161
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,663
No attraction to her as a woman?

162
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't really feel that way about her.

163
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,837
Normally, you'd want sleep with her
or kiss her or something, right?

164
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,007
You feel that desire toward a woman.

165
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,301
I don't really feel that for her.

166
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,512
You should make that clear to her.

167
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,225
Right now, it just feels like
you're dragging it on.

168
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,650
I can't tell if Byrnes is stupid or smart.

169
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,153
What he said made sense.

170
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,904
Yes, he did make sense right there.

171
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,114
So...

172
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,034
Terashima doesn't see Rikopin as a woman.

173
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,246
-He's just not attracted to her.
-That's what it sounds like.

174
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,747
And Riko, too.

175
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,375
She doesn't want to hold hands.

176
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,585
She still doesn't want to.

177
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,546
-Then nothing's gonna happen.
-Yeah.

178
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,090
So neither of them
really like each other that much.

179
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,927
They're not really attracted
to each other.

180
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,011
What?

181
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,513
They just went to see fireworks
because it's summer.

182
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,639
What?

183
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,642
So we just watched
the daily life of roommates?

184
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,896
I feel like...
as if she is a virgin slut.

185
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,608
What should we do?

186
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,445
A virgin slut?

187
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,947
So Martha didn't need to give up.

188
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,241
Martha is probably just not his type.

189
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,076
Yeah, that's probably the case.

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,995
How can you reveal such a thing?

191
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,665
That's what it is, right?

192
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,250
-I--
-I'm so shocked.

193
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,003
I thought about saying that last week
but I held back.

194
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,049
Toward the beginning of the fireworks,

195
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,345
-Hayato asked about their future.
-Yeah.

196
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,348
-You ask because you're interested, right?
-Yeah, what was that about?

197
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,434
-I think he just asks out of habit.
-Why would you ask?

198
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,312
He can't help it.
He's someone who likes to confirm things.

199
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,397
He's too responsible.
"What are your plans going forward?"

200
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,442
Is this some kind of orientation?

201
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,736
Maybe both of them are just cautious...

202
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,072
-But the things he says--
-...about the way they feel.

203
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,618
His eyes were shining
when he saw Rikopin in her yukata.

204
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,411
His eyes just shine in general.

205
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,122
That's what it is!

206
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,959
At this rate, it'll take six years
for them to kiss.

207
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,046
-How many seasons will that take?
-Then yes, at this rate.

208
00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:00,970
Riko didn't want to hold hands that day.
She just wants to do things right.

209
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,933
So it's not like she doesn't have
feelings for Terashima.

210
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,895
-Yes, she just wants to go slow.
-She wants to treasure it.

211
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,730
Withdrawing and then pressing forward.

212
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,276
It's supposed to be something
that happens more impulsively.

213
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,819
You said that so well!

214
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:21,032
-I like it.
-They should be more impulsive!

215
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,617
That's how it should be!

216
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,662
I want her to say, "I'm not a child!"
with tears in her eyes.

217
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,831
To make a scene, you mean?

218
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,335
"I'm not a child!"
That's what I want.

219
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,753
You're doing it on your own.

220
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,257
You wanted it so much,
you just did it yourself.

221
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,593
Please, let it happen!

222
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,888
-Let it happen!
-Tokui gets possessed sometimes.

223
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,015
-That would be nice to see.
-Yeah.

224
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,477
{\an8}TAMACHI, TOKYO

225
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,480
SHIBAURA HORMONE

226
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,399
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

227
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,483
Cheers.

228
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,403
{\an8}How are things with you?
No complaints since getting together?

229
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
{\an8}None at all.

230
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,074
So things are pretty perfect?

231
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,493
Things haven't changed much.

232
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,746
From before you got together?

233
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,623
Everyone asks if we're sleeping together.

234
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,460
-Yeah, I was thinking that.
-I totally wanted to ask that.

235
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,378
Because I'm sure you want to.

236
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,964
I...
Well, I'm not sure.

237
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,758
It's not that I don't like him,
I love him.

238
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,636
But I feel like it's not the right time.

239
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,556
Have you told Yuuki that?

240
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,767
-I have.
-What did he say?

241
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,186
He agreed.

242
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,564
He's being patient for your sake.

243
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,317
But that's not what it's all about, right?

244
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,027
Being together, I mean.

245
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,738
It's not just about sleeping together.

246
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,864
That's true.

247
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,243
What about your part-time job, Martha?

248
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,203
-Me?
-Has it been decided?

249
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,416
I've been hired at the apparel shop.

250
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,917
But I haven't been able to go.

251
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,586
What about work in the industry?

252
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,755
I keep getting cut.

253
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,715
-From the auditions?
-Yeah.

254
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,385
It's the same for me, too.

255
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,177
I know that's just how it is.

256
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,431
I'm feeling concerned about it.

257
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,308
-That you're getting cut?
-Yeah, I keep getting cut.

258
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,062
My only work is with
the Muscats right now.

259
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm probably in the same boat.

260
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,819
If I'm home, it means I don't have work.

261
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,696
Yeah. I was thinking that, too.

262
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,408
-And we're all home pretty often.
-Yeah.

263
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,663
"He's working so hard, I should, too."
We don’t have anyone like that.

264
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,458
I think that's totally necessary.

265
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:40,004
I feel that way especially since
living at <i>Terrace House.</i>

266
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:46,386
There's less than a month left
for <i>Terrace House</i>.

267
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,596
You're right.

268
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,061
{\an8}GINZA, TOKYO

269
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,772
{\an8}I hardly ever come to Ginza.

270
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,315
{\an8}-Me neither.
-What?

271
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,987
-You're laughing too much.
-What?

272
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,742
-It's bathing suit time.
-Yeah.

273
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,411
Which pool should we go to?

274
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,662
Summerland?

275
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,124
-Yomiuriland.
-Should we be stylish and drink cocktails?

276
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,090
{\an8}SAN-AI MIZUKI RAKUEN

277
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,551
-I'm coming out.
-Okay.

278
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,389
-It looks really great!
-Don't come close.

279
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,475
Why?

280
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,934
-How is it?
-It's good.

281
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,644
It looks cute.

282
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,187
It looks really good on you.

283
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,271
Really?

284
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,193
I've never seen you show
so much skin.

285
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,946
Yeah. I'm only covered here and here.

286
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,824
Stop that.

287
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,408
Stop that.

288
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,411
I'm going to try the other one on.

289
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,039
-Yeah, I want to see it.
-The khaki one.

290
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,671
-This one's nice, too.
-Which one's better?

291
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,173
Which one's better do you think?

292
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,551
You're so cute. Now I'm nervous, too.

293
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,971
This makes me really nervous.

294
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,347
Which one do you like better?

295
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,431
Um...

296
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,184
Maybe this one.

297
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,645
-This one?
-Yeah.

298
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,397
Okay.

299
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,441
-Then I'm going to change.
-Okay.

300
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,488
Don't stare so much.

301
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,631
What did you think of our date?

302
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,133
At the fireworks?

303
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,469
At the fireworks?

304
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,263
It was fun, but...

305
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,100
It was just fun.

306
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,312
I was just wondering how you feel.

307
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,818
-How I feel?
-I've asked you before, but...

308
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,278
but if you're having fun, then...

309
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,073
I feel the same, too.

310
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,659
I think it's fine if we have fun.

311
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,243
-That's how you feel?
-Yeah.

312
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,371
It didn't feel like a lover's date.

313
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,126
You see me more as a sibling?

314
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,129
Yeah, I think so.

315
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,093
I want you to work on your career.

316
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,680
Yeah.

317
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,473
I do want to work hard on my career.

318
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,142
You have school, too.

319
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,980
I feel a little guilty.

320
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:52,529
I don't think you need to feel guilty.

321
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:58,535
I don't think you need
to worry about those things.

322
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:05,209
-You think about my work?
-Of course. I want you to do well.

323
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
I see.

324
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,133
Where did they go?

325
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,595
-You're going to go see?
-I'm going to go do laundry.

326
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:30,943
-Hey.
-Hey.

327
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,779
Are you going to use the laundry machine?

328
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:33,905
I don't know.

329
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,365
Laundry? No, I'm not.

330
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,742
What were you talking about?

331
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,576
I asked her what she thought of the date.

332
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,578
She said it was fun.

333
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,541
-That's all you said?
-So then...

334
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,212
I asked her what she wanted again.

335
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,050
She said as long as she has fun.

336
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,177
-Riko said that?
-Yeah.

337
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,721
So I said I had fun, too.

338
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,183
But that she feels like a sister to me.

339
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,271
If you can only see her as a sister,
then you can't see her as...

340
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,481
a girlfriend.

341
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,109
I didn't say that part.

342
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,194
Why?

343
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:17,865
I mean, she hasn't said
she feels that way about me.

344
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,201
Wouldn't it be presumptuous of me?

345
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,619
You have to say it.

346
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:27,792
Why do I have to say it so clearly,
when she hasn't said anything.

347
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,878
She had fun. I had fun.

348
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,421
I really think that...

349
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,217
Riko likes you.

350
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,804
We don't know that.
She hasn't said it.

351
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,555
I think Riko likes you.

352
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,099
You really can't see that?

353
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,854
That Riko likes you?

354
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,690
After all this?

355
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,192
You don't know, right?

356
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,568
Of course, you know.

357
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,738
How can you not know?

358
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,867
What? I just don't know.

359
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,829
She invited you on a yukata date.

360
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:10,001
A 19-year-old girl who said she wouldn't
invited you.

361
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,085
I know that.

362
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,880
That's why I went.

363
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,465
And then it's "that was fun"
and that's it?

364
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,843
That's what she's saying.

365
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,512
You say that it's because
it's what Riko says.

366
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,389
You're leaving it all up to her.

367
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,517
-That's not true.
-You need to step up and be a man.

368
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,853
Shut up.

369
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,647
It just looks like
you're playing around with her.

370
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,483
Whatever.

371
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,155
I feel...

372
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,324
really bad for Riko.

373
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,285
I think...

374
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,250
you should let her know early on.

375
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,044
I'll leave it to you.

376
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,596
-He's sulking.
-Yeah.

377
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,647
{\an8}EBISU, TOKYO

378
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,650
{\an8}HAMAJIRO

379
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,988
{\an8}-Let's sit in the back.
-Okay.

380
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,243
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

381
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,619
-It's so hot.
-What do you want to drink?

382
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,996
-A highball.
-Okay.

383
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,331
I'll have a draft beer.

384
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,834
Draft beer? Okay.

385
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,710
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

386
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,381
Delicious.

387
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,717
I wanted to thank you.

388
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,552
About?

389
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,805
Don't laugh.

390
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,517
I laughed because you laughed.

391
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,230
It's funny. So what was it?

392
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,443
When I got in the accident,
you looked after me. Thank you.

393
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,153
I'm glad you're better.

394
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,447
-It's healed a lot.
-Yeah, in about a week.

395
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,033
-It healed in a week?
-Yeah.

396
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,703
-We're home together so much.
-Yeah.

397
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,039
We're always at home together.

398
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,131
This heat feels like summer.

399
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:27,221
I invited you out today because
I wanted to get to know you better.

400
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,556
What do you know about me?

401
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,434
-By living together...
-We hang out together.

402
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,187
I'm starting to know your personality.

403
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,149
I didn't know you well at first,
but I've learned a lot recently.

404
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,402
It's fun hanging out with you.
I wonder why?

405
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,988
I feel comfortable with you.

406
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,949
That makes me happy.

407
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,493
How long have you been at <i>Terrace House?</i>

408
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,079
-Nine months, I think.
-Pretty long.

409
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,580
-I've been here awhile.
-Yeah.

410
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,875
Nine months.
That's almost a year.

411
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,087
You must be used to living
with everyone by now.

412
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,797
I am.

413
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,177
It's nice to meet people
but the goodbyes are hard.

414
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:14,185
Living here for almost a year,
I just came wanting to enjoy Japan.

415
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,395
And I'm really enjoying it.

416
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,023
But I should head home soon...

417
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,360
and start working.

418
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,405
You're going back to Hawaii?

419
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,783
-Well, I haven't decided when.
-So someday.

420
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,493
Someday.

421
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,204
It's been more fun recently.

422
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,372
Life at <i>Terrace House.</i>

423
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,790
-Recently?
-Yeah.

424
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,874
Why?

425
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,006
The train.

426
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
-Oh, excuse me.
-Oh? This is your second time.

427
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,524
-Good night.
-Stop that.

428
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,111
Misaki's bed.

429
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,244
It's dirty.

430
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,662
-What?
-The T-shirt.

431
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,085
What's wrong?

432
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,630
The way Hayato was acting yesterday.

433
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,424
I...

434
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,343
can barely stand it.

435
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,929
I'm the only one who saw it.

436
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,559
I've seen them acting lovey-dovey.

437
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,562
And I saw them kissing
in front of the elevator.

438
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,361
Knowing that,
I'm trying to tell Hayato what I think.

439
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:53,950
But Hayato is trying to hide it.

440
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,244
So...

441
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,454
-It's hard to see his true feelings.
-Yeah.

442
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:03,377
So what the two of them
are doing is just...

443
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,796
It's just so different.

444
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,756
It's all messed up.

445
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,135
I've noticed Riko missing before.

446
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:17,099
But when I ask the two of them
how they're feeling,

447
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:21,228
their answer is never what I expect.

448
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,646
Like, "Oh, I don't know."

449
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,233
And you want to say
of course you know.

450
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,984
And it makes you say things.

451
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,116
I wish I had said something
before things got confusing.

452
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,493
That's how I feel.

453
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:40,038
I knew what was going on earlier.
Well, it was last week.

454
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,500
Why are they so secretive about it?

455
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,628
Maybe because Riko is an idol.

456
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,089
Well...

457
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,841
-She's just starting.
-Yeah, she's just starting.

458
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,094
She has a lot of male fans...

459
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,681
who might not like her having a boyfriend.

460
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,643
I'm sure that's it.

461
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,062
So they're matching stories
behind the scenes...

462
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:08,359
and Hayato says he wants Riko to focus

463
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,321
on her studies and career.

464
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,948
That's what he's saying.

465
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,243
Shouldn't you tell him this in person?

466
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,788
I mean, he's kissing her even though
he's saying he doesn't want to.

467
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,127
Then he's not doing what he's saying.

468
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,628
Yeah, that's true.

469
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,591
If Riko seriously likes Hayato...

470
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,801
Then I feel bad for her.

471
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,096
Then Hayato is just playing Riko.

472
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,684
So I want him to be clear.

473
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,271
I'm not taking sides or anything.

474
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,735
Wait, do we need to see that again?

475
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,695
This is a huge problem!

476
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,864
-What?
-Wait, I'm kind of in a panic.

477
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:00,661
Yuuki witnessed Hayato and Riko kissing.

478
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,745
-What?
-What?

479
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,622
-Before the fireworks date.
-Yes.

480
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,457
Then what was all that
about holding hands?

481
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,043
What they're doing and saying
are totally different.

482
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,713
On the surface, he's acting
like he's not that interested.

483
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,759
Taking the stance that
he only sees her as a sister.

484
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,431
Byrnes just revealed
that it was all an act.

485
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,560
That's a huge bomb to drop.

486
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,728
This is a first for <i>Terrace House.</i>

487
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,731
I'm super shocked right now.

488
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,275
-It was shocking.
-It was a shock.

489
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,943
This is the first time...

490
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,821
None of us realized any of this.

491
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,408
It's embarrassing, we were played
by an 18 and 29-year-old.

492
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,952
That's true.

493
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:47,165
How can we get revenge?
How dare you damn kids play us?

494
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,544
This is really shocking.

495
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,506
You have to give it up to <i>Terrace House</i>
for telling it how it is.

496
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,925
This is entertainment, <i>Terrace House!</i>

497
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,387
-Amazing.
-They've done it.

498
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,766
But you know,
if the honest kids like Byrnes

499
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,312
were all doing something different
than what they're saying,

500
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,231
then what are we supposed to do?

501
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,359
Are we supposed to go along
with their act?

502
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,361
-That's right.
-Yes, that's true.

503
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,654
I was watching so intently.

504
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,449
We're really in a panic right now.

505
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,535
How can you act lovey-dovey
with the guy you like

506
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,454
without bringing your TV image down?

507
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,913
So you act lovey-dovey
when the camera's off.

508
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,501
And in front of the camera,
you act the best image of yourself.

509
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,294
That's what these two realized.

510
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,462
-That's what it is.
-Yes.

511
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,215
Then what was all that about going to
amusement parks only with a boyfriend?

512
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:42,095
So she was acting the part
of an innocent, shy girl on TV.

513
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,894
Shock.

514
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,898
It's the gap of what they're doing
and what they're trying to show on TV.

515
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,483
That gap is sneaky.

516
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,860
"So you don't mind if he held your hand?"

517
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,654
"No, I want to save that."

518
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,073
I was just remembering
how she said that so adamantly.

519
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,992
They don't have my support anymore.

520
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,955
I can't believe them anymore!

521
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,500
-This is crazy.
-It is crazy.

522
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,709
I can't believe them.

523
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:17,213
This is the biggest shocker
since <i>Terrace House</i> started.

524
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,008
-It's a major incident.
-Very major.

525
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,136
Wow, this is entertainment!

526
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,431
What's great is there's still video left.

527
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,848
And that thanks to this incident,

528
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,725
we've forgotten things
are going well for Arman.

529
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,771
-That's right! It looked good for Arman.
-We're sorry!

530
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,732
Except when the train
passed by the café.

531
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,693
He should've said, "Because I like you."

532
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,445
Yeah, the whole
"it's been more fun recently."

533
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,989
"Why?"
"Because you're here."

534
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,117
"What did you say?"

535
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,202
"Oh, nothing."

536
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,663
He had a chance for that kind of scene!

537
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,291
Instead he said, "There's a train."

538
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,876
-Very serious.
-Very serious.

539
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,796
It was his chance
for an unforgettable scene!

540
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,923
Is it a good thing then?
That she's comfortable with him?

541
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,426
Should guys take that as a chance
if a girl says that to them?

542
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,304
It could go either way.

543
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,639
It could mean she doesn't see him
as a man.

544
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,891
I won't go so far as to say that,

545
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,269
but often it's like,
"We're not like that."

546
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,482
Masako is vulnerable right now,
but in any case...

547
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,775
-putting that aside.
-Rather...

548
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,902
-We should listen to what they say.
-That's true.

549
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,614
I'm sure Prosecutor Byrnes
will be questioning them.

550
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,366
-Prosecutor Byrnes?
-Yes, Prosecutor Byrnes.

551
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,534
-Prosecutor Byrnes.
-No, no...

552
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,620
{\an8}It's not Kenji Moriwaki.

553
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,788
{\an8}KENJI MORIWAKI

554
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,290
He'll get to the bottom of things.

555
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,210
-We have to hear their thoughts.
-I can't believe them.

556
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,714
Going to Kagoshima for a shoot.
-Martha

557
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:46,011
{\an8}I'm kind of reaching my limit.

558
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,475
When he came back to our room
after the fireworks,

559
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,852
he said he can't see her as a woman.

560
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,021
That he can't hold hands with her
or kiss her.

561
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,023
-That's what he said.
-He did.

562
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,317
-He's totally doing all that.
-Yeah, all of it.

563
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,736
Yeah.

564
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,365
Knowing all this,

565
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,493
I can't really give advice
to Hayato anymore.

566
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,663
You mean how even though things
are progressing between them,

567
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,123
we have to pretend we don't know.

568
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,375
Yeah.

569
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,878
Making conversation
even though we know...

570
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,338
-It's not real.
-Yeah.

571
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:26,342
We should be clear about that.

572
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,511
It's just not fair.

573
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,683
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

574
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,309
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

575
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,602
Hey, Hayato.

576
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,646
I'm back.

577
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,355
Let's have a drink.

578
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,107
Sure.

579
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,192
I'm exhausted.

580
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,902
-Should I go get her?
-You don't seem tired.

581
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,077
It's been a while.

582
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,038
-What?
-Us drinking together.

583
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,668
It hasn't been that long.

584
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,211
-No way.
-It was the day before last.

585
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,796
-Was it?
-Yeah.

586
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,257
Good morning.

587
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,552
-Morning? Were you sleeping?
-Morning.

588
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,930
-Welcome back.
-I was taking a nap.

589
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,435
We sort of...

590
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,437
needed to talk to the two of you.

591
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,190
Which two?

592
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,859
You and Riko.

593
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,945
I wanted to talk to you.

594
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,115
Recently...

595
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,159
Well we talk, right?

596
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,205
About your dates and everything.

597
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,417
And I give advice.

598
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,881
But to be honest, what you're doing...

599
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,842
and what's being said is too different.

600
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,887
There's a gap.

601
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:59,561
You meet after the rest of us are asleep.

602
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:04,024
When I ran out of the elevator
the other day,

603
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,984
I saw you guys kissing.

604
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:13,366
When did you guys start sleeping together?

605
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:19,122
I noticed you disappearing
about a month ago.

606
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,334
When I'd wake up around 4:00 a.m.

607
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,882
sometimes Riko would be there.

608
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,098
What's the real reason you're doing this?
