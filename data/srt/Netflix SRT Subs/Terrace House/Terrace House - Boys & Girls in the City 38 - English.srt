1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,310
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,104
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,607
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,276
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,111
Last week...

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,490
The good-looking guy came.

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,283
Misaki and...

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,369
They seemed to be hitting it off
in Sangen-jaya,

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,537
being the same age and all.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,708
He's tending to Misaki's broken heart.
He says all the right things.

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,797
I want someone who can accept me as I am.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,799
There's no need for you to change at all.

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,509
The reason I was rejected...

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,094
He told me I had no core self.

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,346
You totally have a core self!

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,890
-They made plans for the next date.
-They did.

19
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:03,772
Byrnes promised to take her on a date
to Hakone once he gets his license.

20
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,192
Also, it's an important moment
in Momoka's life.

21
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,444
Whether you can become a pro or not

22
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,531
depends on how serious
you can devote yourself to ballet.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,325
If you don't have that kind of mindset,

24
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,622
I don't think you'll be able to become
a professional ballet dancer.

25
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,001
So do you have a goal
for this competition?

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,295
I need to make the top three.

27
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,671
Out of how many?

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,465
I think 150?

29
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,176
So her date with Arman was postponed.

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,971
-That's right.
-"Oh, really?" in his monotone voice.

31
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,931
"Yes, good luck" in his monotone voice.

32
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,725
And Rikopin...

33
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,727
Hayato's haunting her.

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,062
He's not haunting her.

35
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>They went to the Cupnoodles Museum.</i>

36
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,694
They did, but their conversation...

37
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,155
I don't want a date in yukatas.

38
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,281
Only for relationships?

39
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,951
If I'm not in a relationship with someone,
I wouldn't hold hands with him.

40
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,787
-You'd have to be in a relationship?
-I wouldn't hold hands otherwise.

41
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,291
That was the moment she built a wall.
It was cold of her.

42
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,170
Rikopin just expressed
her idea of a relationship.

43
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,923
No, that's just her way
of building a wall.

44
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,260
People who've got game don't understand.

45
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,262
-You think so?
-I know.

46
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,306
Girls do stuff like this.

47
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,517
-Are you naked from the waist down?
-My pants are pink!

48
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,812
-Sorry, I got nervous for a second.
-Me too.

49
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,148
I thought maybe you forgot your pants.

50
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,777
If that's the case,
you could've mentioned it before.

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,529
Torichan, it won't help if you squint.

52
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,532
-So true!
-Torichan!

53
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,285
-He does look pants-less.
-Don't turn around!

54
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,411
Torichan!

55
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,833
So we don't really know how she feels.

56
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,461
But when Rikopin came home,

57
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,047
-didn't she say she had fun?
-She did.

58
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,550
I realize I like hanging out with him.

59
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,677
-Oh, good.
-He takes the lead.

60
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,181
He gets excited with me about stuff.

61
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,810
Girls wouldn't say stuff like that
if they were interested.

62
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,561
I wonder...
But yeah, maybe.

63
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,938
So to Rikopin, you're a friend.

64
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,606
Probably.

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,026
-But Hayato thinks he was shut down?
-That's right.

66
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,903
I don't get why.

67
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,780
-That's true.
-Why not?

68
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,200
She said she could go on that date
even if she didn't like the person.

69
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,244
She said that to him
while they were there.

70
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,038
-So next time, they could wear yukatas--
-What?

71
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,375
Next time? After what she said?

72
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,419
Aren't you being a little too negative?

73
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,504
Aren't you being a little too positive?

74
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,884
But it's five against one.

75
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,886
I hate majority rule!

76
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,598
If we went by majority on this show,
my opinion would never count!

77
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,688
I talked to Hayato yesterday.

78
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,065
-You did?
-Yeah.

79
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,317
Can I ask about what?

80
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,237
Totally. In fact, it's better if you ask.

81
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,074
-Really?
-Yeah. Hayato thinks that...

82
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:06,079
you're trying to push him away.

83
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,751
Like, you don't want
to hold hands with him.

84
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,253
Things like that.

85
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,674
Because if someone you like
said something like that to you,

86
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:23,764
then you might think that
maybe they're not interested.

87
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,849
-Yeah...
-Yes.

88
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,478
So that's why he was acting that way.

89
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,149
-I see.
-You guys both like each other.

90
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,777
But if you put your feelings on hold,

91
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,156
what could happen won't happen.

92
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:45,118
It's been two years.
I've forgotten what dating's like.

93
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,789
Feels like I'm starting all over again
when it comes to dating.

94
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,917
Anyway, he thinks you're rejecting him.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,169
-I see.
-Yeah.

96
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,587
I see.

97
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,218
GAKUGEI UNIVERSITY, TOKYO

98
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,567
-Are you gonna be in a competition?
-A showcase, for an event.

99
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,153
Am I good enough to solo at the showcase?

100
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,030
-Solos are pretty difficult.
-It's my first time.

101

DAISAKU KIKUCHI
PROFESSIONAL DANCER

102
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,577
I'm feeling a lot of pressure right now.

103
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,414
It's on July 13th,
so I'll rehearse until then.

104
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,798
-Welcome home.
-I'm home.

105
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,343
-Did you work today?
-Yeah.

106
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,387
-It was busy.
-Welcome back.

107
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,810
-What's wrong?
-Um...

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,022
You...

109
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,442
were so quiet the other day.

110
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,030
It's been bothering me.

111
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,907
When we talked about relationships,

112
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,578
you said you wouldn't hold hands
if you weren't in one,

113
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,372
and there are places you wouldn't go to.

114
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,541
You drew a clear line.

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,294
I think that's what's great about you.

116
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,381
But the way you said it...
I felt shut down.

117
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,800
At least that's how I felt.

118
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,056
-It made me wonder what the point was.
-I see.

119
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,894
So did that make you consider...

120
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,356
not going on dates with me anymore?

121
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,942
It's fun, but...

122
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,947
Our... I'm not sure anymore.

123
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,079
What I said is how I really feel.

124
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,707
-But the way I said it...
-The way you said...

125
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,462
No! I meant I didn't communicate it well,

126
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,548
and maybe I gave you the wrong idea.

127
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:50,679
I wouldn't talk about stuff like that
with just anyone.

128
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:57,394
But maybe I gave you the idea
that I wasn't interested in you.

129
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,939
I hope not.

130
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,358
Because it's not true.

131
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,903
Okay.

132
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,740
Has that been bothering you?
I'm sorry...

133
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,825
Stop.

134
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,035
It's hard to... I mean...

135
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,163
I didn't think I was that quiet.

136
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,374
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

137
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,835
No, it wasn't like that.

138
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,046
I realized that I made you feel bad.

139
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,883
-But we do view relationships differently.
-Yeah.

140
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,844
But that's fine.

141
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,431
I think that you should be you.

142
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,932
Always.

Studying?

150
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,368
Studying.

151
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,999
Amazing.

152
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,669
Is it?

153
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,339
What's this congratulations letter for?

154
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,966
Oh, that was for my practice exam.

155
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,302
I'll give you a quiz.

156
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,514
Don't do it. No way.

157
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:03,186
As you attempt a right at an intersection,
an oncoming truck stops

158
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,274
and signals you to go ahead,
so you quickly make the right turn.

159
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,360
-That's false.
-You got it!

160
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:17,951
When entering a tunnel, you drop speed...

161
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,121
Oh wait, I can't read this character.

162
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,667
Zen... Zen...

163
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,627
You can just skip it.

164
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,671
By turning on so-and-so to see better,

165
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,383
you can enter at normal speed.

166
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,844
-False.
-You're correct!

167
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,055
-Yes!
-You have this all memorized.

168
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,516
Not at all.
These are all the problems I missed.

169
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,436
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, they're the ones I missed.

170
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,149
-Seriously though, good luck.
-Thanks.

171
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,985
-Don't worry.
-I really want to go somewhere.

172
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,364
-Where do you want to go?
-Anywhere! But get your license first.

173
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,825
I'd better study more.

174
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,910
-Every day.
-Every day.

175
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,831
-I'll give you quizzes.
-Okay.

176
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,292
-Do you have work today?
-Yeah.

177
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,043
-At what time?
-A live show.

178
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,754
-I'll be going soon.
-Really?

179
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,174
Study hard. For me.

180
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,051
I will.

181
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,847
-You go work hard.
-I will. See you later.

182
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,515
I'm gonna get ready.

183
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,475
-Good luck.
-I'll see you later.

184
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,146
-Are you coming home later?
-Yeah. It's only Yokohama.

185
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,986
GAIENMAE, TOKYO

186
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,781
-I'm super hungry.
-Yeah, I haven't eaten much today.

187
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,994
This is the first time the three of us
are getting together for drinks.

188
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,996
We've done it at home though.
Oh, this must be it.

189
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,665
-This is it.
-Yeah.

190
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,628
-Hello.
-Hello.

191
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,463
We've got the place to ourselves tonight.

192
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,926
Well, the owner is letting us
use the place after hours.

193
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,344
-Really?
-Yeah.

194
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,596
-Thanks.
-Thanks for coming.

195
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,808
How about a starter and then some pasta?

196
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,186
-Yeah, sounds great.
-Okay, I'll go make it.

197
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,229
-We leave it to you.
-Got it.

198
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,732
-Here's the starter.
-Bon appétit.

199
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,858
Looks delicious!

200
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,445
It's great.

201
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,281
You're going on another date with Misaki?

202
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,994
Yeah, so I've gotta get
my license on the first try.

203
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,997
Yeah, if you fail...

204
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,583
-It'd be bad.
-Yeah, embarrassing.

205
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,711
-She'd be my first passenger.
-Yeah.

206
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,755
Until then...

207
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,967
it'd be nice to know where things stand.

208
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,010
Why don't you just tell her how you feel?

209
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,138
I think it's too soon for that.

210
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:48,017
I think there's a 99% chance
she'd say yes.

211
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,978
What if I get rejected?

212
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,231
Just say something.

213
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,693
Thanks for waiting.
Here's the ragù sauce.

214
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,155
-This is young sardine, roe and zucchini.
-It looks amazing.

215
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,206
This is different from the norm.

216
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,000
So good!

217
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,836
-It's super good.
-It's so good!

218
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,796
I heard you guys talking about Misaki.

219
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,924
All he talks about is Misaki.

220
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,051
Oh, her birthday is next week!

221
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,970
-Yeah, it is.
-Why don't you plan something?

222
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,556
-When is it?
-The 25th.

223
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,435
-Oh, but she said she won't be here.
-Is that the day of the ballet?

224
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,978
Is it the 25th?

225
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,813
Then let's do something
either before or after.

226
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,898
Maybe we can plan something together?

227
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,277
Sure, we'll say you put it together.
You take the lead.

228
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,696
-Nice. She'll be happy.
-Yeah, I'll do it.

229
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,407
How are things going for you, Hayato?

230
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,451
Things with Riko...

231
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,329
-are at a standstill.
-Holding steady?

232
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,833
But are you thinking
of going out with her again? Or are you--

233
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,713
Even if we did, I wouldn't be sure
whether I can take things further.

234
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,008
That's true.
You couldn't even hold hands.

235
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,844
-It'd be like a school field trip again.
-A field trip?

236
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,723
She didn't ask you out
after she apologized?

237
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,183
-No, she didn't.
-I see.

238
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,352
-I wonder what she's thinking.
-I really don't know.

239
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,147
I think you should just clearly say it.

240
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,359
Expect us to move 10% as fast as you two.

241
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,446
You guys are moving pretty quick.

242
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:29,702
So really, Rikopin didn't shut him down.

243
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,871
-No.
-Or she didn't mean to.

244
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:36,876
But Hayato thought she did,
which explains what happened.

245
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,087
So she communicated that she's interested.

246
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,380
-She did.
-Right?

247
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:45,218
-There's no need for him to be uncertain.
-Yeah, why does he feel that way?

248
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,304
I mean, Riko expressed her feelings
as best she could.

249
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,849
Yes, to the point where
it could be taken as,

250
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,269
"I'm interested.
Please ask me out again."

251
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,105
-That's how she meant it, right?
-Yes.

252
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,564
Riko's being harsh.

253
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,442
If she's gonna reject him,
she should just do it.

254
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,028
But she likes him, doesn't she?

255
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,572
-No way!
-Isn't Hayato the one being harsh?

256
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,658
-Why?
-If we're talking harsh...

257
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,870
I mean, he brought it to the point
where she had to say all that...

258
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,039
-and he still doesn't get it.
-Yeah.

259
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,125
It's Hayato's turn right now.

260
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,669
-Right. The ball's in his court.
-It is.

261
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,587
And yet he's like...

262
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,464
"I don't know how she feels..."

263
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,175
So since she said
she didn't want to hold hands yet,

264
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,220
he's afraid that if he asked her out,
she'd say something like that again?

265
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,432
-He should just hold her hand anyway.
-That's right.

266
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,809
Oh, but he wouldn't want
his hand flung off.

267
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,270
Oh, like what happened to Tetsu long ago.

268
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,191
<i>Yes, Tetsu and Rie Kitano.</i>
<i>I watched it over and over.</i>

269
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,027
It's hard to say with these two
until they go on another date.

270
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,821
-That's true.
-Yeah.

271
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,491
On the flipside,
there's no stopping Byrnes and Misaki.

272
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,828
-It's so nice.
-Yeah, it's so great.

273
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:58,958
When I was about 30,
I forced my guy to do quizzes with me.

274
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,544
-So you can relive the experience?
-Yes, to experience that moment.

275
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,212
Do you understand?

276
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,799
Like, "I don't get this."
"Me neither."

277
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,176
That exchange.

278
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,511
"That's not right."
"Yes, it is!"

279
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,221
"Let's check the answer."

280
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,765
"See! I told you."

281
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,393
"What? That can't be right."

282
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,061
Seems like so much fun.

283
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,688
I can do that for hours.

284
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,650
-I'm gonna have to check out Amazon.
-Please do.

285
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,486
Workbooks are gonna sell like crazy.

286
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,447
What did you think of Byrnes' dancing?

287
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,407
It was wonderful.

288
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,203
That shirt
along with the striped sweatpants,

289
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,914
and his socks with the red shoes?

290
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,916
Only he could pull that off.

291
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,669
-That crazy combination?
-Yeah, maybe just him and Kentaro.

292
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,880
-You couldn't, right?
-Yeah.

293
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,175
But there was a time I dressed like that.

294
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,511
Looking back, I'm embarrassed.

295
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,514
Off to Mito for a tour -Misaki
One day until the competition.

296
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,308
-Tomorrow's a big day for both of you.
-Yeah. We can do it, Momo.

297
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,392
Yeah.

298
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,061
I'll be in Mito thinking of you.

299
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,813
I'll be in Shibuya thinking of you.

300
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,565
Be confident.

301
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,943
Yeah, I need to relax and be confident.

302
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,155
I wonder how it went for Yuuki.

303
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,449
-Oh, it was today.
-His driving test?

304
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,786
-He's not home yet?
-I haven't seen him.

305
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,248
-I'm going to be older in just a bit.
-That's right.

306
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:24,418
-In 20 more minutes.
-Oh, yeah!

307
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,588
I'm going to try
to stay up until midnight.

308
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,839
Yeah.

309
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,437
Welcome home.

310
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,235
Come on. Hurry.

311
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444
What?

312
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,698
Oh no, did it not go well?

313
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,496
What?

314
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,124
No way!

315
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,918
Really? You didn't pass?

316
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,966
No way. Really?

317
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,801
You failed?

318
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,262
I'm sorry, I failed.

319
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,641
I just turned 24 right now.

320
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,936
Seriously?

321
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,274
-I'm really sorry.
-You really failed?

322
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,609
Seriously?

323
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,156
I scored an 89. One point away.

324
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,699
One point?

325
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,202
Seriously?

326
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,121
First off, happy birthday.

327
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,170
I'm sorry I couldn't bring good news.

328
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,423
It's okay.
I have something to look forward to.

329
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,676
I'm really sorry, Misaki.

330
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,054
-It's okay.
-I'll get it soon.

331
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,223
As soon as I get it, let's go somewhere.
Seriously.

332
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,017
I definitely want to take you.

333
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,355
I'll always remember this birthday.

334
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,774
Happy birthday.

335
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,653
Yeah.

336
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,575
Zero days until the competition.
Keep calm and dance! Good luck!

337
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,411
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

338
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,207
-What are you making?
-Coffee.

339
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,417
-Did you see Arman?
-No.

340
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,003
-I think he went to work.
-So early.

341
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,421
-Isn't it early?
-Yeah.

342
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,758
-I want some too.
-Sure. I'm making a lot.

343
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,343
It's my first time making it.

344
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,680
What made you decide to try it today?

345
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,556
I can't go to the competition today.

346
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,894
So I thought I'd make some for Momo.

347
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,523
Good morning.

348
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,358
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

349
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
-Are you nervous?
-No.

350
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,863
-You're prepared?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

351
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,074
Dance as if you're the star.

352
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,245
-Even though it's only two minutes long.
-You have to show it in two minutes.

353
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:11,043
Two minutes will decide my fate
after having danced ballet for 16 years.

354
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,630
The people who know will see it though.

355
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,965
What I've done all these years?

356
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,093
You can tell
the moment someone stands on stage.

357
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,304
-Be one of those people.
-Yeah.

358
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,765
Just coffee today?

359
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,392
Be confident.

360
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,480
Is the coffee ready?

361
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,482
-Looks great!
-Go ahead.

362
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,901
Bon appétit.

363
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,450
It's perfect.

364
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,246
-Good luck. Do your best.
-I will.

365
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,123
Thank you.

366
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,752
-Good luck!
-I'm going now.

367
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,630

380
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,720
She did well.

381
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,931
But I'm sure she's frustrated.

382
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:57,144
First place in the senior category,
Miss Aoi Hinata.

383
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,357
We present this award to you
for your excellent performance

384
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,693
in the Ninth Annual
All Japan Ballet Competition.

385
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,369
-How was it for you?
-Yeah.

386
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,914
I'm frustrated, to be honest.

387
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,542
I really wanted to make the top three.

388
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,088
So, I'm frustrated.

389
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,048
So what's gonna happen now?

390
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,635
-I mean...
-You mean after?

391
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,762
I'm sort of in a panic right now.

392
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,472
-You are?
-Yes.

393
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,434
You know how the curtains closed after?

394
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,480
Afterwards, I was called over...

395
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,068
and I got an offer from a ballet company.

396
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,277
What?

397
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,699
I'll be a professional dancer
starting next week.

398
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,827
-Wow!
-Seriously?

399
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,788
-Congratulations!
-You scared me.

400
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,289
That's amazing!

401
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,584
-You made pro, but you're down?
-Yeah.

402
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,003
I'm still frustrated.
I wanted to make the top three...

403
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,589
That doesn't matter now that you made pro!

404
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,966
Right?

405
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,510
That's what you were working hard for.

406
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:16,473
I know, but I still wanted to win.

407
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,768
And if you got the offer on top of that,
then you would've been ecstatic.

408
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,936
That's true.

409
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,565
I have to work harder than ever before.

410
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,775
-It's still amazing.
-Yeah.

411
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,360
-I'm still in shock.
-Amazing.

412
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,779
My dream came true.

413
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,115
That's a serious congrats to you.

414
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,950
Congratulations.

415
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,493
Wow!

416
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,245
It's a happy day.

417
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,999
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

418
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,042
-I'm so glad.
-Yeah.

419
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,129
It sounded like her dreams would end
if she didn't make top three.

420
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,797
But I guess people who know, know.

421
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,718
It's really only a handful
that can make pro, right?

422
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,304
It must be a truly amazing accomplishment.

423
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,057
Now that she's going pro,
what'll happen with Arman?

424
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,311
Yeah, it was supposed to be on hold
until after the competition.

425
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:07,608
I don't think she should be messing around
with Arman if she's gonna be a pro.

426
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,776
That's true.

427
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,402
He's not a bad guy or anything.

428
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,697
He's not, but we haven't seen
anything cool from him either.

429
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,616
-He's been here awhile now.
-Right?

430
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,952
I don't care
if he's good at making takoyaki, right?

431
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,913
-Anything.
-You want him to show something.

432
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,081
Yeah, he needs to show something.

433
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,459
-Something unexpected.
-Yeah, he needs it.

434
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,004
What's really surprising is
Byrnes failed his driving test.

435
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,466
-Yeah.
-Is the test difficult?

436
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,134
People don't fail too often?

437
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,303
Do people fail the written exam?

438
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,683
But even if he failed,
she said he just has to try again.

439
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,186
I love that.

440
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,314
It's cute even though he failed.

441
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,318
Misaki tells him it made her birthday
more memorable this way.

442
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,694
Beautiful.

443
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:56,281
He said he definitely wanted to take her
on a ride.

444
00:26:56,365 --> 00:27:00,536
When he said that, I thought,
"Oh no, a lewd comment!"

445
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,539
Even I didn't think that.

446
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,937
"Happy birthday," and then bang.

447
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:31,233
-I'm--
-Happy birthday!

448
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,154
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

449
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,073
-Happy birthday!
-Thanks.

450
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,826
It's so cute! I'm so happy! Thank you.

451
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,578
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

452
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,662
Thanks.

453
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,622
Here it comes.

454
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,500
-Is this the main?
-Yeah.

455
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,335
Seriously, thanks, Hayato.

456
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,004
-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit.

457
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,089
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

458
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,842
I'm back.

459
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,176
Looks delicious.

460
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,762
-It's so good.
-Yeah, thanks.

461
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,847
Oh, man...

462
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,391
-How about some meat, Riko?
-I want some.

463
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,978
Thank you.

464
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,192
Thank you.

465
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,487
This is amazing. Let's have some after.

466
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,865
-Yeah.
-You want to eat it later?

467
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,617
Then let's do gifts.

468
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,951
Yeah!

469
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,079
Happy birthday.

470
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:33,629
It's from a brand I like,
and I wanted you to wear it.

471
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,088
Nice!

472
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,175
-Wait a sec!
-What?

473
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,093
-Never mind.
-What?

474
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,012
I want you to try it on later.

475
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,349
I'm embarrassed.

476
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,936
-Why? You can do a fashion show.
-Why don't you just wear it now?

477
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,230
Go try it on!

478
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,274
-While we're not looking?
-Yeah.

479
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,778
-This is nice.
-Yeah, it is.

480
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,281
It looks amazing on you!

481
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,533
-It's so cute!
-Really?

482
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,994
It's so cute!

483
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,205
It looks good.

484
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,916
-Really?
-Let's see, let's see.

485
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,459
Spin around.

486
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,464
-It's very feminine.
-Right?

487
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,508
-It's cute!
-I'm so embarrassed!

488
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,885
Come back.

489
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,680
I'll wear it for a special occasion.

490
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,474
-Okay.
-I'm gonna go change. I'm so embarrassed!

491
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,812
Why is she embarrassed?
She looks so good!

492
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,106
It was really cute.

493
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,192
-It looked good on her, right?
-Yeah, it did.

494
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,195
-You wanted to see more?
-I did.

495
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,076
You should seriously wear it
whenever you feel like it.

496
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,078
I will.

497
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,539
-Really?
-Yeah.

498
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,041
-Really.
-It really looked good on you.

499
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,627
Your license though...

500
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,796
You don't know when you can get it.

501
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,425
Does that mean we won't go anywhere
until then?

502
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,760
No, let's go somewhere.

503
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,305
As long as it's not Yokohama or Shonan.

504
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,181
You don't want to go there that bad?

505
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,267
I feel like it's bad luck.

506
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,936
Like...

507
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,481
-The bad luck...
-It won't go well if we go there?

508
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,983
Yeah.

509
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,320
Even if you went with a different guy?

510
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,199
You're right. I'm wrong.

511
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,119
-That doesn't sound right.
-You're right.

512
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,330
But it's still scary.

513
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,623
What is?

514
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,419
Never mind.

515
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,505
What are you afraid of? Tell me.

516
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,507
What's so scary?

517
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,886
That even if you like someone...

518
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,057
and even if that person liked you back...

519
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,893
that may change.

520
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
So you're worried about that?

521
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,355
Yeah.

522
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,072
-Let's go somewhere.
-Yeah, we should.

523
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,622
Don't stare at me.

524
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,836
I like you, Misaki.

525
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,929
You're kidding, right? Wait...

526
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,931
Why would I kid about that?

527
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,518
Here? I mean...

528
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:49,032
It's only gonna be on your forehead.

529
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,077
-Just your forehead...
-Wait, wait.

530
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,245
Wait.

531
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,039
-Wait, I'm not ready.
-I'm like the weird guy.

532
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,504
It's been a long time since I...

533
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,005
Oh, man!

534
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,966
Let's go back.

535
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,592
Let's go join everyone.

536
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,929
-You can go ahead.
-Why?

537
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,055
Just go ahead of me.

538
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,223
I'm going.
