1
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,223
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,934
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,560
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,438
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,191
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,526
There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,738
First, Natsumi...

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,990
or Princess Natsumi, is back from China.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,786
She's scared of her
after that last episode.

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,870
It's okay.

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:41,208
-Arman and Natsumi head to Enoshima.
-That's right.

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,918
-They went.
-Yes, they went.

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,128
You sound like you're reporting
the royal family news.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,214
"Princess Natsumi has visited Enoshima."

15
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,549
About Arisa...

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,176
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,261
Do you really like her?

18
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,596
Yeah, I do.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,932
I want to be in love, too.

20
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,644
That could've been her making an appeal.

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,563
But later on...

22
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,857
-I went to Shonan.
-By yourself?

23
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,442
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD

24
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,527
Of course not!
With Arman.

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,778
Why?

26
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,239
-What do you mean?
-For fun?

27
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
It's just sudden.

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,367
-What? Sudden?
-What?

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,162
It just sounds like you're mad at me.

30
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,747
<i>They're both at fault.</i>

31
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,873
It's an accumulation.

32
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,500
If they got mad over one thing,

33
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,086
then they could reason it out
how it happened and solve it.

34
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,381
-But they're all intertwined.
-And from there...

35
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,427
-The house meeting.
-That house meeting was scary.

36
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,640
I didn't really like
the way Minori was talking to me.

37
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,725
Her tone...

38
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,186
Minori denied it,
saying that was not how she meant it.

39
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,231
So that was me just honestly asking.

40
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,067
But you kept taking it as criticism.

41
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,028
You've just misunderstood each other.

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,195
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD

43
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,364
So let's not let this happen again.

44
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,991
Cheers!

45
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,453
If you brush it off like that,

46
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,580
the friendship
will always remain superficial.

47
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>This honest exchange of feelings,</i>

48
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,085
you clearly see
this is how people build relationships.

49
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,963
The current mood at <i>Terrace House</i>
is horrible.

50
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,590
-Horrible.
-The worst!

51
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:16,887
And the worst part was,
in the middle of the talk,

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,348
when it was nonchalantly mentioned
that Arman still likes Arisa.

53
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,935
So he told you why, right?

54
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,898
That he likes Arisa,
and as a roommate, you'd help.

55
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,734
You had that conversation, right?

56
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,404
Wow, I wonder
where we're gonna start this episode?

57
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,741
It'll be scary
if it's from the middle of the meeting.

58
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,455
It's easy to say, "Okay, we're done."

59
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:50,921
To figure out what went wrong or to say
who was at fault is the easy way out.

60
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,467
If there's something you don't like,
no one will know if you don't speak up.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,722
But, like Minori, there are people
who just aren't that type.

62
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,808
Which makes it difficult.

63
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:07,229
But if something bothers you,

64
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,649
I think it's better to say it
in any way you can.

65
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,653
If we're going to live together,
it's better to voice it.

66
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,614
Otherwise, what happened yesterday
will happen again.

67
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:22,869
I think it's important to figure it out,
but it's a matter of personality.

68
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,330
You're the type
who wants to get to the bottom of things.

69
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,708
No, we're not just talking friendship.

70
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,838
That's fine
if you're just hanging out for the day.

71
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,340
But living together...

72
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,593
Why don't you hear her out first,
and then respond.

73
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,470
The same goes for you.

74
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,472
You're interrupting me.

75
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,892
Not everyone is like you.

76
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,644
-I understand that.
-You do, right?

77
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,689
-So Minori has her own personality.
-I know that, too.

78
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,442
So I'm just asking you to hear her out.

79
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,404
Minori wants it
to be phrased better, right?

80
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,073
-But...
-Nacchan's words sound harsh to you.

81
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,450
I don't mind that.

82
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,994
And I'm not asking her to change.

83
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,748
But the way you say things
can be controlled in that moment, right?

84
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,459
As far as my personality goes,

85
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,462
I don't think
the change is something to be forced.

86
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,088
I just think, "Oh, well."

87
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,301
There's no need to change yourself
for someone else.

88
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,303
I think so, too.

89
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,889
-Not yourself, just how you word things.
-How you say it.

90
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:30,312
If we don't compromise a little,
there are some areas that won't work out.

91
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,191
If we don't try to understand each other,

92
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,318
this will happen again.

93
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,506

SHABU SHABU ONYASAI

101
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,746
You made that "don" thing, right?

102
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,122
The poke don?

103
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,833
How did Arisa like it?

104
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,167
She said it was good.

105
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,673
I wish it hadn't been
under those circumstances.

106
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,049
That's true.

107
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,761
-You told her your feelings though, right?
-I did.

108
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,471
Why don't you tell her again?

109
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,516
I do want to ask her.

110
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,396
The next time I ask her out for dinner,
I'll ask how she really feels about me.

111
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,732
-The feelings are there, I think.
-Seriously?

112
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,734
-Yeah.
-Yeah, for real.

113
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,237
Why don't you go on a date with someone?

114
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,782
Either way, there has to be
more conversation.

115
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,827
But I guess going out to eat would work.

116
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,289
A date is
a way to get to know them, right?

117
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,124
That's true.

118
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,002
What about the fireman thing?

119
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,296
Or work, I mean...

120
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,715
I don't have anything
from the place in Kamakura right now.

121
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,300
Wanna come work at my place?

122
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,594
The construction company.

123
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,803
I can work with you?

124
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,138
-Yeah.
-Seriously?

125
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,056
-Yeah, together.
-Like Tom Sawyer?

126
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,182
Yeah.

127
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,143
-Sounds good.
-Yeah. It'll be fun.

128
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,938
It'll start either this week or next week.

129
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,482
-The project in Nakano.
-For real? Then...

130
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,651
-You'll do it?
-Will you ask for me?

131
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,862
-You'll come?
-Yeah.

132
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,572
I'll lend you the outfit then.

133
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,617
It'll be fun working with you.

134
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,128
This is the first time the three of us
are having breakfast together.

135
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,465
We're never home.

136
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,217
We all have different schedules.

137
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,554
-You're both off today?
-Yes.

138
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
No, I've got to go to Aoyama for 4:00 p.m.

139
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,267
Oh, your audition.

140
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,402
Thanks for the food, Minori.

141
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,654
Thank you.

142
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,738
Of course.

143
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,743
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

144
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,704
It was delicious.

145
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,877
What's this?

146
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,547
This here, what is it?

147
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,632
Oh, it's meat.

148
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,759
-Meat?
-Uchi got it as a gift.

149
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,303
-Wow.
-Huge steaks.

150
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,847
It's in a wooden box.

151
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,434
Oh, wow! Look at this!

152
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,686
Amazing, right?

153
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,479
-Wow!
-Oh, it's Hidagyu.

154
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,648
I don't know how to cook it.

155
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,026
Just salt and pepper would be
probably enough for this.

156
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,821
-That's true.
-Wow.

157
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,907
-Maybe cooked medium...
-Yeah.

158
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,994
-Or even rare.
-That's true.

159
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,037
-Wow.
-Wow, Uchi.

160
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,542
-I'm going now.
-Bye.

161
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,210
Thanks for the food.

162
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,606
I just heard today that Minori's leaving.

163
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,860
At the end of February.

164
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,238
-What? When did she say that?
-I just heard today.

165
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,283
She's going to leave
when she graduates university.

166
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,536
Are they related somehow?

167
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,079
Not really.

168
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,958
-It's good timing?
-Yeah.

169
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,419
What'll you do when Minori leaves?

170
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,421
I'd probably leave then, too.

171
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,884
If you do, would you get an apartment
and live together?

172
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,928
I don't know yet.

173
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,472
I might live on my own.

174
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,184
When you have different priorities...

175
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,063
-You have different priorities?
-Yeah.

176
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,858
Well, our views towards work
are different.

177
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,029
I want to work hard right now.

178
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:37,660
She's fine with minimal finances
as long as she can have a normal life.

179
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,288
Kind of like that.

180
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,874
It would've been great
if we were just friends.

181
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,959
But if we're going to be
in a relationship...

182
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,253
then I think...

183
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,215
we should have similar goals.

184
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,218
Yeah, you could motivate each other.

185
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:59,891
At first, she quit her other job
and said she'd focus on her modelling.

186
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,312
But lately she's either just at home
or going out.

187
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,773
I've been...

188
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,443
a little concerned about that lately.

189
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,195
We've talked about it before,

190
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,907
but she just says
she knows what she's doing.

191
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,492
She's just living off modeling, right?

192
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,993
-Yeah.
-Or is she?

193
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,080
She said she can get by.

194
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,958
-So then she's here when she's off.
-I can't get by with just modeling.

195
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,544
On her computer or watching TV...

196
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,337
And she says she's...

197
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,089
perfectly happy doing that.

198
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,342
That's fine if that's the case.

199
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,596
Oh, it's Nacchan.

200
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,932
-Who'd you think it was?
-You couldn't tell?

201
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,977
-You have bad vision?
-No, it's 20/20.

202
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,687
20/20 and you couldn't tell?

203
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,648
-20/20 is pretty good.
-It's perfect.

204
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,066
Oh, yeah.

205
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,945
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

206
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,448
The three of us had breakfast
for the first time this morning.

207
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,784
-Well, more like lunch...
-Which three?

208
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,536
Minori and Asari, not Asari...

209
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,872
Asari? That's bad.

210
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,833
I meant Arisa.

211
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,627
What do you girls talk about?

212
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,963
It's light stuff.

213
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,385
-We avoid mentioning the other day.
-I see.

214
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,970
-Minori's home, right?
-Yeah.

215
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,848
Do the two of you talk?

216
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,976
Not really.

217
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,144
You don't get along?

218
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,897
-We're not close.
-Well, you're probably just different.

219
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,400
Do you know about Minori?

220
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,444
-That she's leaving?
-Yeah.

221
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,404
So, before then...

222
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,532
I'd like for our relationship to change.

223
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,425
You scared me.

224
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,554
-Going to sleep?
-No.

225
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,723
-I wanted to talk.
-About?

226
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,683
You said you're leaving, right?

227
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,729
-So I am going to leave, too...
-Together?

228
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,648
Yeah, at the same time.

229
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,192
-End of February, is it?
-Yeah.

230
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,236
End of February.

231
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:22,700
Does it need to be timed with your school?

232
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,577
There's a month left.

233
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:29,874
If there's no merit being here...

234
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,212
I thought maybe I could only enjoy this
while I was still a student.

235
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,005
That's...

236
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,467
-Not right?
-Yeah, maybe not.

237
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,927
What's not right about it?

238
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,804
I thought maybe...

239
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,933
it'd be good to have
some kind of goal here...

240
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,561
so that it would benefit you.

241
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:57,110
But to just rely on this environment
or to just live easy feels wrong.

242
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,529
What do you want me to do?

243
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,865
-You want me to just leave?
-I'm not sure.

244
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,536
But I don't want you
to just pass time here.

245
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm not here just because it's fun,
and I'm not just lying around.

246
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,752
How are things with Nacchan?

247
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,006
-It's awkward.
-Right?

248
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,427
You're used to withdrawing
and just giving up.

249
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,096
You tend to avoid
things that take effort.

250
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,683
Maybe that's something you can work on.

251
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:34,605
If there's an opportunity for growth,
maybe that's a good thing.

252
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:41,487
You quit your job
so that you could focus on modeling.

253
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:46,701
But I feel like you were more focused
when you were working.

254
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,790
I think right before the Girls Award show
was when you were working the hardest.

255
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,293
Why did you want to be with me?

256
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,337
You're easy to be with.

257
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,549
But I'm not the type to motivate.

258
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,968
No, you're not.

259
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,679
Is being with me
different than you imagined?

260
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,057
No, it's not that.

261
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:15,480
So this next month, maybe
you can think about what you can do

262
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,233
to try and show some growth.

263
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,196
I think about that, too. About growth...

264
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,073
I think it's your attitude.

265
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,949
Why don't you listen to me?

266
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,789
That's what I think.

267
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,832
I understand.

268
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,378
I'll think over what you said.

269
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,963
Is it too much to deal with?

270
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,590
-What?
-Is it too much to deal with?

271
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:47,178
Are you just saying that to end this talk?

272
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,015
-I did think that.
-I figured.

273
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,476
That's the part, I think, is bad.

274
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,688
I got upset because I tried to talk,
and you didn't listen to me.

275
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,774
That's what I mean.

276
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,858
It's that.

277
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,403
Just shut up and watch.

278
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,488
Okay.

279
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,282
I'll shut up and watch.

280
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,791
-This is messed up.
-This is a little...

281
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,086
When they were having breakfast,

282
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,380
Natsumi made...

283
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,634
some effort and tried to be friendly.

284
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,927
She did.

285
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,805
She found the meat and said,
"What's this?"

286
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:35,601
-I felt her effort.
-We all did.

287
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:41,190
But after such a big argument,
the power of meat is amazing.

288
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,485
-The power of Hidagyu.
-The power of Hidagyu.

289
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,112
There was an English label.

290
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,823
-The labels were fancy!
-Yeah, they were.

291
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,577
Things between Minori and Tatsuya
are a mess.

292
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,955
He clearly said they didn't match.

293
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
It was good before, but now its...

294
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,292
different.

295
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,880
Well, for Minori herself and her life,

296
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,425
maybe a little change on her part...

297
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,302
is necessary.

298
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,305
She must be pretty lazy
when the cameras aren't on.

299
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,973
She's at home all the time.

300
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,186
When something she doesn't like happens,
she shuts down.

301
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,146
She has that kind of attitude.

302
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,859
I think Uchi has noticed that about her
over the last little while.

303
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,487
I wonder who Hikaru will ask out?

304
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,114
-Arisa.
-Arisa, of course.

305
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,074
"You should,"

306
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,034
is what Aman meant?

307
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,203
While eating Shabu-Shabu meat,

308
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,163
he said, "You should ask her out."

309
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,540
He did say that.

310
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,544
Arman is worse than Pepper.

311
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,260
Need me to tear?
Oh, you did it.

312
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,637
-I did.
-I'm back.

313
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,846
Welcome home.

314
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,438
Oh, meat.

315
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,190
-You cooked the meat?
-Do you want some?

316
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,901
-Did you eat already?
-Just a bit.

317
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,361
Do you want some good meat?

318
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll pass

319
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,032
even though I wanna eat.

320
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:18,120
-But will he be upset if we use it all?
-I'm sure it's fine.

321
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,124
-Is it just the two of you?
-Yeah.

322
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,505
-Nacchan, when's your next day off?
-My day off?

323
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,633
Near the end of January.

324
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,301
Do you want to go have dinner?

325
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,511
Dinner?

326
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,558
Sure, let's go.

327
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,394
Are you sure? If you're busy--

328
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,939
No, I'm free in the evenings.

329
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,275
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

330
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,610
What? Where were you?

331
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,529
-I was at the gym.
-I see.

332
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,447
Are you making dinner?

333
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,449
I thought I'd cook Uchi's meat.

334
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,786
-It looks delicious.
-It's a luxury.

335
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,080
You should leave two pieces at least.
Small ones.

336
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,833
-Leave some?
-But it'll go bad if he doesn't eat it.

337
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,628
Maybe we should eat it.

338
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,007
What's your plan tomorrow, Hikaru?

339
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,426
I have construction work.

340
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,470
Oh, starting next week,
I'll be joining Hikaru.

341
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,930
Oh, yeah, Arman's coming.

342
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,683
-Really?
-I called my boss today.

343
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,518
You're going to wear them, too?

344
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,229
The parachute pants?

345
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,690
-Parachute pants?
-Is that what you call them?

346
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,151
-I don't know. They're like parachutes.
-Super long.

347
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,904
I saw Hikaru in them once.

348
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,449
It's really embarrassing
to wear them on the train.

349
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,868
Why? They're cool.
You look good in them.

350
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,162
Really?

351
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,248
It's huge.

352
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,381
It smells really good.

353
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,342
-It smells good.
-Yeah.

354
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,136
-I think that's good.
-Is it?

355
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,268
Watch out.

356
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,728
Looks amazing.

357
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,649
-Where are you going?
-I was gonna watch a movie.

358
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,150
-Got it.
-You're not eating?

359
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,610
It's okay.

360
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,866
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

361
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,160
-Thanks, Uchi.
-Thank you.

362
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,412
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

363
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,956
Bon appétit.

364
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,293
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

365
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,795
Wow, is this for real?

366
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,095
That's all you want?

367
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,430
-For real?
-I'm eating most of it, is that okay?

368
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,099
Can I eat it?

369
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,975
It's not my favorite.

370
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,894
-This?
-Yeah, it's a little fatty.

371
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,479
Yeah, it's got a lot of fat.

372
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,526
SAMEZU, TOKYO

373
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,531
<i>PEARY GATES</i> SHOOT

374
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,742
-How long have you lived there?
-It's been...

375
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,037
only a month still.

376
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,667
Is there anyone you're attracted to?

377
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,460
There's a guy from Hawaii.

378
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,838
His name is Arman.

379
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,093
We get along, but he's always home.

380
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,595
I wish...

381
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,556
I wish he'd work more.

382
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,182
He doesn't work?

383
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,935
Off and on.

384
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,019
Really?

385
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,397
Great personality though.

386
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,400
I wouldn't recommend a guy like him.

387
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,404
It should be someone who works.

388
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,449
And the new guy who arrived
at the same time as me...

389
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,411
his personality is totally my type.

390
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:50,583
Manly, but a little boyish,
straightforward...

391
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,877
but he's 18.

392
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,086
So young!

393
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,005
Eighteen, huh?

394
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,802
If he was 27 or something,
I would've totally fell for him.

395
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,305
Ready.

396
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,643
Cute.

397
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,860
Nice.

398
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,629
-I'm back.
-Welcome home.

399
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,049
-You're alone?
-Yeah.

400
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,138
-Hi.
-Welcome back. I mean, I'm back.

401
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,307
Welcome home.

402
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,397
Oh, there's Chamisul here.

403
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,441
Chamisul?

404
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,443
It's a Korean sake.

405
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,037
You finished the meat.
Finally.

406
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,582
What's wrong?

407
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,793
-Is everything okay?
-What?

408
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,753
I don't know.

409
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,090
I don't know, but he was quiet.

410
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,643
-Hi.
-Welcome back.

411
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,941
The meat is all gone.

412
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,527
About that...

413
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,070
Oh, yeah.

414
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,073
Yeah, about that...

415
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,408
I wanna say something...

416
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,911
Oh, about that?

417
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm kind of bothered by that.

418
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,167
You're mad?

419
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,877
Yeah, I'm pretty upset.

420
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,299
Where did the meat go?

421
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,759
I had some of the meat.

422
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,053
We had it for dinner last night.

423
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,138
Why?

424
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,516
I didn't have any.

425
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,726
Why?

426
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,812
There wasn't anything else
to make dinner with.

427
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,189
Isn't that a little strange?

428
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,028
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:31,118
That meat was from a client who came
all the way from Nagoya to visit Blast.

430
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,203
They run a Yakiniku Restaurant.

431
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:38,834
They liked their haircuts and our service,
and they went back to Nagoya happy.

432
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,795
And they sent the meat from Nagoya.

433
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,715
They even wrote a letter
saying how to eat it.

434
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,969
Explaining exactly how we should cook it.

435
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,305
They specifically wrote a letter about
how to eat it.

436
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,684
I told you that this was from a client.

437
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,023
And that it was from Nagoya.

438
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,780
I have a relationship with my clients.

439
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,075
There's value in the gift.

440
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,619
I'm sorry we ate it without permission.

441
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,789
Of course I'd be upset.

442
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:28,717
It's hard to draw the line
for things in the fridge.

443
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,012
That's not what I'm talking about.

444
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,931
It was obviously different.

445
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,477
The line doesn't matter here.

446
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,230
I'm very sorry.

447
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,525
Whatever.

448
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,795
He's mad we ate it yesterday?

449
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,714
I hadn't told him about it.

450
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,221
I get where he's coming from.

451
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,391
I get it, but...

452
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,147
-We shouldn't have.
-He should've just told us before.

453
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,484
But we should've asked him first, too.
Maybe we were wrong.

454
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,612
-We were definitely wrong.
-Usually, you would...

455
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,532
leave a note, "Don't touch."

456
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,868
No, we were wrong.

457
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,036
It's not enough to apologize.

458
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,998
That's all we can do.

459
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,168
That's all I can do.

460
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,627
I'll apologize.

461
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,464
But he's so mad.

462
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,804
This is so entertaining.

463
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,807
I didn't know these things happened.

464
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,892
You've got to be kidding.

465
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,352
-In the year 2016.
-You've got to be kidding.

466
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,689
This is new for <i>Terrace House.</i>

467
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,649
This incident has been recorded.

468
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,068
The meat crime topped everything.

469
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,947
The meat crime?

470
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,992
People really get angry at meat crimes.

471
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,452
I thought, "No way."

472
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:23,499
When Uchi seemed unhappy,
and the camera cut to the empty meat box,

473
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,167
I thought, "No, that can't be it."

474
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,130
-I think we all felt that.
-We all thought, "No way."

475
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,132
"That can't be it."

476
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,010
I mean, no one would write a script as,

477
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,429
-"The Meat Crime."
-No way.

478
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,848
-It's so insignificant.
-It would've been vetoed.

479
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,519
Yeah, like who cares.
The meat crime would never happen.

480
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,145
I wonder what he'll think
after he watches this episode?

481
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,689
"Minori said she didn't like it."

482
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,108
-She said it was fatty.
-That's right.

483
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,695
Oh, no. And the client might see it.

484
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,364
And the line from the 18-year-old.

485
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,325
"If you don't want us to eat it,
you should leave a note."

486
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,204
Hikaru is right, though.

487
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,288
He's right.

488
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,958
There was a scene like this
in <i>Under One Roof.</i>

489
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,878
The brother got mad
about his pudding being eaten,

490
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,382
saying, "You guys ate it
without telling me."

491
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,675
There was a scene like that.

492
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,553
-He should've approached it that way.
-That's right.

493
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,849
There was no need for such a serious tone.

494
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:26,520
I understand Uchi values his client

495
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,523
and their thoughtfulness,

496
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,316
but everyone else didn't know that.

497
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,819
The way he approached it was too dark.

498
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,114
-Way too dark.
-Yeah, dark.

499
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,616
He's not saying anything wrong, but...

500
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,368
But this...

501
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,161
This...

502
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,372
What should I do?

503
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,792
I'm going to crack up during the scene
when Minori apologizes.

504
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,255
"I'm sorry, but I ate the meat."

505
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,341
So, right now, I hope
she goes to the Japanese-style room,

506
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,136
and I hope they start talking
about meat again.

507
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,513
Like, "So, how'd you cook it?"

508
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,557
-Wouldn't that be hilarious?
-Yeah.

509
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,393
"That's not
how you're supposed to cook it."

510
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,978
"But it was so fatty..."

511
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,814
-"Did you add oil?"
-"I did."

512
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,776
"It's a teflon pan, so you didn't need to.

513
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,904
It's quality meat; it has fat already."

514
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,280
"I'm so sorry."

515
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,199
"That's not enough."

516
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,828
That's totally what he might say.

517
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,414
"Your apology won't bring back the meat."

518
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,791
She should just go buy some meat.

519
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,127
I really hope we end with that scene.

520
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,880
It's been so serious lately.

521
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,506
A light-hearted crime...

522
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,511
If the meat crime is his plan to distract
Natsumi and Minori from their fight,

523
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:46,266
and if it's a part of Uchi's master plan,
I'd be really impressed.

524
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,351
That's true!

525
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,396
Ah, a common enemy to allowing bonding.

526
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,731
How cool is Uchi!

527
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,566
That definitely did not happen!

528
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,446
They might break up over this.

529
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,699
Her boyfriend got mad
because she ate his meat.

530
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,244
You'd be okay with this?

531
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,872
If it were me getting lectured
about meat in front of everyone...

532
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:13,752
-Well, he's upset on behalf of his client.
-That's right.

533
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,922
But if you're asked why you broke up...

534
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,552
-Break up caused by meat.
-Break up caused by meat.

535
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,765
"Yeah, I ate his meat."

536
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,188
And if he's asked why they broke up,
he'd say that she ate my meat...

537
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,773
Tori-chan's cracking up.

538
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,026
-You shouldn't laugh.
-It's gonna come back to you.

539
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,861
Tori-chan can't stop.

540
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,824
That was a treat.

541
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:48,537
Seriously, it's my first time
witnessing a break up caused by meat.

542
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,709
Uchi.

543
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,628
Sorry about before.

544
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,050
It's a mess in here.

545
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:07,347
I totally thought
it was for everyone to share.

546
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,058
No, it wasn't.

547
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,143
But...

548
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,229
was it something to get so mad about?

549
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,523
You were pretty upset.

550
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,027
I know it's just meat to you guys.

551
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,530
But it was something
that meant a lot to me.

552
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:29,494
So for you guys, just to go and eat it
like it was nothing

553
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,788
made me really upset.

554
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,877
Like if you got something
from someone special,

555
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,004
and if it was treated carelessly...

556
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,632
-Yeah.
-It's the same feeling.

557
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,219
I worked really hard.

558
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:53,185
And it was my client's recognition
and appreciation of my hard work.

559
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,730
So, for me, it meant a lot.

560
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,651
I understand that you didn't know.

561
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,363
So maybe it couldn't be helped.

562
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,325
But I had told Minori
and she still ate it.

563
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,996
I'm really starting to get angry at her.

564
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,415
She didn't tell me
after you guys ate it...

565
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,168
or even before.

566
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,256
And I came home
and found the meat was gone.

567
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,300
Isn't there something wrong there?

568
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:26,927
Yeah.

569
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:32,432
I was mad that it was all gone
when I got home.

570
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:36,311
Either way, I'm sorry.

571
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,773
I need to zone out for a bit.

572
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,650
I don't want to think about anything.

573
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,735
I'll get too upset.

574
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,446
I'm going to the store.
You want anything?

575
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,575
-I'm okay for now.
-A bento or anything?

576
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,328
-You haven't eaten, right?
-I'm okay.

577
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,165
Goodnight then.
I'm sorry.

578
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,532
I'm really sorry.

579
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,034
I know it's all I can say, but I'm sorry.

580
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,791
I can't calm down right now,
no matter what you say.

581
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,472
Goodnight.
