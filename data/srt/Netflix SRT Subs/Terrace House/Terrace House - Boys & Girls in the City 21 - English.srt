1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,389
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,769
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,521
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,982
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,401
There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,448
Previously, two new members moved in.

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,576
-Hikaru and Natsumi.
-That's right.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,995
I think Arisa is cute.

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,330
HIKARU OTA, 18 YEARS OLD

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,666
I'm usually not bothered by other guys.

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,085
Don't worry about me.
Just go for it.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,462
I'll make my move then.

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,965
<i>He's got the passionate Italian blood.</i>

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,634
He clearly tells Arman his intentions.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,886
"Oh, really, that's good."

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,932
"Oh, really, that's fine with me.

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,976
I think that's fine."

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,688
Only the bottom half
of Arman's face moves.

20
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,773
The top half reveals no expression.

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,152
Maybe he's had a lot of Botox done.

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,238
-Do you like the ocean?
-I love the ocean.

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,489
Me, too.

24
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,992
Then let's explore Japanese beaches.

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,493
Sure, I'm usually free.

26
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,161
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD

27
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,957
The spirited and aggressive Osaka accent
of the Kansai dialect.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,417
-Yes.
-Natsumi.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,669
That led to the development
of the Kansai Dilemma.

30
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,795
The Kansai Dilemma?

31
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,589
The first Kansai Dilemma in <i>Terrace House.</i>

32
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,759
Minori experienced Kansai firsthand.

33
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,430
But couples
that are always making fun of each other,

34
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,223
I don't really understand.

35
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,767
It's harder to imagine them kissing.

36
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:41,935
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

37
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,812
-Do you have to be able to imagine it?
-No, but...

38
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,938
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD

39
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,440
You guys are probably
just complete opposites.

40
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,359
Total opposites.

41
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,988
She wouldn't let it go.
I was a little ticked.

42
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,158
TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 24 YEARS OLD

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,660
-She's scary.
-Scary?

44
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,747
-She clearly said she's scared.
-She did.

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,958
-She doesn't have bad intentions.
-Her intentions are good.

46
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,085
It was just Kansai style teasing.

47
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,880
Arisa is a little busy right now.

48
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,342
-Her exhibition is coming up.
-That's right.

49
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,886
There's potential for new relationships.

50
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,597
-And between Minori and Natsumi...
-That's right.

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,141
how will the Kansai Dilemma
be resolved?

52
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,768
If it gets resolved.

53
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,312
And the way Arisa rejected Arman.

54
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,191
Let's have everyone remember
how terrible she was.

55
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,987
She's busy with her work now,
and things have been left at that.

56
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,574
But let's all keep questioning
whether her actions were human.

57
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,371
His dark side is in control now.

58
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,748
I can't see anything else.

59
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,458
Yes, you are wearing a necklace after all.

60
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,003
Bad boys wear necklaces, right?

61
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,302
Arisa seems busy.
Have you talked?

62
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,970
Not recently.

63
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,517
I want to, but I don't want to bother her.

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,477
She does seem really busy.

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,188
It's not a great time to ask for a date.

66
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,564
Why don't you do something for her?

67
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,360
Yeah, I've told her to let me know
if there's anything I can help with.

68
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,445
Why don't you cook for her?

69
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,950
She did say it'd be nice to have
dinner ready when she gets home.

70
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,451
That's true.

71
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,120
-I can't imagine him cooking.
-I can make poke.

72
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,454
-What?
-Poke.

73
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,664
-Poke?
-Poke.

74
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,208
-What's poke?
-It's a Hawaiian dish.

75
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,671
You cut albacore into cubes,

76
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,591
you dice them,
and mix it with sesame oil and soy sauce.

77
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,969
Sounds good.
Like a maguro-don.

78
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,431
-Yes, a poke-don.
-Sounds tasty.

79
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,015
It sounds cute, poke-don.

80
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,726
Maybe I'll surprise her.

81
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,686
-I'm sure she'll be happy.
-Yeah.

82
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,479
And I'm free tomorrow,
so I'll make it then.

83
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,647
-You're free tomorrow?
-Yeah.

84
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,399
When do you work?

85
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,777
-Nacchan said the same thing.
-What?

86
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,196
"Aren't you worried that you don't work?"

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,116
She said the same thing to Minori. Right?

88
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,784
Oh, she said it to Minori, too?

89
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,536
She's back.
Welcome back.

90
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,997
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,167
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

92
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,337
-Back from China?
-I'm back from China.

93
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,090
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

94
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,634
-It's been a while.
-It has!

95
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,762
I'm so tired!

96
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,057
Wow, you get to travel out of the country.
Did you say you're going to Okinawa, too?

97
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,601
Yeah, the day after tomorrow.

98
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,353
-The day after tomorrow?
-Oh, maybe the day after that.

99
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,107
-For how long?
-Three days, two nights.

100
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,692
You're never here.

101
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,361
-Never.
-You're so busy.

102
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,905
Yeah, really busy.

103
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,740
But you're off tomorrow?

104
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,493
-I'm off tomorrow.
-That's good.

105
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,246
I'm going to get some water.

106
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,588
It's so dirty.

107
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,966
Did no one clean?

108
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,100
Hey, guys.

109
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,311
It's a little messy in there, no?

110
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,438
-Is it?
-The kitchen's pretty bad.

111
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,648
We haven't cleaned.

112
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,775
We haven't cleaned.

113
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,569
Looks like udon.

114
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,112
-Udon?
-Did we eat udon?

115
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,990
Yeah, what Arisa made.

116
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,535
-We'll do it.
-We did eat it.

117
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,911
We'll do it.

118
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,121
Let's put in some effort.

119
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,291
Are you guys not bothered?

120
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,586
Yeah, we all tend to not be bothered.

121
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,923
-Yeah, whoever notices usually does it.
-We're all pretty laid back.

122
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,759
Let's just get the dishes done now.

123
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,512
-So impressive.
-Come on.

124
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,847
Doesn't it only take
one person to wash dishes?

125
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,474
-No, two.
-That's terrible!

126
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,767
You're terrible.

127
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,478
-I was kidding. Of course I'll help.
-Let's go.

128
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,064
Very commendable.

129
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,024
How unusual!

130
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,150
It's dirty!

131
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,152
See?

132
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,364
It is dirty.

133
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,826
Hikaru seems messy, too.

134
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,745
-Hikaru keeps using new cups.
-He does.

135
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,374
I only used one of those cups.

136
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,334
-That's a lie.
-It's true.

137
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,212
-It's for sure a lie.
-It's the truth.

138
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,009
I don't really know what you do yet.

139
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,721
And vice versa.
About each other's jobs.

140
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,848
Like how things are going.

141
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,435
You want to focus on just modeling?

142
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,314
Right now? Yeah.

143
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,317
Was I wrong?

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,861
-Was I wrong?
-No, that's what I want.

145
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,072
-And in the future?
-The future?

146
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,909
I want to live and work on a ranch.

147
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,788
Oh, so you want to do that
while modeling?

148
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,790
Yes, that's right.

149
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,584
That's what I want right now.

150
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,129
Why did you join <i>Terrace House?</i>

151
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,299
-Because it sounded fun.
-Oh.

152
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,136
And what's the reason you're still here?

153
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,013
My reason?

154
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,392
For me, January just happens to be busy.

155
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:20,815
If I was home all the time,
I'd think about why I'm here now.

156
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,525
In my case anyway.

157
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,152
You're saying that's me now?

158
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,404
Well... yeah.

159
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,950
Or, if I was in that situation.

160
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,578
I don't think there's anything wrong
with having free time,

161
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,539
or being home because of it.

162
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,376
Do you think about leaving?

163
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,752
-I do.
-No way.

164
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm leaving in February.

165
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,008
-What?
-That's my plan. The end of February.

166
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,343
-Really?
-Yeah.

167
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,303
What about your boyfriend?

168
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,263
He knows.

169
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,477
But I don't know what Uchi will be doing.

170
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,437
I'm sure you wouldn't like it if he stays.

171
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,398
-What?
-Your boyfriend.

172
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,901
I think it's up to Uchi to decide
when he wants to leave.

173
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,241
You're not a normal couple.

174
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,119
You're a curious couple.

175
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:19,416
Our situation is different,
but we're no different than anyone else.

176
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,505
I see.

183
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,271
Good morning.

184
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,773
Good morning.

185
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,194
-It's cold, isn't it?
-It's super cold.

186
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,949
-What are you doing today?
-Today?

187
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,993
Nothing really.

188
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,329
-I'm staying in.
-You are?

189
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,916
-But isn't the weather amazing today?
-Yeah.

190
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,584
I wonder if it's cold.

191
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,003
It looks cold.

192
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,172
Then let's go eat something delicious.

193
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,965
I haven't had Japanese food in a while.

194
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,301
-Sure.
-Something Japanese.

195
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,719
-Let's go.
-Let's go near the ocean.

196
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,055
-Near the ocean, and...
-Near the ocean?

197
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,474
-Maybe to Enoshima?
-Enoshima?

198
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,434
-In that direction.
-Okay.

199
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,067
-It's warm today.
-Yeah, it's great.

200
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,654
-It's great when men can drive well.
-Right?

201
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,994
It's amazing to be able to drive and talk.

202
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,704
Right?

203
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,459
Hey, so when you're free,
let's go to different places.

204
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,878
Sounds good.
You're going to be my guide?

205
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,463
-Sure.
-Okay, thanks.

206
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,467

Our Two Specialty Dons
Makanai-Don and Horohoro-Don

209
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,062
-It's pretty here.
-Yeah, it is.

210
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,524
It's great around sunset.

211
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,155
Sorry for the wait.
Here's the makanai-don, no wasabi.

212
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,323
-Wow!
-Excuse me.

213
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,284
Looks amazing.

214
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,578
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

215
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,753
-Delicious.
-It's delicious.

216
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,173
It's been a week, but you've only been
at <i>Terrace House</i> for two days.

217
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,134
-Yeah.
-Three days I mean.

218
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,177
How is it?

219
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,723
Of the girls, Arisa is easiest to talk to.

220
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,349
-Really?
-Yeah.

221
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,477
But out of everyone,
you're the easiest to talk to.

222
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,521
Seriously? I'm glad.

223
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,692
What about Minori?

224
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,902
Minori?

225
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,239
I guess it's just her personality.

226
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,033
Anything I say...

227
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,745
I think she takes offense to it.

228
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,830
-She's sensitive?
-Yeah.

229
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,833
She'll say, "What's wrong with that?"

230
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,711
I don't mean to hurt her.

231
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,130
But anyways...

232
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,382
I thought she might not like me.

233
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,470
-Everyone's pretty peaceful.
-Really?

234
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,096
We don't argue.

235
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,891
Most of the members
don't really talk, though.

236
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,101
That's true.
Maybe that's why.

237
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,273
Since I came, I've thought about
how everyone's so nice.

238
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,983
No one ever complains.

239
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,987
I wonder how they really feel.

240
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,658
It's nice we get along, and it's peaceful,
but that's all.

241
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,867
There's a wall.

242
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:28,748
You develop real friendships
after arguing, or more talks.

243
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:33,044
So I think it's good.
You bring a new vibe to the house.

244
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,005
-So...
-Yeah?

245
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,675
An honest question.

246
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,095
-Totally honest.
-What is it?

247
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,806
About Arisa...

248
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,934
Do you really like her?

249
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,144
Yeah, I do.

250
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,730
Really?

251
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,192
She works until midnight every day.

252
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,278
I don't want to bother her
by asking her on a date.

253
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,074
-So it's not like things are awkward.
-Awkward?

254
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,159
No, not anymore.

255
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,622
Do you like her a lot?
Or is it just interest right now?

256
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,625
-I like her.
-That much?

257
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,252
Yeah, kind of a lot.

258
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,421
I see.
What percentage?

259
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,551
Well, I just like her.
I don't know what percentage.

260
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,014
So you really like her.

261
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,975
I see.

262
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,271
I want to be in love, too.

263
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,940
-You do?
-I do!

264
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,027
I don't necessarily want to be
in a relationship.

265
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,737
Just in love.

266
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,572
Sounds good.

267
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,958
Will you pull it for me?

268
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,211
Hold on. Let me go first.

269
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,549
-It's cold.
-No way!

270
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,426
-It's true. Yeah.
-The sand?

271
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,095
Oh, how embarrassing!

272
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,390
Isn't that hard to put on
while laying down?

273
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,519
Wait, will you pull?

274
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,272
I can only do one thing.
I can either hold or pull.

275
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,651
Nice!
Thank you.

276
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,903
I like those socks.

277
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,490
Those are cute socks.

278
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,742
It's so cold!
-It's super cold.

279
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,577
-It's cold!
-Totally.

280
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,496
It's so pretty, though. Look.

281
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,665
Yeah, it's clear.

282
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,423
Nice.

283
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,052
Nice. I'm good at selfies.

284
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,814
-That was fun.
-Yeah.

285
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,237
Sparks are flying
between Minori and Natsumi.

286
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,116
At any moment, Minori could be like,

287
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,367
"What's your problem?"

288
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,702
There was that kind of tension.

289
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,623
-It's gone beyond the Kansai idea, though.
-That's true.

290
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:20,670
That wasn't quite
the general Kansai teasing.

291
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,756
No, the issue goes beyond that.

292
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,802
"If I was at home with nothing to do,
I might question myself..."

293
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,804
"You're talking about me?"
"Yeah."

294
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
Unbelievable!

295
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,309
-That's hard to say.
-Unbelievable!

296
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,686
If she was going to say it...

297
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,357
She said it herself;
she happens to be busy now.

298
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,944
But next month,
she'll have free time too.

299
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,364
So she should have prefaced it with,
"I'll be in the same situation."

300
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,326
-Yes.
-If she was going to say that to Minori.

301
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,413
-Is that an attack on her?
-I wonder.

302
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,250
I wondered if she just didn't notice
how Minori was taking it.

303
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,377
But she knew.
So that means...

304
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:07,592
maybe Natsumi's also annoyed
by Minori's reactions.

305
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,345
Like, "Why are you all worked up?"

306
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,515
It's a different crassness than Seina's.

307
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,808
-It's different.
-Yeah.

308
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,351
SEINA SHIMABUKURO

309
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,938
Seina's crassness was just stupidity
with no bad intentions.

310
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,940
Like a rampaging dog.

311
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,861
A rampaging dog knocking things over.

312
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,363
But this is a rampaging human.

313
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,407
Yeah, a person.

314
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,951
-A rampaging human.
-A rampaging human?

315
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:39,790
Maybe she's just
a little immature and spirited.

316
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,169
Yeah, she probably doesn't have
bad intentions.

317
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,880
There's that, too,

318
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,841
but also,
Arman apparently still likes Arisa.

319
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,218
That's true.

320
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,721
And the way Natsumi was questioning Arman.

321
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,892
"Do you like her?"
And he says, "Yeah."

322
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,771
And then, "How much?"
She really questions him.

323
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,483
And she says she wants to be in love, too.
She did invite him out.

324
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,070
How do you think Natsumi feels
about Arman?

325
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:14,283
Like, she's just playing with a big dog.

326
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,704
-She's a bit of a tomboy.
-I sense a bit of Heidi in her.

327
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:23,459
You mean the type
that innocently leads men on.

328
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,753
So she's a Heidi.

329
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,838
-Yeah, of Naniwa.
-Heidi of Naniwa.

330
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm sorry.

331
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,261
I hadn't made that connection.

332
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,066
How is it, chef?

333
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,362
-It's delicious.
-Is it?

334
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,825
-It's good.
-Right?

335
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,159
It's good.

336
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,288
Hi.

337
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,626
We're making Hawaiian food.

338
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,711
Poke-don?

339
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,921
-Poke-don?
-Yeah, Poke-don.

340
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,131
Ahi poke.

341
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,176
There might not be enough for everyone.
It's supposed to be for Arisa.

342
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,429
-You already had curry, right?
-We did.

343
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,681
You can try some of the ahi poke.

344
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,229
Okay.

345
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,940
-What?
-Nothing.

346
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,942
-What?
-It was nothing.

347
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:47,376
Hey, Arman, let's go chat.

348
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,836
What?

349
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,798
-Let's chat.
-What?

350
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,849
What's going on?

351
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,810
-What is it?
-I don't know.

352
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,688
How scary!

353
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,523
What'd you do today?

354
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,317
I went to Shonan.

355
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,569
By yourself?

356
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,738
Of course not!
With Arman.

357
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,031
Why?

358
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,825
-What do you mean?
-For fun?

359
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,913
-Are you mad?
-What? Why?

360
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,124
What? What's going on?

361
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,336
It's just sudden.
I wondered if you made plans long before.

362
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,296
-What? Sudden?
-What?

363
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,175
What did you do in Shonan?

364
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,554
So many questions.

365
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,264
What?

366
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,851
Did you wonder where we went?

367
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,688
I didn't know you guys went out.

368
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:53,317
Did everyone share that stuff before?

369
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,570
Everyone usually knew...

370
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,407
I think we usually knew.

371
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,992
-We only decided this morning.
-What?

372
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:08,708
We only just decided this morning,
so there wasn't time to say anything.

373
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,548
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

374
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:24,348
If you need me to report anything,
just let me know.

375
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,434
I've never needed that.

376
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,856
It just sounds like you're mad at me.

377
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:38,279
Like, "How could you just go?"
Like, "Why wouldn't you tell anyone?"

378
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:46,620
And here we are just cooking
and trying to have dinner,

379
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,874
and you guys come in and call him out.

380
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,170
Why can't they just talk here?

381
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,838
-I'm sorry?
-What?

382
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,423
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's not it.

383
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,176
It's nothing to apologize for.

384
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,987
-What was going on there?
-You mean being in the kitchen together?

385
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,283
If it's what we talked about yesterday,

386
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:30,164
I though poke-don was something
you would make for Arisa.

387
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,459
I just figured she could help
if I'm making poke,

388
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
and we'd make it together.

389
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,380
You didn't tell her
you were making it for Arisa?

390
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,468
Like, the idea why you're making it?

391
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,470
Well, no.

392
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,681
If you don't tell her,
it's like there's something going on.

393
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:51,727
Instead of,
"Hey, I made this with Nacchan,"

394
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:57,733
she'll be happier
if it's completely from you.

395
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,570
She said she'd help,
and we're roommates.

396
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,489
She didn't do anything wrong.

397
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,407
I don't mean she did.

398
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,245
I don't think it's anything
to have a serious talk over.

399
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,583
Sorry for the wait.

400
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,131
-It's done already?
-Not yet.

401
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,300
-The poke, I mean.
-Oh, the poke.

402
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,803
-The color changed.
-Yeah.

403
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,305
It looks a little grotesque.

404
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,934
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

405
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,105
-Sorry it's gotten complicated.
-What?

406
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,816
-It's gotten complicated.
-It's okay.

407
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,695
I said I was going to make it
for Arisa yesterday.

408
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,406
So he asked why we're making it together,

409
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:50,578
and he said that she'd probably be happier
if I made it myself.

410
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,915
And that might be true,
but you offered to help.

411
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,625
From now on...

412
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:02,047
when I go somewhere with you,

413
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,676
-I'll tell Arisa.
-Sure.

414
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,679
But what's the point of telling
Uchi and Minori?

415
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,723
It doesn't concern them.

416
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,767
I don't know why they're so worried.

417
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,312
It was delicious.

418
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,107
I'm really sorry it's gotten complicated.

419
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,318
It's not your fault.

420
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,873
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

421
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,960
-Did you have dinner already?
-I did.

422
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,754
-I thought maybe you hadn't.
-Really?

423
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,339
Can you still eat?

424
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,591
I'm sorry. I ate some bread while working.

425
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,510
There's some Hawaiian poke...

426
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,095
that I made.

427
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,680
You made it?

428
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,683
I'm sorry. I'll have some then.

429
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,186
Just a little.

430
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,647
-I'm so happy.
-Want something to drink?

431
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,857
-Yeah, some water.
-Water?

432
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,817
-Here.
-Thanks.

433
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:07,196
-It's very thoughtful of you.
-It's nothing.

434
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,198
You seem so busy.

435
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,242
I've never had this before.

436
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,080
-How is it?
-It's delicious.

437
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,164
-Is it?
-Yeah.

438
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,957
Nacchan helped, too.

439
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,420
How're things going?

440
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,798
I'm busy with work.

441
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,551
If there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

442
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,638
-Like physical labor.
-Physical labor?

443
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,473
-Physical labor...
-None?

444
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,058
I'll let you know.

445
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,355
I asked why they went out today.

446
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,941
Then she asked if I was mad.

447
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:49,738
Yesterday we were talking about work, too.

448
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,076
I wonder why she's combative towards me.

449
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,579
Can't you tell her?

450
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:03,043
Even if I do, I feel like
she's not trying to understand.

451
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:07,589
It's like, "Why are you like that?
Why are you like that, Minori?"

452
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,927
And just now,
she said something like,

453
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,306
"If you say it like that,
it doesn't make me feel good."

454
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:23,397
I don't know if I can live with her.

455
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,524
It's hard.

456
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,238
Should I talk to her?

457
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,948
To Nacchan?

458
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,168
-That was quite a scene.
-Lots of sparks flying.

459
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,628
-Surprising.
-There were a lot of "what"s.

460
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,465
-What?
-What? What?

461
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,051
Here it is.
The stress is here.

462
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,266
This is what they mean when they say,
they just don't mesh.

463
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,392
They just don't mesh.

464
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,728
I'm sure it was annoying for her

465
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,731
to see her unhappy expression
and yet not clearly saying anything.

466
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,401
It's really easy to see
how conflicts occur.

467
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,112
It's like these earphones.

468
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,157
You put them in your bag,
and they get tangled.

469
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,241
Yes.

470
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,161
I feel like I just saw
how they get tangled.

471
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,371
I see.

472
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,373
I see.

473
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:28,128
I don't really think either are at fault.

474
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,756
It's just a difference in personality.

475
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,595
But when Natsumi helped Arman,
Uchi said, "That's not good."

476
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,515
Why are you nit-picking her actions?

477
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,351
You're a man.
There's no need for that.

478
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:47,272
-It's so nit-picky!
-He pulled him aside and everything.

479
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,191
I'd understand if it was a girl.

480
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,486
I'd get it if it was
Minori's or Arisa's friend.

481
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,197
But he's a man!
He shouldn't get involved.

482
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,535
He'd listened to Minori's complaints.
Maybe he just felt like he needed to help.

483
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,995
He probably has to hear it all the time.

484
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,332
I bet the Japanese-style room is hell
just until he sleeps.

485
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,834
After getting home from work.

486
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,837
Yes, having to listen to
"This is what she said today,

487
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,714
and she made this kind of face,"
and on and on...

488
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,261
It's bad luck that they happen to be
at <i>Terrace House</i> at the same time.

489
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,513
It's bad timing.

490
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,225
Maybe we'll get to see
how to resolve issues like these.

491
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,686
If it can be resolved.

492
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,271
Let's have a house meeting today.

493
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:32,401
So what happened was,
when the two of us were cooking,

494
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,489
Uchi suddenly pulled Arman away.

495
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,241
Out of the room.

496
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,411
And Minori sat here.

497
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,623
I didn't really like
the way Minori was talking to me.

498
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,417
Her tone...

499
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:52,963
Minori denied it,
saying that was not how she meant it.

500
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,757
-That's when things got a little...
-I see.

501
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,467
There was a little argument.

502
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,180
But we didn't want things to be awkward.

503
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,724
That's how this started.

504
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:10,272
But what Uchi did in that moment
wasn't very good.

505
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,149
Why?

506
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,862
First of all, I didn't know
he was making it for Arisa.

507
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,990
-That's true.
-Yeah.

508
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,201
-So Arman was making it for Arisa?
-Yeah.

509
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,246
Either way,
you could've just said it here.

510
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,874
I was thinking of you at that point.

511
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:34,296
In case you didn't know Arman liked Arisa.

512
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,674
-I didn't want you to feel--
-But that's just an assumption.

513
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,177
-Assumption?
-Your own assumption.

514
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,056
You assumed
that I have feelings for Arman.

515
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,142
-That's why you did what you did.
-That's right.

516
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,394
-I assumed--
-But if that's not true--

517
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,105
And what if it was true?

518
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:57,653
If you make assumptions,
then while we were just cooking together

519
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,571
as normal roommates, I--

520
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,865
Let's say my assumptions are right--

521
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,534
You don't know that.
You have no right.

522
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,704
So it was just a matter of Arman
not explaining well enough.

523
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,123
So it's Arman's fault?

524
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:14,336
Not his fault, but yesterday...

525
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,506
So it was all just a misunderstanding.

526
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,008
Yeah, I get both sides.

527
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,179
So he told you why, right?

528
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,684
That he likes Arisa,
and as a roommate, you'd help.

529
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,477
You had that conversation, right?

530
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,188
What do you mean?
No, we didn't.

531
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:38,068
-I didn't tell her the meal was for Arisa.
-No.

532
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:42,155
But earlier, we talked about Arisa.

533
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,076
And I told her I liked her.

534
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,163
But no, I didn't say
the meal was for Arisa.

535
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,834
Can I explain my thoughts?

536
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:59,548
Coming home, I saw you guys
cooking together and thought, "What?"

537
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,135
-That's where I felt that--
-I got that.

538
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,430
The moment you came in,
you both gave me weird looks.

539
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,516
And it made me uncomfortable.

540
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,437
-I thought, "Why look at me like that?"
-It was my fault for not explaining.

541
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,482
And I talked to Arman and found out

542
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,527
that it was just as roommates,
so it was fine.

543
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:25,490
But if it wasn't,
and it was just you guys cooking together,

544
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,284
then I felt it was wrong,
so I pulled Arman aside.

545
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,412
So it was on behalf of Arisa.

546
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,916
But did you consider
how I'd feel by doing that?

547
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,171
Did I consider? Well, I...

548
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,214
We were just cooking,

549
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,385
and you guys came
and suddenly pulled aside Arman.

550
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:51,224
And then you guys disappeared,
and Minori started interrogating me.

551
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,311
"Where'd you go today? Why?
Why would you do that?"

552
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,646
That's what it sounded like to me.

553
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,317
-If someone does that to you--
-I do feel bad about that.

554
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,112
I think I didn't word it well.

555
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:08,700
I honestly didn't know
what Uchi was going to say to Arman.

556
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,660
We weren't trying to gang up on you.

557
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,373
But the tone of voice is revealing.

558
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:19,461
I think what came out
stemmed from our previous talks

559
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,673
when you asked me why I liked Uchi.

560
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:29,096
You said things like
how we're a strange couple.

561
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,057
That really made me feel bad.

562
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,769
You tend to be... pretty blunt.

563
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:41,358
So that was me just honestly asking.

564
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,778
But you kept taking it as criticism.

565
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:49,491
So what happened in the kitchen
is the flip of that.

566
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,620
Yeah, you didn't consider
Minori's feelings.

567
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,249
Just like you asked
whether I considered your feelings.

568
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,461
Have you considered Minori's feelings?

569
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,840
Is it just all about how we look at it?

570
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,592
There's that too,

571
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:13,265
and the way I said things in the kitchen,
as well as how you've said things.

572
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,809
We're here because of all of that.

573
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,357
You've just misunderstood each other.

574
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,277
I didn't explain well enough either.

575
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,613
So let's not let this happen again.

576
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,741
Let's all do our best
to not let it happen again.

577
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,161
It's inevitable.

578
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,830
Cheers!

579
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,625
If you brush it off like that,

580
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,420
the friendship
will always remain superficial.
