1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,767
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,435
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,146
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,318
There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,988
A lot happened last week.

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,865
No one saw it coming.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,450
It was shocking.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:40,290
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,922
Will you be my girlfriend?

12
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,676
Family? Brother? Like friends...

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,262
The more we hung out,

14
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,806
the more my feelings tilted that way,
I guess.

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:02,521
Earlier, both Tokui and I said
some things about Arisa...

16
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:06,900
But neither of us can really say anything
about anyone else.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,281
Why not? You guys are right.
She led him on.

18
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,783
Holding his hand and everything.
It's not right.

19
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,577
I'd hold hands.

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,455
-I wouldn't be able to help it.
-That's right.

21
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,457
-That's not true, right, Triendl?
-I wouldn't hold hands!

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,459
Right? It's Christmas.

23
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,296
No. It's Christmas.
I wouldn't hold his hand!

24
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,422
What about you, Kentaro?

25
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,840
-I wouldn't hold hands.
-See?

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,466
-That's right.
-That's how it should be.

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,845
And even if I did...
Let's say I did.

28
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,973
Afterwards, when everyone was telling me
how my actions were misleading,

29
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,725
I wouldn't cry.

30
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,270
No way.

31
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,397
I definitely wouldn't cry.

32
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,527
She's the guardian of tears.

33
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,945
I...

34
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:59,077
I'm not ready for a relationship now,
but it's not that I don't like...

35
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,872
So, you don't think of me as a sibling?

36
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,250
I do want to get to know you...

37
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,835
better.

38
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,337
I understand.

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,132
And we have new members.

40
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,760
Beautiful ones, at that.

41
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,012
I model and act.

42
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,347
HIKARU OTA, 18 YEARS OLD

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,392
And I do construction on the side.

44
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,727
What's your type?

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,145
Mature.

46
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,939
Well, I've only dated older women.

47
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,360
He's half-Italian.
Of course he's popular with the ladies.

48
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,738
-Italy, right?
-Yes, Italy.

49
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,074
-The country of love.
-Yes.

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,450
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD

51
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,203
Do people have real relationships here?

52
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,623
-Yeah.
-Watching it on TV...

53
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,293
I was wondering if you really
fall for each other.

54
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>-Cute.</i>
<i>-She's cute.</i>

55
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,130
Natsumi seems like
a daytime soap opera character.

56
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,298
She does.

57
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,425
Like a heroine from
the inspirational drama.

58
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,552
-She does.
-That sense of purity.

59
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,013
If you line their pictures up,

60
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,058
it's like the start of a new drama.
<i>Opposing Poles.</i>

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,728
In another country?

62
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,064
Perhaps we need another meeting
to come up with a better title.

63
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,983
How about, <i>Opposite Poles?</i>

64
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,572
Do you usually cook at home?

65
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,575
Yes, I like to cook.

66
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,327
You don't eat out very often?

67
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,665
-I'll go if I'm invited...
-Want to help?

68
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,209
-The cucumbers?
-But I really enjoy cooking.

69
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,169
-I can do that.
-That's good.

70
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,089
-Let's cook together.
-Yeah...

71
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,007
-while having a drink.
-Great idea!

72
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,968
I want a drink now.

73
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,471
It's ready.

74
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,973
Looks delicious.

75
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,474
Welcome to <i>Terrace House.</i>

76
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,561
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

77
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,073
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

78
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,331
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

79
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,875
What?

80
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,794
Nice to meet you.

81
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,172
-I'm Uchihara.
-I'm Natsumi.

82
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,049
-Nice to meet you.
-I was so surprised.

83
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,094
I thought I possibly came
to the wrong house.

84
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,018
That's so nice.
Like you're in a relationship.

85
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,438
-What is? Now?
-Your back and forth.

86
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,774
Oh, you know already.
You watched the show?

87
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,650
I saw a little bit on TV.

88
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,780
Did they already ask you
why you came here?

89
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,158
I just thought it seemed like fun.

90
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,077
That's good enough.
Fun is reason enough.

91
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,623
-There's no one to be irritated.
-There was someone who used to get upset.

92
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,334
-What do you mean? A member?
-Yeah, one of the members would say

93
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,004
"Why are you alive
if you don't have a purpose?"

94
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,255
I might have seen that part.

95
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,299
He was strict
when it came to pursuing dreams.

96
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,885
Do you two have dreams for the future?

97
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,389
Well, you know how I model and act?

98
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,892
I want to make it to the top.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,812
Especially with my acting.

100
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,148
I want to be an actress.

101
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,068
-Oh, I see.
-I want to act.

102
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,321
What about languages?
How many languages can you speak?

103
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,284
A little bit of Italian.
I'm fluent in Portuguese.

104
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,870
I can understand English.

105
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,958
So if Arman spoke in English,
I can answer in Japanese.

106
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,709
You seem like the shy type.

107
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,045
Not at all.

108
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,508
It's nice to hear her talk
and to hear the Kansai accent.

109
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,635
Arisa has an accent, too.

110
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,930
-Accents are hot.
-Yeah.

111
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,849
We should have this conversation
with just the guys.

112
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,184
-You can do that later.
-We will.

113
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,769
Accents are nice, though.

114
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,564
When they say "Can you help me?"
with the accent...

115
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,316
-It sounds so good.
-Yeah, I wanna be told "Why not?"

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,403
Stop.
Now it's hard for me to talk.

117
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,905
Do you have a boyfriend?

118
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,782
I don't.

119
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,743
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-He doesn't.

120
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,328
I don't.

121
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,581
-You must be popular with the girls.
-Not at all.

122
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,458
You seem like you'd be popular
with 40-somethings who'd say you're cute!

123
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:20,630
-Oh, yeah!
-Well, I've only dated older women.

124
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,342
-What's the oldest you've dated?
-Thirty-six.

125
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,636
And how old were you then?

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,057
It was a year ago, so I was 17.

127
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,476
But what's your type?
Did you ask already?

128
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,437
-Yeah.
-What was it?

129
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,522
Someone manly.

130
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,899
-These two guys are manly.
-Yeah.

131
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:44,821
What do you mean, "Yeah"?
I don't want to be told that most.

132
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,158
-You're kind of girlie.
-I see.

133
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,828
-This is a little awkward.
-It is.

134
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,164
-She's tough on me.
-That's probably best.

135
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,209
-We're both tough on each other.
-I'm super sweet.

136
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,670
On the flip side,
as weird as that sounds,

137
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,714
what do you like about him?

138
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,133
She won't be able to answer that.

139
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,968
I'm still thinking about it.

140
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,304
Thinking about it?

141
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,097
That must be a shock to you.

142
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,974
-There are lots of things.
-Don't say.

143
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,269
But don't ask me here.
I'll tell you later.

144
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,731
Is your week packed with work?

145
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,734
January is pretty busy for me.

146
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,653
I have to leave for China
the day after tomorrow.

147
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,071
-China?
-What? China?

148
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,197
Yeah.

149
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,366
-What for? Work?
-Yeah, for work.

150
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,409
-For a week?
-Four days.

151
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,577
I see.

152
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,038
-So you're here, then you're gone.
-Yeah.

153
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,539
That's true.

154
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,459
-I used it.
-You did already?

155
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,670
-Okay.
-Yay!

156
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,840
Oh, you're done?

157
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,259
Then it's just you.
So we're done.

158
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,886
-So we're done.
-We're done.

159
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,262
Wait, why?

160
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,723
When the poorest becomes the wealthiest,
The game is over. God's promotion.

161
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,183
-What's that?
-I see.

162
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,601
Oh, Arisa's back.

163
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,062
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

164
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,108
Wow. Two?

165
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,611
-It's nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

166
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,989
-I'm Natsumi Saito.
-I'm Arisa Ohata.

167
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,324
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

168
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,034
-Oh, he stood up.
-Nice to meet you.

169
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,828
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm Hikaru Ota.

170
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,329
-Sorry?
-I'm Hikaru Ota.

171
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,498
Hikaru Ota?
I'm Arisa Ohata.

172
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,583
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

173
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,752

174
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,546
To our meeting.

175
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,839
Cheers!

176
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,134
Cheers!

183
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,846
You two are a couple, right?

184
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,140
Are you guys?

185
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,100
-No.
-No, we're not.

186
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,228
-Not a couple.
-No, not a couple.

187
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,898
But sort of?

188
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,983
Well, we went on a few dates.

189
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,448
She's a hat designer.

190
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,866
-Hats?
-Yes.

191
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,493
So you could make a hat for me?

192
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,911
-A hat?
-If you ask, she will.

193
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,954
-For real?
-Yes.

194
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,124
-You're starting your own brand, right?
-Starting?

195
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,711
Yes, I'm planning
an exhibition for February.

196
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,837
Wow.

197
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,589
-It's coming up.
-Yeah.

198
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,424
Is everyone tired of cards?

199
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,719
Should we watch something downstairs?

200
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,096
-In the game room?
-Yeah.

201
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,972
What's the game room?

202
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,349
Oh, you haven't seen it yet?

203
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,893
-You haven't seen it?
-Why don't you show her?

204
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,146
-You should take her.
-Okay.

205
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,901
Let's take these.

206
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,157
-What's the game room?
-So...

207
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,535
The game room?
You'll see.

208
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,702
What do you think?

209
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,664
-You'll see.
-I'll know when I see it?

210
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,834
It's... interesting.

211
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,252
Isn't it?

212
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,088
He's good-looking, isn't he?

213
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,298
-Definitely.
-Yeah.

214
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,717
He has the quality of a model.

215
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,387
You should ask her about her type.

216
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,557
-What's your type?
-Someone who can survive on an island.

217
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,724
On an island?

218
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,562
-Not you?
-No, that's totally me.

219
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,690
He's in construction.
He can build you a house.

220
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,775
By that, do you mean the wild?

221
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,864
Someone who could start anew,
even if he lost everything.

222
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,496
This is the game room.

223
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,042
There are games and Netflix.

224
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,172
-So this is where you watch the show.
-Yeah, we watch it together.

225
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,383
Is it different than how you imagined?

226
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,261
Everyone is...

227
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,639
more reserved than I imagined.

228
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,558
It'll get better once things settle.

229
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,685
I think we're all nervous
because you're new.

230
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,688
That's why we're like that.

231
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm sure it'll be fun.

232
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,735
We can drink together.

233
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,113
That's true.
We do seem to have that in common.

234
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,323
Yeah.

235
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,868
Have you gone out anywhere recently?

236
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,245
To Kamakura.

237
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,789
-Do you like the ocean?
-I love the ocean.

238
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,583
Me, too.

239
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,585
Do you know Japanese beaches well?

240
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,629
Not at all.

241
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,716
Then let's explore Japanese beaches.

242
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,884
That'll be nice.

243
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,677
Let's take the car out.

244
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,307
-Whenever you have time.
-Sure, I'm usually free.

245
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,979
What's the oldest you're willing to date?

246
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,273
Forty-five.

247
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,067
You're into the cute type?

248
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,110
More the cool type.

249
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,531
-The cool beauty? That's Arisa.
-Yeah.

250
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,118
-Definitely not.
-Definitely not.

251
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,122
-She does give a mature impression.
-Yes.

252
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,125
-Really?
-Well, the first impression anyway.

253
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,377
-First impression?
-Yeah.

254
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,420
And Natsumi?

255
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,966
I noticed she's pretty forward.

256
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,760
I thought so, too.
You too, right?

257
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,346
When Arman said he would take her
to the game room.

258
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,725
She said, "Let's take these,"
and grabbed Arman's whiskey.

259
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,477
She did grab his whiskey.

260
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,231
So, I guess, based on first impression,
Arman is her type.

261
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775
You look like you want to say something.

262
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,528
I haven't said anything.
I was just thinking, "Ah, I see."

263
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,947
-How are things with Arman?
-With Arman?

264
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,950
After cleaning up together, we made up.

265
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,288
Since then, we only exchanged
Happy New Year greetings.

266
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,915
-By text?
-Yeah.

267
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,505
The mood was so languid in <i>Terrace House.</i>

268
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,549
Because of Natsumi's tone.
Like the way she says,

269
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,386
"Really?"
Or, "What's a game room?"

270
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,221
That languid tone permeated.

271
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,975
Natsumi is in control.

272
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,563
It's a little scary, isn't it,
and how perfectly she carries herself?

273
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,233
She'll definitely be able to capture
a guy's heart.

274
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,860
-Oh, definitely.
-Definitely.

275
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,613
-She's unexpectedly forward.
-Yes, it was surprising.

276
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,824
Arman is apparently desirable.

277
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,995
-No, that's not it.
-No, no...

278
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,248
-What? What?
-See, that's not it.

279
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,210
-She's not making a move on Arman.
-She was!

280
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,129
For Natsumi,

281
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,507
she was just asking,
"Where's the game room?"

282
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,760
"Let's take these."
And she took the drinks...

283
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,972
That was really just a light jab.

284
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,017
-Actually, not even a jab.
-No way!

285
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,519
When she said she didn't know
beaches in Japan well either,

286
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,729
I thought it would end there.

287
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,647
But she said,
"Let's explore them together."

288
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,816
If it were me, I'd think she liked me.

289
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,402
No, no. And the way she said it,

290
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,863
"Let's discover them together then."

291
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,658
We're going to get this every week now.

292
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:32,163
Are you going to do Natsumi's line
in that tone every time?

293
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,665
-I want to recreate that tone.
-He wants to do it.

294
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,878
-I see.
-So the way she asks

295
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,005
won't make people feel bad.

296
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,967
And in fact, they could get to know
each other and make friends in this way.

297
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,762
From Natsumi's point of view,
that's all it is.

298
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,764
You're right. I see.

299
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,726
But now that there's someone
from Kansai in <i>Terrace House,</i>

300
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,978
we'll get to hear, "Why not?"

301
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,647
"I love you."

302
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,274
-Oh, you mean we'll get to hear...
-"Forgive me."

303
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,653
"I can't stand it any longer."

304
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,239
We may get to hear those lines
in Kansai dialect.

305
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,865
What situations are you imagining?

306
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,827
The Japanese-style room, of course.

307
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,748
She'll like someone so much and say,
"I can't stand it any longer."

308
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,710
-We might get to hear it.
-You're right.

309
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,672
"I've overcooked the sprouts!"

310
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,966
-We might get to hear that.
-We just might.

311
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,136
She might say it,
but the staff might edit that one out.

312
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,807
And Hikaru is sort of...

313
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,353
-He seems into Arisa.
-It seems like he'll make a move on her.

314
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,066
This month, I'll be a shut-in.
Or what's the word?

315
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,360
You're stuck inside?

316
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,530
I have so much work.

317
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,739
It's crazy.

318
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,742
But isn't it better to stay busy?

319
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,035
-Yeah, it's fun.
-Right?

320
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,331
You have unnecessary thoughts
when you have too much free time.

321
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,500
I love having free time.

322
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,756
I can live forever doing nothing.

323
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,926
Having time off as a student

324
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,680
and having time off while working
are pretty different, aren't they?

325
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,349
Age definitely makes a difference.

326
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,436
Every year, I realize
how long I've been in Tokyo,

327
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,730
and I panic.

328
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,109
Makes me think, "What am I doing?"

329
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,281
Oh, so, what do you like about him?

330
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,118
-Oh, we're continuing that?
-I just remembered.

331
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,078
-Uchi?
-Yeah.

332
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,831
She wouldn't clearly say.

333
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,584
They kept putting each other down.

334
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,003
I've never seen a couple like that.

335
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,423
He's your boyfriend,
but I felt some distance between you.

336
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,218
They're different from a normal couple,

337
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,638
but I just figured
that's just Minori and Uchi.

338
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,599
Is it different when you two are alone?

339
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,143
-It's the same.
-Really?

340
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,188
For example, I'm really obvious.

341
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,148
I'm always touching my boyfriends.

342
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,609
-Really?
-Yeah.

343
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:11,989
To an outside observer,
we'd look like a lovey-dovey couple.

344
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,536
It's easy to imagine
a couple like that kissing.

345
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,706
But couples
that are always making fun of each other,

346
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,959
I don't really understand.

347
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,921
It's harder to imagine them kissing.

348
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,800
-Do you have to be able to imagine it?
-No, but...

349
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,054
They just don't give
that impression in public, I think.

350
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,978
-That's...
-You laugh, but it's true!

351
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,689
You guys are probably
just complete opposites.

352
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,108
Total opposites.

353
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,406
-I'm so tired today.
-It's tough to get used to.

354
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,408
It's hard.

355
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,909
Feel like you'll fit in?

356
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,996
No one seems like a bad person.

357
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,541
If you were to pick now,
which girl would be your type?

358
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,085
-By their face? Their looks?
-By looks.

359
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,545
By looks?

360
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,047
I think Arisa is cute.

361
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:15,136
-I see. Arisa.
-If we're going by looks, she's my type.

362
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,555
We'll see what happens.

363
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,933
What did you guys talk about
in the game room?

364
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:26,022
We both like the ocean,
so... she suggested we go to the beach.

365
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,649
She asked?

366
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,986
That's exactly what happened with Arisa!

367
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,904
I can't believe it.

368
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,073
-She works fast.
-So you're going to the beach?

369
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,742
I guess so.

370
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,704
What happens to you?

371
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,875
I lose my words with people I like.

372
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,795
-You make them like you?
-How do you mean?

373
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,425
-I wish I could make them like me.
-You seem like you do it unconsciously.

374
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,093
Me?

375
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,346
Do I?

376
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,473
Is there someone
you'd like to be with right now?

377
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,266
No.

378
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,103
But...

379
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,816
there is someone I have fun with.

380
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,403
Well, it could only be one person.

381
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,156
Yeah, I have fun with him.

382
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,450
-Do you think you'll fall for him?
-Hmm?

383
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,701
Do you think you'll fall for him?

384
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,245
Wow!

385
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,624
So many questions!

386
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:31,212
I'm going to be living here.
Of course I'd want to know!

387
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,882
What about you?

388
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,551
I felt like everyone was reserved.

389
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,721
-Today was more energetic than usual.
-No way!

390
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,140
I was more energetic than usual.

391
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,892
It was fun today.

392
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,104
I'm glad you're here.
You bring fun energy.

393
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,124
Wow. You set up the room?

394
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,418
It's cold.

395
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,839
-You want to sleep here?
-You don't want to sleep downstairs?

396
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:20,970
I wasn't sure since there's a new guy.

397
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,682
-Did you girls talk?
-Yeah, we talked.

398
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,602
-She's scary.
-Scary? How come?

399
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,688
She immediately asked.

400
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,275
-About what?
-How things are with us.

401
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,528
You know how she asked
what I liked about you earlier?

402
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,280
She asked me again.

403
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,949
She said all we did was
to make fun of each other.

404
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,909
She said it's weird.

405
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:49,457
She asked about when we're alone,
and I told her we're the same.

406
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,168
Then she asked if we're okay.

407
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,878
We're okay.

408
00:20:53,961 --> 00:21:00,050
She made it sound like
there was something wrong with us.

409
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,470
That seems rude.

410
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:07,224
She wouldn't let it go.
I was a little ticked.

411
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,025
-There might be a conflict.
-She totally says what's on her mind.

412
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,610
Yeah, she seems like she does.

413
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,780
Like she can't accept people
that are different from her.

414
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,532
-I got a little of that from her.
-Then she's like me.

415
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,242
-Will you be okay?
-I don't know.

416
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,077
Will you be able to get along?

HISATO KOJIMA, OWNER

430
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,624
Good morning. I'm Arman Bitaraf
I'll be starting with you today.

431
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,252
We're building the yard today.

432
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,046
We just laid out the stones.

433
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,843
We also finished the deck and pagoda.

434
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,346
And we're working on the fence.

435
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,142
Inside there will be a garden.

436
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:19,023
I'm thinking of having you help
fill the garden with dirt.

437
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,247
Hey, it's sort of sinking here.

438
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,666
So let's fill it with more dirt.

439
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,650
Let's take a break.

440
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,737
None of the members
who worked at Loco Mart

441
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,155
got a girl on the show.

442
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,282
-Total failure.
-Really?

443
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,118
-Was it the Kagoshima girl?
-Yes.

444
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,580
Apparently, she's really cute.

445
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,668
-Everyone's cute, though.
-That's true.

446
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,672
I guess we should all watch the show.

447
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,592
-I'll bring her to Kanagawa for a date.
-Nice.

448
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,804
I'd better dress up for that.

449
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:37,726
I guess things like that happen...

450
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,562
-between girls from Kansai and Kanto...
-Oh, yeah.

451
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,900
As a person from Kansai, if I may say,
she wasn't judging her or anything.

452
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,069
-Yeah, it was just normal communication.
-Really?

453
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:51,699
Yeah. She was just being friendly.
Sort of teasing her, saying,

454
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,450
"Are you really okay?

455
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:57,121
You guys are so weird,
always making fun of each other."

456
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,290
And then Minori's supposed to respond,

457
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,376
"Of course it's fine."

458
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,671
It was supposed to be a fun exchange.

459
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,215
Did you see Minori's expression?

460
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,763
I wouldn't want anyone to say that
about my relationship either.

461
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,931
I suppose.

462
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:20,394
The Kansai audience watching this
are all saying,

463
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,230
"But that's just making conversation!"

464
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,440
-For sure.
-Right?

465
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,527
-Girls would say, "It's just girl talk!"
-Definitely.

466
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,279
It's so tough.

467
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,365
-It's because they just met.
-Yeah.

468
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:38,162
It was a bad idea to try and be
so personal when they had just met.

469
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,623
It kind of had an edge, didn't it?

470
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,376
-That's how it's interpreted.
-I guess so.

471
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,628
-It's Scissorhands.
-That's true.

472
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,758
She's trying to give them a hug,
but she's got blades.

473
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,093
-It's bittersweet.
-It is.

474
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,638
-It's the Scissorhands of Naniwa.
-The Scissorhands of Naniwa?

475
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,682
-Natsumi Saito.
-It should be her nickname.

476
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,393
Like, "Hi, I'm Johnny Depp"?

477
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,563
Wrong sex.

478
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,818
So actually, everyone at <i>Terrace House</i>
up till now has been fairly quiet.

479
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,488
They've never really had a talker before.

480
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,073
It's the first time.

481
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,160
A beautiful Kansai girl.

482
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,162
She could make things complicated.

483
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,706
She may be your typical Osaka personality.

484
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,459
It's actually Seiji, the comedian,
in disguise.

485
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,586
SEIJI CHIHARA

486
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,379
If that's the case, it'll be complicated.

487
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,923
Crass?

488
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,299
-Complicated.
-Complicated.

489
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,511
It definitely turned Minori off.

490
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:40,349
And after this encounter,
Natsumi left for China for work.

491
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,060
Hopefully, there won't be
some strange meetings.

492
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,814
Yeah, a trial in absentia.
The trial in absentia from hell.

493
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,857
"Those Kansai people..."

494
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,444
"Oh, look, the takoyaki came back."

495
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,322
Oh, they could make jokes!

496
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,534
"The wheels on your luggage,
are they actually takoyaki?"

497
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,703
It would be refreshing
if they could say that.

498
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,248
We're worried because they can't.

499
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,250
You Kansai people can do that.

500
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,846
No one's home?

501
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,476
Didn't Nacchan say she's going to China?

502
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,686
Yeah, she left.

503
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,563
-She left today?
-Yeah, this morning.

504
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,567
-What time?
-I don't know. Pretty early.

505
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,986
-Before I left?
-Way before.

506
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,487
I didn't notice.

507
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,324
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

508
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,743
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

509
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,288
Was she at work?

510
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,707
-I guess she was at work.
-Yeah.

511
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,006
-You're not joining us?
-What?

512
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,591
-You're not joining us?
-Later.

513
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,842
Okay.

514
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,389
She seems tired.

515
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,350
-We should talk more though.
-Yeah.

516
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,024
Are you drinking?

517
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,275
-No.
-Yes.

518
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,484
-You're drinking?
-Yeah.

519
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,154
-You are?
-Yeah.

520
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,990
-Do you want a drink?
-No, not today.

521
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,075
-Work?
-There's that,

522
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,828
but I also wanted to make udon for dinner.

523
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,831
-Right now?
-I haven't eaten yet.

524
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,792
And Minori said she hasn't eaten either.

525
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,921
Did you know Minori caught a cold?

526
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,007
Yeah, she looked like she was dying.

527
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,508
Does it look bad?

528
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:42,304
Her fever's gone down,
but she said her stomach hurts.

529
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,889
Her stomach?
Is she okay?

530
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,935
I think it's
because she hasn't eaten any carbs.

531
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,479
-She went to the hospital?
-Yesterday.

532
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,275
How are things?
We didn't talk over the break.

533
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,989
-Recently?
-Do you have your hands full with work?

534
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,910
Since the new year began,
all I've done is work.

535
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,373
I don't think I'll have time off.

536
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,793
You work every day? No breaks?

537
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,880
Vendors are off, so I could rest, but...

538
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:20,384
You don't have set breaks?
Like on weekends?

539
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,137
I could if I wanted to.

540
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,432
But I have way too much to do.

541
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,728
I have things I need to finish this week.

542
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,232
Do you guys want some udon?

543
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,818
I don't.
You must be hungry.

544
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,738
-Is there enough?
-I have three packs.

545
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,282
-Really?
-Yeah.

546
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,158
-I'll have some.
-Okay.

547
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,291
-She is cute.
-She is.

548
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,460
I wonder if she heard.

549
00:29:56,253 --> 00:30:00,132
She's cute, but she seems busy.

550
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,228
If you're still interested in her
after a week,

551
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:17,524
don't worry about me.
Just go for it.

552
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,026
For Arisa?

553
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,570
It doesn't have to be now.

554
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,447
But something might still happen
between you two, right?

555
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,451
-Yeah, it seems so.
-Then you should keep approaching.

556
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,997
If we get to know each other...

557
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,541
and if I end up liking her,

558
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,294
I'm usually not bothered by other guys.

559
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,879
I usually think about myself first.

560
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,589
That's for the best.

561
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,799
I'll make my move then.
