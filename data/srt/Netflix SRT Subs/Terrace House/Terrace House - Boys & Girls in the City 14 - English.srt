1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,264
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,017
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,602
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,313
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,941
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,193
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,072
{\an8}Last week, Yuriko left <i>Terrace House...</i>

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,825
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,452
{\an8}<i>-She's going to focus on her exams.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,329
{\an8}<i>She's going to concentrate.</i>

11
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,166
{\an8}Last week, we had great guest appearances.

12
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,752
-Minori's big sister.
-Kurumi.

13
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,589
She was able to give a big push
to a stalling relationship.

14
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,173
She did.

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,300
{\an8}So you're afraid
his feelings aren't at that level?

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,384
{\an8}KURUMI NAKADA, 23 YEARS OLD

17
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,511
{\an8}Like, embracing you
because he can't hold back anymore?

18
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,306
{\an8}-Yeah, that'd be...
-That's totally what you want!

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,058
{\an8}Why don't you put yourself
in that mindset?

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,434
{\an8}I am.

21
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,312
{\an8}So seeing her sleeping face
doesn't make you want to kiss her?

22
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,438
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

23
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,232
{\an8}I can't bring myself to do it.

24
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,109
{\an8}But if you do something like that,

25
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,903
{\an8}it'll make everyone think,
"Wow, you like her that much."

26
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,321
{\an8}I'll try my best.

27
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,365
That was the Kurumi Mix.

28
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,409
They threw in the Kurumi Mix.

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,872
It's been very effective thus far.

30
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:25,210
It did seem to make Minori want to
take some action.

31
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,672
And Yamachan's favorite new member...

32
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,134
Don't say that!
What if she's watching?

33
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,220
-What's going on here?
-Yeah, what's up with that ugly guy there?

34
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,599
Call me obnoxious, but don't call me ugly.

35
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,769
{\an8}I'm Arisa Ohata.

36
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,561
{\an8}-Arisa?
-Arisa Ohata.

37
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:46,732
{\an8}-Where are you from?
-I'm from Kagoshima.

38
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,400
What do you do?

39
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,278
I'm now getting ready
to start my own hat brand.

40
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,114
Can I ask what's your type?

41
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,409
Someone who can survive
on a deserted island.

42
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,163
Not many people can give
an answer like that.

43
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,539
She's gotta be good.

44
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,082
Yamachan, you speak too soon.

45
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,670
-But she said she kinda liked Arman.
-Yeah.

46
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,297
Arman seemed easy to talk to.

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD

48
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,051
{\an8}He seems like he'd be able to survive
on a deserted island.

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,177
He's definitely that type.

50
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,639
No, I hope it doesn't work out
for her at <i>Terrace House.</i>

51
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,184
What are you trying to accomplish?

52
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,771
I hope she fails.
Arman should get together with Mizuki!

53
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,440
Oh, I don't know.

54
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,154
{\an8}Cheers.

55
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,830
-The new member's here.
-Yeah, finally.

56
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,332
She's cute. Very cute.

57
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,792
She is.

58
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,253
I didn't say it earlier,
but she's totally my type.

59
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,841
I think our eyes met when we both saw her.

60
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,927
I totally thought she'd be your type, too.

61
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,513
I guess it's down to which one of us
could survive on a deserted island.

62
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,480
-What about your job interview?
-The interview?

63
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
I heard back.

64
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,192
It was a no.

65
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,360
You really wanted it, too.

66
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,197
Yeah, but I'll give it another shot
at a different place.

67
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,291
-Can I come in?
-Oh, hey.

68
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,838
Joining us?
Clean it up, Arman.

69
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,425
-These aren't mine.
-Must be Uchi's.

70
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,554
-Man, that Uchi.
-Yeah, Uchi's so messy.

71
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,474
-A glass?
-I'll go grab one.

72
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,231
-What are you drinking?
-I didn't buy too much today.

73
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,194
-But aren't those from today?
-No, those aren't from today.

74
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,613
They were just there.

75
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,286
-You got me a glass.
-I'm sorry there isn't much left.

76
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,830
I should've come earlier.

77
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,416
We only have this and a small beer.

78
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,585
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

79
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,670
A toast?

80
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,174
-Thanks for letting me join.
-Welcome.

81
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,844
Cheers. It's nice to meet you.

82
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,474
I didn't expect you to join us for drinks.

83
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,352
Did you have a boyfriend until recently?

84
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,981
I haven't had a boyfriend
for about two years.

85
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,775
You must be popular.

86
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,403
I've never had a guy I liked
like me back.

87
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,155
What?

88
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,532
-Do you do any sports?
-Sports?

89
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,619
-I'm not good at sports all.
-That's fine.

90
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,330
You never played any?

91
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,498
In junior high,
I was manager of the baseball team.

92
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,666
Ah, a manager.

93
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,710
Do you go to the gym?

94
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,839
-Not at all.
-You look like you're in shape.

95
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,965
Thank you.

96
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,009
I jog sometimes.

97
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,387
-Shall we drink?
-Is there any left?

98
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,348
Should we go out to drink?

99
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,310
-I guess it's late. You've got work.
-I'll go buy some real quick.

100
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,897
I'll be right back.

101
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,406
-Have you gotten used to things?
-I have.

102
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,699
Really?

103
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,327
-I'm envious.
-You'll get used to it, too.

104
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,912
You think so?

105
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,415
Can you go anywhere with one bag?

106
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:37,254
About two years ago, I went to Thailand
and the Philippines with just a backpack.

107
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,297
-Really?
-Yeah.

108
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,009
I can hunt.

109
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,135
Hunt?

110
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,637
Well, when I was in Hawaii,
I would spear fish.

111
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,182
You dive and shoot them with a spear.

112
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,977
Where I'm from, it's all mountains.

113
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,980
So there's nothing, just the countryside.

114
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,566
-I'd like to live there in the future.
-Oh, you want to go back.

115
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,195
Sometimes I miss being in nature.

116
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,158
Like, recently, I climbed Mt. Takao
with a friend from my hometown.

117
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,659
Is that close to Tokyo?

118
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,787
-Yeah, it takes an hour by train.
-For real?

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,581
-Do you want to go?
-Let's go somewhere like that.

120
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,295
-You want to go to Mt. Takao? Really?
-Yeah, I've got time.

121
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,672
-Next week maybe?
-Okay.

129
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,432
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Morning.

130
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,028
-Did someone from the price tag shop call?
-Yeah, he did.

131
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:29,241
-He said he would come at 6:00 p.m.
-6:00 p.m.? Okay.

132
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,411
So you should prepare
the paper and data for the tags.

133
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,080
I see.

Hmm?

137
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,241
-What?
-Sleeping?

138
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,414
Your nails are chipping.
I can fix them.

139
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,458
I'm certified as a nail artist.

140

-Level four.
-What does that mean?

141
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,380
-How many levels are there?
-I don't know.

142
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,966
Okay, ready?

143
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,555
My pinky is fine.

144
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,975
-You got some here.
-Where?

145
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,027
You're shaking.

146
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,448
What did my sister say?

147
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,243
She said...
Well, never mind.

148
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,705
No, tell me.
It keeps me up at night.

149
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,459
She said I'm not conveying my feelings.

150
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,628
-That's what she said?
-Yes.

151
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,757
Did she give you examples of how to act?

152
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,677
I wonder.

153
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,555
I wonder.

154
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,517
I wonder.

155
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,564
-One-one?
-One-one.

156
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,029
-That was from over here.
-I didn't touch it.

157
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,451
I'm winning for the first time.

158
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,788
-Oh, wow, it's three-one.
-For real?

159
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,417
-From the start...
-You're in trouble, Arman.

160
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,710
I might win.

161
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,803
-I lost.
-My first win!

162
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,100
-I worked up a sweat.
-I'm gonna grab a drink.

163
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,228
Did you drink a lot last night?

164
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:07,774
Well, Yuki went to buy more drinks...

165
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,776
He bought more alcohol?

166
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,446
Yeah, he got more,
so we had highballs.

167
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,448
So, Mizuki...

168
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,119
is there someone you're into?

169
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:23,080
-I'm not sure yet, but...
-I see...

170
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,668
It's only been a week since Arman came,

171
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,423
but we went out together once.

172
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:36,594
Since then, I'm more conscious of him.

173
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,638
That's where I'm at.

174
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,518
You've changed since your sister came.

175
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,812
Have I? How?

176
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,522
You're trying to change.

177
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,982
-Change in what way?
-Hmm?

178
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,776
In what way?

179
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,445
Well, in many ways.

180
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,948
-I...
-You always make it vague.

181
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,409
What's wrong with that?

182
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,333
You're right.
I do always make it vague.

183
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,085
You don't say everything you're thinking.

184
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,129
I know, I need to fix that.

185
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,136
Will you make me curry?

186
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,055
-You want curry?
-I do.

187
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,242
Bon appétit.

188
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,328
Where are the meat and vegetables?

189
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,539
They kinda melted.

190
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,254
-Is everyone asleep?
-Hmm?

191
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,256
-Is everyone asleep?
-I think they're still up.

192
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,757
I think they're doing something.

193
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,387
Do you have work tomorrow?

194
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,597
Yeah, I've got work.

195
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,690
It was really good.

196
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,152
-Thank you for making it.
-Was it enough?

197
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,246
You're going to sleep?

198
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:09,080
-He's so stupid!
-So stupid!

199
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,125
So stupid!

200
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,086
So oblivious!

201
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,879
That was the notice-me missile.

202
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,634
Yes, she threw the notice-me missile.

203
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,637
So, the new thing is
the notice-me missile?

204
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,140
What was that? Just oblivious?

205
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,144
-She wanted him to make a move, right?
-What would you have done, Tokui?

206
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,190
He did her nails,
and then there was the curry...

207
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,985
I think, while doing her nails,

208
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,238
I'd move in,
and then she'd be like, "What?"

209
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,282
And then I'd say, "Oh, nothing."

210
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,872
That'd be my first move.
I'd throw that in there.

211
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,081
And then?

212
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,378
I'd throw that in first,
when nothing would happen.

213
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,546
I'd make her think,
"Oh, he tried to make a move."

214
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,090
And have her go make curry.

215
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,885
Since I threw that nothing move
in there first,

216
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,638
-I'd do nothing while eating curry.
-Oh, I see.

217
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,599
And it'll make her think, "Wait, what?"

218
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,226
She'd think,
"Oh, so nothing's gonna happen."

219
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,562
And lean back into the sofa.

220
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,065
Then the notice-me missile would fly.

221
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,278
No, but I'd make a move
before the notice-me missile.

222
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,821
When?

223
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,449
So, right when her nails are done,

224
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,913
he should grab her arm
and pull her towards him.

225
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,039
What?

226
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,668
He should already start pulling
as he's finishing her nails.

227
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,254
"Oh, but you just did my nails..."
Like that right?

228
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:45,385
Yeah, and then some of the polish
would smudge on the hand.

229
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,932
And they'd come apart and say,
"Look what you did to my hands."

230
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,267
And then he should kiss her again!

231
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,437
Nice.

232
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:01,067
Even you got that, right?
That a kiss should've happened there?

233
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,193
Yeah, I think so.

234
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,447
If it were me, when serving the curry,

235
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,032
I'd want him to ask me
to feed him the curry.

236
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,325
What?

237
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,995
That's so cute!

238
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,914
"Minori, the meat
to go along with the curry."

239
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,709
What are you saying?

240
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,587
"I'm sorry. Kill me, please."

241
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,964
-"This piece is too big."
-Oh, quiet you.

242
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,382
What the heck are you guys talking about?

243
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,927
But seriously, what's up with him?

244
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,222
-Maybe he's actually surprisingly shy.
-Maybe.

245
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:36,143
Though Minori was trying really hard.

246
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,854
She tried to give him opportunities.

247
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:43,109
And he knows
she's been wanting more out of him.

248
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,153
If he didn't do it then,
when will he do it?

249
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,115
That's true.
If not now, then when?

250
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,828
We've been so caught up.
We've forgotten Arman's making moves.

251
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,954
That's right.

252
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,584
Did you see how sad Mizuki looked
when they were playing ping-pong?

253
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,336
When she was keeping score.

254
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,714
It was sad.

255
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,259
-Arisa now knows how Mizuki feels.
-She told her.

256
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,763
The question is, what will she do
now that she knows?

257
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,180
She's gonna throw Arman a light jab.

258
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,307
When Arman comes after her,
she's gonna say, "Oh, no.

259
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,520
Mizuki likes you, so I can't."

260
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,480
All the while, making him come after her.

261
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,525
It's Arman's fault if he follows.

262
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,359
She said no, so he shouldn't go.

263
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,236
You've changed, man.

264
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,908
What happened to your black wings?

265
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,869
Look, I'm wearing a fluffy knit sweater.

266
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,413
-It's gentle.
-Oh, the one reserved for the good guys.

267
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,545
Did Uchi like your curry last night?

268
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,714
-He said it was tasty, but that was it.
-That was it?

269
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,050
And today?

270
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,928
I'm making omu-rice today.

271
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
-For Uchi?
-I'm going to make it for him.

272
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,224
You should clearly say,
"Look, I made this just for you."

273
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,226
So that he gets it?

274
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,522
-Do you have work tomorrow?
-I do.

275
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,443
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-I'm going to run in the morning,

276
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,906
and in the evening, I'm going to Target.

277
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,490
The gym?

278
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,243
I want to join a gym, too.

279
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,706
You should come to Target.
Are you interested in kickboxing?

280
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,666
Kickboxing?

281
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,959
-Yeah.
-You want to?

282
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,878
Kickboxing? Not the gym?

283
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,923
Well, you should come check it out.

284
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,425
I want to lift my butt.

285
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,345
-Squats are best for that.
-That's so hard.

286
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,014
Yeah, they're a hassle to do.

287
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,060
Sounds like they're having fun.

288
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,395
-Sounds like they're having fun.
-Does it?

289
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,111
-What's going on?
-Yeah, sounds like fun.

290
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,616
-Please.
-Looks good.

291
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,701
Don't judge by its appearance.

292
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,120
Bon appétit!

293
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,872
They've got our names on them.

294
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,165
-Did you notice?
-I did.

295
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,333
There was a heart, too.

296
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,336
-I didn't.
-What?

297
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,173
-Delicious.
-Yummy!

298
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,259
It's hot.

299
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,430
What did you do yesterday?

300
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,767
I was talking with Uchi.

301
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,019
Have things changed since we last spoke?

302
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,437
Not really.

303
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,024
He's probably got some pride issues.

304
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,486
-Because he doesn't know how?
-Yeah.

305
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,032
I think it'd be okay for him
to be more lovey-dovey with you.

306
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,075
-I agree.
-Nothing.

307
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,244
Yeah, I did talk to him about that before.

308
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,041
What should I write on his omu-rice
to get his attention?

309
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,168
"I love you."

310
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,337
That might be too forward.

311
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,839
Easy to write but...

312
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,301
Maybe hearts?
It could be cute.

313
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,637
"Welcome home," or maybe not.

314
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,440
Dear Uchi,
Welcome back.

315
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,358
Please eat and enjoy.

316
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,077
"Coward"?

317
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,679
-What did you write?
-"Coward."

318
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,559
-That's perfect.
-I wonder what he'll think.

319
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,688
He'll think it's cute,
but I'm sure it'll hit a sore spot.

320
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,606
Like an arrow going through.

321
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,234
I wrote it, great,
but now I can't face him.

322
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,380
Ooh, I want this.

323
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,299
-That looks expensive.
-It is.

324
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,010
If only I could have one.

325
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,014
Come in.

326
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,307
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

327
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,643
Minori, come here, will you?

328
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,478
What is it?

329
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,022
Here? Is that okay?

330
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,398
-Come over here.
-What? Why?

331
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,066
-Never mind why.
-Why?

332
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,193
Just come this way.

333
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,737
I'm scared.

334
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,369
Over here.

335
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,871
-What?
-Here.

336
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,706
Close your eyes until I say to open them.

337
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,376
What? No, I'm scared.

338
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,462
-I'm scared.
-Just close your eyes.

339
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,050
-Lift your chin.
-Why? Why?

340
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,386
-Keep your eyes closed. Don't worry.
-I'm scared.

341
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,389
Never mind then.

342
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,767
I scared you.

343
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,283
The two of them disappeared.

344
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,211
You wrote "coward."

345
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,338
-I did.
-What did that mean?

346
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,923
Exactly what it said.

347
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,758
Since you called me a coward...

348
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,431
I felt like I had to prove you wrong.

349
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,726
But there are other ways to do that.

350
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,604
At this point, it doesn't matter.

351
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,982
I need to be emotionally prepared.

352
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,736
When will you be prepared?

353
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,740
I wasn't expecting to see you today.

354
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,999
I'm going back down then.

355
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,381
-Thanks for the omu-rice.
-Yeah.

356
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,731
Minori...

357
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,779
Are you all right?

358
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,865
-Are you crying?
-No, I'm not crying.

359
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,451
How'd it go?

360
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,621
-I was surprised.
-Of course you'd be.

361
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,998
Of course.

362
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,835
I wrote it, sort of egging him on...

363
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,837
so I guess...

364
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,590
of course he'd react.

365
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,342
He wasn't mad per se,

366
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,846
but he wasn't happy
about being called a coward.

367
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:13,767
So he wanted to show me otherwise.

368
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,771
But I totally wasn't expecting it.

369
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,149
Oh, he's so terrible at this!

370
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,028
So, that was his reaction.

371
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,489
-I hope he does better.
-Must have been hard for you to watch.

372
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:33,454
-He said it three times.
-Yeah, he kept saying, "Close your eyes."

373
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:38,000
He thought I wasn't ready for it.

374
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,670
-Was he upset?
-Yeah, I think he was a little down.

375
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,342
Maybe I should go talk to him.
I'm calm now.

376
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,012
What will you say to him?

377
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,639
He probably thinks I rejected him.

378
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,142
-So you're going to tell him otherwise?
-Yeah.

379
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,483
And if I leave things like this,

380
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,070
it'll be really awkward tomorrow.

381
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,160
What the heck is he doing?

382
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,038
Why is he dragging it out?

383
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,958
Despite the fact that he's good-looking
and stylish...

384
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,919
maybe he's a virgin?

385
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,634
-He is giving off that vibe.
-I'm strongly detecting it.

386
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,427
He's never had a relationship?

387
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,513
I didn't understand it.

388
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,098
Lifting her chin...

389
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,225
in front of everyone?

390
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,060
What would've happened after that?

391
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,729
He would've tried to kiss her after that.

392
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,440
She called him a coward,
so he went to prove her wrong.

393
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,984
Like, "See, I can kiss you."

394
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,487
That's so lame!

395
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,742
Even though there's still lots
that Uchi doesn't know,

396
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,244
he hasn't been able to ask.

397
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,870
For a long time now, probably.

398
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,206
People just assume
he's gone out with lots of girls.

399
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,833
That he's good at his job
and sensitive to others' needs,

400
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,254
-that is his weakness.
-I see.

401
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,049
But he's the one who first said
he'd date all three.

402
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,552
That's exactly why he came up with
such an awkward idea.

403
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,803
That's proof.

404
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,681
He didn't do that
because he was experienced with women.

405
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,100
It's because he didn't know any better.

406
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,102
He genuinely didn't know
how to fall in love.

407
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,604
So he wanted to figure it out
by trying it out with everyone.

408
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,773
His intentions were truly pure.

409
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,608
-Seriously?
-So unexpected.

410
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,403
You know, the coward part...

411
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,281
-that was something.
-It made my heart pound.

412
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,907
That was really cute.

413
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,993
That was a legendary omu-rice.

414
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,746
-Truly legendary.
-A legendary omu-rice.

415
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,457
"Coward."

416
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,669
-Wonderful.
-It really is.

417
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,339
So she's going to see him now?

418
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,924
I think so.
She's gonna go, then kiss!

419
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,301
Go, then kiss?

420
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,052
Yeah, go to get kissed.

421
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,930
Even if she isn't planning to.

422
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,100
To the far end of <i>Terrace House</i> we go,
then kiss?

423
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,396
If he misses this chance, then that's it.

424
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,357
We're rooting for you, Uchi.

425
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,318
He just has to go for it.

426
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,070
-Doesn't matter if he's bad at it.
-Oh, bittersweet youth.

427
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,448
"I know how to kiss!"

428
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,032
So cute!

429
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,451
Okay! The kiss!

430
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,496
You don't have to be an expert.

431
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,095
Come in.

432
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,351
What's up?

433
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,977
What's wrong?

434
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,647
-I thought I'd come talk to you.
-Talk?

435
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,985
I'm sorry about earlier.

436
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,320
Don't worry about it.

437
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,781
This is unusual.

438
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,700
-I've calmed down.
-Calmed down?

439
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,746
I was totally out of sorts earlier
and couldn't speak.

440
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,624
I see. I was so surprised.

441
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,837
I wrote that
with a specific intention in mind.

442
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,507
Because yesterday...

443
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,093
I didn't think you would react that way.

444
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,264
So I didn't know how to deal with it.

445
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,225
You didn't know how to react.

446
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:28,230
I thought I was prepared for it,

447
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,107
but it kind of happened in a way
I wasn't expecting.

448
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,280
Do you like me?

449
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,451
I like you.

450
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,581
Are you ready now?

451
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,376
I've been ready.

452
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,800
That's why I wrote "coward."

453
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,851
Close your eyes.

454
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,066
You seemed so experienced.

455
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,610
I'm not.

456
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,820
-What?
-I'm not.

457
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,749
I'm sorry I can't do it better.

458
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,629
Thank you.
