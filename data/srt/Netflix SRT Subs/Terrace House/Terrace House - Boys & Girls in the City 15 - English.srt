1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,264
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,934
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,519
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,229
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,691
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,568
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,446
-Let's see, last week...
-Oh, yes.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,701
Minori and Tatsuya finally got together.

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,035
Oh, they kissed!

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,121
Remember the legendary missile?

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,916
{\an8}<i>She wrote "coward" on Tatsuya's omu-rice,</i>

12
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:46,672
{\an8}<i>because even though the mood</i>
<i>was right for something to happen,</i>

13
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,256
{\an8}<i>he just fell asleep.</i>

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,052
{\an8}<i>-That's right, the cushion.</i>
<i>-Yes, the notice-me missile.</i>

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,971
{\an8}Are you ready now?

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,264
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

17
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,851
{\an8}That's why I wrote "coward."

18
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,646
{\an8}-You seemed so experienced.
-I'm not.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,439
{\an8}-What?
-I'm not.

20
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,655
{\an8}<i>With that kiss, we all realized</i>
<i>that all of Tatsuya's previous actions</i>

21
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,950
were just a reflection
of his inexperience with love.

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,077
All of it came together in that moment.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,663
It was refreshing to watch.

24
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,584
Now that they've kissed...

25
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,294
They're young.
It's gonna be hard to stop.

26
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,420
It'll be hard.

27
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,339
-They'll be making babies.
-They won't stop.

28
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,009
And on the flipside...

29
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,011
That's right.

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,223
-Though things looked good for Mizuki...
-Then <i>she</i> came.

31
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,892
{\an8}Sometimes I miss being in nature.

32
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,393
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD

33
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,353
{\an8}Like, recently, I climbed Mt. Takao.

34
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,647
{\an8}Is that close to Tokyo?

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,232
{\an8}-Do you want to go?
-Let's go somewhere like that.

36
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,984
{\an8}I want to join a gym, too.

37
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,819
{\an8}You should come to Target.

38
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,031
{\an8}<i>But he's already invited Mizuki</i>
<i>to his match on December 13th!</i>

39
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,325
Oh, Arisa from Kagoshima.

40
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,539
Maybe this new environment in the city
is clouding her judgment.

41
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,374
Guys like you, Yamachan,

42
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,796
tend to just assume
a girl is pure and innocent.

43
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,380
And when you find she's really not,

44
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,841
you say, "You betrayed me!"
That's not good, Yamachan.

45
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,885
It's a characteristic of a stalker.

46
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,261
I know this girl's not like that.

47
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,513
She's not one of those wanton women.

48
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,057
Oh, so you've met her before?

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,474
No, I've just seen her here.

50
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,523
{\an8}-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

51
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,739
Look at your expression.

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,283
How'd it go?

53
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,619
We kissed.

54
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,458
Wait, wait a sec.

55
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,253
How? How did it happen?

56
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,631
He asked me if I liked him.

57
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,009
I told him I do.

58
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,680
-And?
-And then...

59
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,183
Then it just sort of...

60
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,852
happened.

61
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,020
Oh, man, that's so great!

62
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,105
Was he smooth?

63
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,023
No, not really.

64
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,070
Well, he said it himself.

65
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,446
I see.

66
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,823
But that's good.

67
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,449
Yeah. I'm happy, I think.

68
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,370
These heart-pounding moments
before the relationship are the best.

69
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,958
-Relationship?
-You're going out now, right?

70
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,336
We didn't talk about it.

71
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,757
We only talked about how we felt.

72
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,093
French? How many seconds?

73
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,721
-Nothing that intense.
-You used your tongue?

74
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,098
I didn't.
Dude, no.

75
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,642
I didn't do that.

76
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,021
-Not deep? A pretty one then.
-Yeah.

77
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,648
-Use your tongue on the next one.
-I won't.

78
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,442
-I won't
-You won't?

79
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,319
She's gonna write "coward" again.

80
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,531
Now that you've kissed,

81
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,201
are you guys in a relationship then?

82
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,496
We didn't talk about that.

83
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,373
So you're not officially a couple yet.

84
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,501
I guess not.
But we have feelings for each other.

85
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,217
Going to Korea with my co-workers!
Uchi

86
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,181
{\an8}Mino.

87
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,767
Morning.

88
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,730
-You slept out here?
-I fell asleep.

89
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:33,857
You're awake.

90
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,444
I'm going to Korea.

91
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,988
Have a good trip.
For how long?

92
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,698
I think three days.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,410
-With co-workers.
-You're so lucky.

94
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:50,457
Before I leave for Korea,
there's something I wanted to clarify.

95
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,793
Why are you laughing?

96
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,589
That kiss means
you're okay with us being exclusive?

97
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,926
You're asking me now?

98
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,012
I just thought I'd better make sure.

99
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,348
I wanted to know.

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,225
-You want me to ask?
-No, no.

101
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,268
Will you go out with me?

102
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,314
Yes, I will.

103
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,317
Don't sound so excited.

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,029
-Can I get some enthusiasm?
-Yes!

105
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,990
-It sounds lackluster.
-No, it's not.

106
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,242
It's embarrassing.

107
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,871
-So we're together now?
-We're together.

108
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,205
I see.

109
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,126
All right.

110
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,211
Guess I'll be going then.

111
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,131
Have a good trip.

112
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,466
You're not gonna kiss me goodbye?

113
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,886
-You want me to?
-I do.

114
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,641
See you when I get back!

One, two. One two.

136
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,482
Very good.

137
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,448
Last one.

138
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,867
Okay, let's take a break.

139

-You're good.
-Am I?

Go Arman!

143
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,256
Begin!

144
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,141
Nice!

145
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,484
Get a kick in. Nice!

146
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,736
Just throw punches if you're tired.

147
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,114
Attack.

148
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,158
Good. Move in.

149
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,203
Last 30 seconds.

150
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,210
Don't go down, don't go down.

151
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,295
Move in.

152
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,215
Okay.

153
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,301
Okay.

154
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,054
-Are you all right, Arman?
-Yes.

155
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,305
You seemed like
you were going to throw up.

156
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,223
Been drinking?

157
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,808
-A little.
-A little?

158
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,976
I need to quit.
I have about one a day.

159
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,770
One a day?

160
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,314
Well, you have another month.

161
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,650
-But the last two to three weeks...
-Nothing for the last two or three weeks.

162
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,652
I understand. I won't.

163
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,572
-Thank you.
-See you next time.

164
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,574
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

165
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,041
-Man, I'm tired. Rain?
-It's raining.

166
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,961
-Just a little.
-I don't have an umbrella.

167
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,590
-Here.
-Thank you.

168
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,093
-That was hard work.
-Yeah.

169
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,720
It was amazing.

170
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,513
For the match...

171
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,808
Yeah, that was about 60% effort.

172
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,393
I wonder if I can watch.

173
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,231
They're together!

174
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,149
Congratulations!

175
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,570
{\an8}-Couple number four.
-That's right.

176
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,199
{\an8}One out of very few couples from the show.

177
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,534
{\an8}I guess it's difficult for couples
to get together,

178
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,537
{\an8}especially when living together.
You see things you don't want to see.

179
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,540
{\an8}So, it's not very easy.

180
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,502
{\an8}There isn't always an attraction either.

181
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,631
But with the guys' conversation,
Arman was pretty vulgar.

182
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,383
"Did you stick your tongue in?"

183
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,719
And he officially asks her out
sitting on the sofa.

184
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,970
They shared another kiss.

185
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,599
Oh, and what's with the hood thing?

186
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:05,147
It's nothing, just a little embarrassment
after the kiss.

187
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,649
Oh, to hide her embarrassment?

188
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,819
But the girls were just saying
they'd want the guy to pull up the hood,

189
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,156
and with the eyes covered they'd say,

190
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,034
"What's going on?"
and the guy would drop a kiss.

191
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,369
Oh, I see.

192
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,789
Triendl likes the hood idea as well.

193
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,083
I'd want him to pull the hood down
with a "wham!"

194
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,378
A "wham"?

195
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,213
-A "wham!"
-Sounds powerful.

196
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,798
Did you mean to use that term?

197
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:36,093
If you have a foreigner for a dad,
it's "wham."

198
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,095
Like "bow wow"?

199
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,931
I see.

200
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,516
So it's "wham!"

201
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,851
My mistake.

202
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,438
Oh, Babachan's wearing a "wham" jacket.

203
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,148
Wham!

204
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,742
Congratulations to them,
but what about the other members?

205
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,453
Yeah, what's with that?

206
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,205
Arman and Arisa are almost...

207
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,832
When Daiki, the trainer,
was explaining things to Arman,

208
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:11,045
she was standing next to him with water
as if she was already his girlfriend.

209
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,130
You can tell me if I'm wrong.

210
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,845
-You're wrong.
-You think so?

211
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,848
Arman seems like he'd come on strong.

212
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,767
Guys from Hawaii have that impression.

213
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,894
And the first kiss has tongue, right?

214
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,941
I will stop him. Yes.

215
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,860
What can you possibly do?

216
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,821
What can you do
from this side of the screen?

217
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:41,117
For now, after this episode,
I'm starting a 2-chan topic from my phone.

218
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,036
For what?

219
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,205
About how Arman is a player.

220
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,167
Are we in elementary school?

221
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,301
{\an8}-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

222
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,136
What are you doing?

223
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,514
-I'm making bento.
-Wow.

224
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,141
-For tomorrow?
-For tomorrow.

225
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,810
I'm going to Mt. Takao tomorrow.

226
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,562
You're going to eat it at the top?

227
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah, at the top of the mountain.

228
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,279
Do you cook often?

229
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:22,784
I do when I have a boyfriend,
but I haven't been recently.

230
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,577
How is it with Arman?

231
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,995
-Arman?
-Yeah.

232
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,747
He was great at the gym.

233
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,206
Well, you know...

234
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,169
-He looked good?
-He did.

235
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:38,758
He was good, like he could survive
on a deserted island.

236
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,344
When you said that,
I totally thought of Arman.

237
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,680
He seems wild.

238
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,976
I'm going to go take a bath.

239
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,145
Later.

240
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,837
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,296
Oh, wow.

242
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,842
Is that bento?

243
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,760
Are you going somewhere tomorrow?

244
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:26,889
I'm going to Mt. Takao tomorrow
with Arman.

245
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,601
Mt. Takao? Wow.

246
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,686
So that's your bento
to eat at the summit?

247
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,230
Mountain hiking, huh?

248
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,232
Yeah.

249
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,984
Hopefully the weather will be nice.

250
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,363
-So last time...
-Yeah.

251
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,449
When we were playing table tennis,

252
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,827
you mentioned
you were interested in Arman.

253
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:54,917
I find Arman really easy to talk to...

254
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,883
so I made plans with him
to go to Mt. Takao.

255
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,137
I've wanted to tell you.

256
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,558
Go have fun.

257
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,562
You should go have fun.

258
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,151
There's always tomorrow.

259
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,153
I think I'll take a bath and go to bed.

260
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,367
I'm going upstairs.

261
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:53,267
I'm not sure what to think.

262
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,436
Did you see downstairs?

263
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,396
-I did.
-You did.

264
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,648
-I don't know.
-Is it jealousy?

265
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,733
-Jealousy?
-Or not?

266
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,860
I'm not sure.

267
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,906
I thought it'd be okay at my own pace.

268
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,369
But maybe it's pressure?

269
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,664
But Arisa came...

270
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,291
I know she's a nice person.

271
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,710
And cute.

272
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,131
And I know she's interested in Arman.

273
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,759
She told me that again.

274
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,763
So I'm not...

275
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:35,267
Maybe it is jealousy, I don't know.

276
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,322
{\an8}MT. TAKAO STATION
HACHIOJI, TOKYO

277
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,493
{\an8}-We're here.
-Here.

278
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,580
Oh, there's a map.

279
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,004
Which should we do?

280
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,172
-The red trail?
-The red?

281
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,925
-That south side is the hardest part.
-Oh, really?

282
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,136
Let's do an easy one then.

283
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,515
Oh, these maple leaves are red.

284
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,476
It's the same tree, too.

285
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,686
Yeah, it's green over here.

286
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,522
I wonder why.

287
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,903
I've never been on a suspension bridge.

288
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,156
Oh, it shakes.

289
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,574
Stop it!

290
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,038
-It's shaking.
-Yeah.

291
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,044
Everyone's doing it.

292
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,797
Wow.

293
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,089
Oh, it moves a lot.

294
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,225
Watch your step.

295
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,815
We still have a long way to go.

296
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,817
But that looks like the top.

297
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,655
Oh, that's true.
I guess we're close.

298
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,539
{\an8}MT. TAKAO SUMMIT

299
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,457
We came at the best time.

300
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,918
A little crowded though.

301
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,129
Is it a holiday today?

302
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,048
-No?
-It's a regular weekday.

303
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,051
-It's crowded for a weekday.
-There's school too, right?

304
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,260
Maybe everyone's ditching.

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,556
-No, they're not!
-They must be ditching.

306
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,851
Okay.

307
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,143
-We made it?
-We made it.

308
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,939
Finally.

309
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,317
Wow.

310
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,864
-There's a Ferris wheel there.
-Is that Odaiba?

311
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,324
No, that's totally not!

312
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,870
It feels nice.

313
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,330
It was worth the hike.

314
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,791
Let's go on another adventure sometime.

315
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,084
Yeah.

316
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,087
-I'll go to the gym, too.
-Yeah, definitely.

317
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,883
I'm looking forward to the match, too.

318
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,512
-I'm hungry.
-Do you want to go eat?

319
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,056
-I made lunch for us.
-You did?

320
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,267
-Is that why you were up so late?
-Yes.

321
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,394
That's why I said, "Don't come in!"

322
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,813
Thank you.

323
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,607
Let's eat.

324
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,529
Ta-da!

325
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,156
Looks good.

326
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,448
Spam musubi!

327
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,368
-From Hawaii.
-Yeah, thanks.

328
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,581
It's good, the Spam.

329
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,752
The Spam?

330
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,212
-Yeah, the Spam.
-I bought the Spam.

331
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,925
It's good, seriously.

332
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:59,013
-We keep doing active stuff.
-We're always moving.

333
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,142
Kickboxing, hiking, what's next?

334
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,687
I want to go somewhere more relaxed.

335
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,938
Sounds good.

336
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,900
-Like where?
-Like...

337
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,111
Like shopping?

338
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,364
Yeah, like running errands together.

339
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,867
I do need winter clothes.

340
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,954
-I'll help you look for some.
-Thanks.

341
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,665
You can help me find a good hat.

342
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,893
-Work?
-Yeah.

343
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,606
-Tired?
-Yeah, a little tired.

344
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,234
Of course.

345
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,194
-The mountain.
-The mountain.

346
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,239
Did Arman like it?

347
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,699
The bento?

348
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,910
You stayed up late making it.

349
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,251
How was your first outing together?

350
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,169
The first outing?

351
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,801
It was really easy being with him.

352
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,888
-The whole day?
-Yeah.

353
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,356
You must be cold.

354
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,359
Maybe I'll go take a bath.

355
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,071
-The hot water is ready.
-Thanks.

356
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,991
I'll go first then.

357
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,492
-Okay.
-Okay.

358
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,968
What is this?

359
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,680
He did it so naturally.

360
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,017
Holding hands in Japan is a big deal.

361
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,852
But he just did it.

362
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:14,315
Is it just a normal thing
for Westerners or what?

363
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,233
I'm sure that's part of it.

364
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:20,154
But girls notice it
when a guy takes their hand, right?

365
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,324
-She's aware of it.
-Yeah.

366
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,827
Maybe she's not the one.

367
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,329
Who? Arisa?

368
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,082
She's not who I thought she was.

369
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,043
She's different from what you thought?

370
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,837
She was taken by Arman.

371
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,047
Well, nothing's decided yet.

372
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,468
Let's decide after we see what happens
in the next couple of weeks.

373
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,014
They hiked holding hands
and made plans for the next date.

374
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,100
-She said that.
-Arisa did.

375
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,728
I'm going to decide about Arisa,

376
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,482
after this week, or next week.

377
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,650
He's scary.
We've seen this pattern before.

378
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,653
The kind that makes headlines...

379
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,241
She's not going to betray
my image of Arisa.

380
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,619
That's creepy.

381
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,747
It's okay.
She's being led astray for now.

382
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,375
She'll come back to me in the end.

383
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,128
How creepy!

384
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,921
-How creepy!
-So creepy!

385
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,174
But Mizuki seems...

386
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,510
Her feelings are apparent in her behavior.

387
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,596
-That can't be helped.
-Of course, that'll happen.

388
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,393
Oh, maybe this is Tap's chance!

389
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,353
-For Mizuki?
-Yeah.

390
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,688
He's gonna stick his shoes in?

391
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,695
"Oh, what is that soothing sound?"

392
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,615
Tap's feet appear under the girls' door.

393
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,034
Don't be ridiculous.

394
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,389
-Good morning.
-Morning.

395
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,602
Your breakfast is so healthy.

396
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,104
It is, isn't it?

397
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,481
You're not eating?

398
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,900
-Oh, I ate already.
-I see.

399
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,819
I got up early.

400
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,988
-Work today?
-Yeah.

401
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,033
-Where?
-In the office today.

402
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,742
-At the office?
-Yeah.

403
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,623
-Arman, let's go out to eat sometime.
-Sure.

404
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,171
-It's set, then.
-When do you want to go?

405
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,257
-The weekend maybe?
-The weekend? Okay.

406
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:49,595
-Are you free on Sunday?
-I am.

407
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,305
-Let's go.
-Okay.

408
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,266
Let me know the details later.

409
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,604
-I have to go to my training session.
-Oh, yeah.

410
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,440
-In the afternoon?
-Just weights today.

411
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,361
-And kickboxing at night.
-At night?

412
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,155
Have a good session.
See you.

413
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:32,471
THE SEASON HAS BEEN EXTENDED.
TERRACE HOUSE IS NOT FINISHING YET!
