1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,264
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show
about six strangers, men and women

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,060
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,688
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:24,316
{\an8}All that we've prepared
is a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,401
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,031
Let's see, a lot happened
in the last episode.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,911
First, even though Tatsuya
spoke with Makoto,

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,873
Makoto just sulked and wouldn't reconcile.

10
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,669
{\an8}I'll get angry next time. Really.
I may kick your butt.

11
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,463
{\an8}Mizuki told me to apologize to you two.

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,590
{\an8}Yeah, I want an apology from you.

13
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,382
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

14
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,677
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,848
Earlier, we all talked about
how we should share our thoughts,

16
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,475
about who likes or dislikes whom,
about which girl we're into or not into.

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,937
But if it's just going to leak out,
I'm not going to share my thoughts.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,397
If you don't want to share,
you don't need to.

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,775
I won't share anything then.

20
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,445
-Anyone would respond that way.
-Anyone would.

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,740
If he says it like that,
that's the reaction you'd get.

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,284
{\an8}Tatsuya and Minori
went to Izu Oshima on a date.

23
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,703
{\an8}<i>It was a nice date.</i>

24
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,747
{\an8}Cows.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,749
{\an8}-Cows!
-Cows!

26
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,500
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD
TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

27
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,127
{\an8}<i>Yuki and Yuriko went</i>
<i>to the aquarium for their date.</i>

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,962
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD
YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD

29
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,505
{\an8}I want to go to Blue Note.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,840
{\an8}What? Blue Note?

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,174
{\an8}Let's go.

32
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,676
{\an8}You mean it?

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,302
"I want to go to Blue Note."

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:38,181
Yuriko only sees Tap as Mr. Ticket.

35
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,893
Sometimes it's Mr. Tap,
and sometimes it's Mr. Ticket.

36
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,980
And Yuriko visited Mizuki at the café.

37
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,691
-And surprisingly...
-Surprisingly...

38
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,529
She revealed that Makoto
was still her top choice.

39
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,782
-He's still...
-I know you don't dislike him.

40
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,825
He's still at the top.

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,118
-The top?
-The top.

42
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,912
<i>And at the very end, Makoto...</i>

43
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,705
-Yes, he did it.
-What was that anyway?

44
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,498
The mysterious playroom incident.

45
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,293
{\an8}There was the Uchi Week, right?

46
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,211
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD
MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD

47
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,299
{\an8}He announced that he was gonna have a date
with each of you.

48
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,136
{\an8}I felt that it was wrong.

49
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,182
{\an8}I saw her making lunch for the date.

50
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,559
{\an8}That kind of thing

51
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,895
{\an8}made me lose interest in her.

52
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,855
That was so lame.

53
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,316
He's just bad-mouthing people.

54
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,360
And when someone doesn't side with him,
he gets all sad about it.

55
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,323
That's it! Makoto has a bad habit
of talking bad about others.

56
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,783
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

57
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,743
-Shall we watch?
-Shall we?

58
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,494
What's going to happen today?

59
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:46,041
I think Makoto's gonna keep rolling.
It's crazy how his stock's crashing.

60
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,379
{\an8}You know, yesterday?

61
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,967
It's about Makocchan.

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,468
Something bad about Makocchan?

63
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,594
Yeah, something bad.

64
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,929
You know how I...

65
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,391
initially said I liked Makocchan?

66
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,480
We went running together,
and went to eat Yakiniku together.

67
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:13,110
And it felt like
there was something there, but...

68
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,741
He told everyone how he's gonna be serious
about baseball, right?

69
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,160
And so I thought,
"Wow, he works really hard."

70
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,746
And I thought that was great.

71
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:29,501
But he started staying up late again.

72
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,212
And he snacks all the time.

73
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,089
That's right, he does.

74
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,299
And he blabbed to you,

75
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,763
and Uchi and Mizuki
got mad at him about it.

76
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,516
And it kind of made me think,

77
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,518
"Even though I liked him..."

78
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,644
Really?

79
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:52,024
And later,
after Uchi and I went to Izu Oshima,

80
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:56,694
he sent me a message like before.

81
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:04,286
And he told me about
what you and him had talked about,

82
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,748
about how he liked me at first.

83
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,918
But after seeing me go
to Izu Oshima with Uchi,

84
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,046
he no longer felt the same way.

85
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,089
He supposedly had said
something like that to you.

86
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,301
But that wasn't really true.

87
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,386
Or so he told me.

88
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:27,017
So he's basically saying that he told me
he no longer has feelings for you,

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,227
but that he regrets saying that?

90
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,648
Yeah. And so he said we should
hang out together sometime.

91
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,859
That's what he said in his message.

92
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,778
I don't get what he really wants.

93
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,782
I mean, what he wants with me.

94
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,077
How do you feel about it?

95
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,706
If he asks me out on a date,
then I'll try going.

96
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,249
And then I want to think about it.

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,626
I see.

98
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,212
But if he doesn't ask,

99
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,589
then it makes me wonder
what he really wants.

100
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,884
I hate when things are this ambiguous.

101
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,678
It doesn't make him look good.

102

109
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,059
{\an8}How are things going over there?

110
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,518
{\an8}Lots of issues.

111
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,602
{\an8}Issues? Again?

{\an8}Arguments and guy problems.

{\an8}Guy problems?

{\an8}MIKI TAKEUCHI, DIRECTOR OF THE SALON

116
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,568
{\an8}You mean, because you like a guy?

117
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,111
{\an8}No, not like that.

118
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,821
{\an8}No, it's not like that.

119
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,114
{\an8}I...

120
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,119
{\an8}Well, I went on a date
with this girl named Yuriko.

121
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,204
{\an8}MEGURI KOJIMA, HAIR STYLIST

122
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,081
{\an8}And to be honest,

123
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,375
I felt like I had to cater to her,
and felt a little tired afterwards.

124
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,841
And Makocchan told her
that when he saw her...

125
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,885
Makocchan. That little...

126
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,764
And so, Makocchan's still
kind of keeping his distance.

127
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,518
He's saying, no, he's got his own stance.

128
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,355
So he's not willing to compromise?

129
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,148
I don't think it's possible.

130
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,316
Impossible?

131
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,527
I think we're probably both very stubborn.

132
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,863
-So neither of you is willing to bend?
-No.

133
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,199
You can't reach a kind of understanding?

134
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,785
Well, I can't understand
his actions at all.

135
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,580
Well, yeah. That's true.
I can't either.

136
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,665
I don't understand.

137
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,504
When the girls were first talking
about which guy they were into,

138
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,381
your name didn't come up, Uchihara?

139
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,634
Yeah, we saw that.

140
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:52,305
Well, I've narrowed it down
to one person out of the three.

141
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,016
-You did?
-Yes.

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,020
Is that something we'll have to confirm
by watching the show?

143
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,024
Yes, if you don't mind watching the show.

144
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,901
Really?

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,116
-Wait, wait a second.
-This is getting crazy.

146
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,951
Mr. Yamasato, will you explain
what just happened?

147
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,162
Yes, please.

148
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,829
Let's start with Minori and Yuriko.

149
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,042
Minori gets a message from Makoto.

150
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:25,838
In the message, he said he told Yuriko
his feelings for Minori had diminished,

151
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,925
but in fact, that's not really true.

152
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:34,431
And Minori is like, "What does this mean?"
And she tells Yuriko about it.

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,308
-This is bad.
-This is bad.

154
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,394
It's really disgusting, actually.

155
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,897
So the fact is that he told Yuriko
he didn't have feelings for Minori,

156
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,274
and then tells everything to Minori.

157
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,483
That's just it.

158
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,027
-It's very strange.
-It is strange.

159
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,072
-Yeah, it's unnecessary.
-Yes, totally unnecessary thing to say.

160
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,282
It doesn't feel good to hear.

161
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,742
Amazing!
He really doesn't get how people feel.

162
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,161
He doesn't.

163
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,580
Tatsuya is looking more and more decent.

164
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,290
More manly, even.

165
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,833
Extremely decent.

166
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,211
Especially when you see it like this,

167
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,755
where our own relationships
aren't publicized.

168
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,343
Maybe we're all like that.

169
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,886
You're right,
maybe we're doing bad things too.

170
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,308
It seemed like
he wanted all the women to think,

171
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,477
"He's only thinking of me."

172
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,063
Yeah, when talking to Yuriko,

173
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,108
he made it seem like
he was only thinking of her.

174
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,737
And to Minori, even if she hears about it,
he still wants her to think he's into her.

175
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,989
That's really manipulative, isn't it?

176
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
-Yes, it is.
-Right?

177
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,328
He's not awkwardly trying with the girls,

178
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,208
that's not... quite... right... is it?

179
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,377
He didn't say that, he didn't say that.

180
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,878
He didn't say anything like that.

181
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,297
A stubborn one.

182
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,633
Stubborn has nothing to do with it.

183
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,136
It was in the background
while all the drama was going on,

184
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,555
but Uchi did tell his coworker
he's narrowed it down to one girl.

185
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,682
-Who is it?
-I wonder who it could be.

186
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,268
Maybe it's Yuriko.

187
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,895
Then all the guys like Yuriko.

188
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,439
You're right.

189
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:10,110
I'm telling you, she's an absolute vixen.
Toward men.

190
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,861
Why is she a vixen?

191
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,988
-She's not a vixen.
-Everyone finds her attractive.

192
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,407
She wants to look good
in front of everyone!

193
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,367
She's not!

194
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,787
We've established she only sees
Mr. Ticket as Mr. Ticket.

195
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,665
So the guys
just misunderstand her actions.

196
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,500
That's right.

197
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,211
But since he says he's narrowed it down
to one at that moment,

198
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,964
it must mean we should be able to find out
who she is soon.

199
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,633
-I wanna know!
-I wanna know!

200
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,260
Shall we continue?

201
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,263
{\an8}NAKAMEGURO, TOKYO

202
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,556
{\an8}TORIGOYA MAIN SHOP

203
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,266
{\an8}TORIGOYA
HAKATA MOTSU NABE

204
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,393
{\an8}Hey, hey, hey. He's here.

205
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,936
{\an8}Hey, hey, hey.

206
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,522
I went toward the Higashiyama line
by mistake.

207
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,482
-That way?
-Yeah, that way.

208
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,650
I barely made it.

209
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,861
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

210
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,280
Can you drink?

211
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,324
Let's go for it today.

212
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,701
All right!

213
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,745
Cheers!

214
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,373
There were a bunch of messages on Twitter.

215
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,710
"There are people
who can never get results,

216
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,628
no matter how hard they work.

217
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,548
To put people like that down,

218
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,467
the two of you are total jerks.

219
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,387
It was really painful."
Those were the comment.

220
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,597
For real?

221
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,681
That's a one-sided view.

222
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,351
Uchi's got a strong heart.

223
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,811
I like to think
that I'm mentally pretty strong too.

224
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,896
I've been bashed on too many times before.

225
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,483
Before? You mean, like, at work?

226
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,236
Your first year as a stylist,

227
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,779
you're seriously treated like dirt.

228
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,532
It was ramen every day.

229
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,034
-Really.
-For real?

230
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,579
Yeah, I really had no money.
The salary was terrible.

231
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,373
Like 100,000 yen.

232
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:51,253
Uchi, you sleep all over
the place, don't you?

233
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,880
Last time, you were sleeping by the pool.

234
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,509
I think no one should sleep
in the living room.

235
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,635
Why not?

236
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,305
No one can use the living room
if someone's sleeping in there.

237
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,768
The living room should be a public space.

238
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,478
-I suppose.
-Yeah.

239
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,313
Has Makocchan made a move?

240
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,190
Move?

241
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,859
So...

242
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,655
since I went on a date with Uchi,

243
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,283
we haven't really talked.

244
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,911
So no, not really.

245
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:30,375
So, Mizuki and I talked at the café.

246
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,256
-It's okay, right?
-Yeah, but...

247
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,758
Well, if things have changed.

248
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,804
It's a while ago now, but in the beginning

249
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,931
we all liked Makocchan.

250
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,310
And a lot has happened,

251
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,021
but Makocchan was...

252
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,775
Well, maybe it wasn't
to the level of "like" yet,

253
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,986
but he was on my mind.

254
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,575
But I thought that maybe he likes Minori.

255
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,078
So I was talking about that
with Mizuki at the café.

256
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,333
But I think my feelings have changed.

257
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:19,090
Lately, everyone's been up
pretty late, right?

258
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,635
Sometimes I wonder if it's okay for him.

259
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,721
Yeah, he's got early morning practice...

260
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
Which he goes to, right?

261
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,308
Yeah, he said he's gonna be serious
about baseball...

262
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,894
-He came to tell us that.
-Yeah, he came to tell us.

263
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,065
After that, for about three days,
he went to sleep early.

264
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,026
So I thought
he was being good about it, but...

265
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,321
When I get up to go to school,
I've seen Makocchan sleeping...

266
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,368
more often than not.

267
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:51,456
I've told him
that I want to go watch him play.

268
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,292
But when I told him
that maybe I could bring everyone,

269
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,420
he said he was taken off the bench,

270
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,338
so he has to practice.

271
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,925
He says he eats mostly protein,

272
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,178
but lately I've seen him eating snacks.

273
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,180
-And he's been drinking.
-He has been.

274
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,936
It can't help but make me think,
"Maybe he's not who I thought he was."

275
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,482
How's baseball going?

276
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,528
Baseball...

277
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,155
Actually, the league games
have already started.

278
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,908
I'm trying...

279
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,619
But I get elbow pain.

280
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,496
So with that...

281
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,958
I guess, your lifestyle at home...

282
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,962
The smoking and drinking.

283
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,425
The late-night snacking,

284
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:47,011
it's a little discomforting to be honest.

285
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,807
You said you were going to work hard,
a month ago or whatever,

286
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,685
that you were aiming
to be a starting pitcher.

287
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,520
I can't help but feel...

288
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,525
that your actions don't match your words.

289
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,277
Well, I do go to practice.

290
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,073
But, yeah...

291
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,700
It's okay if you don't make it.

292
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,161
If there was evidence of your effort,

293
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,706
I'd think that's great.

294
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,293
So no matter how things would go for you,

295
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,880
we'd say, "Well, Makoto worked hard."

296
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,467
Or that's what we want to be able to say.

297
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,510
Yeah...

298
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,262
So there's another month and a half?

299
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,973
About a month.

300
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,891
I hope you work hard.

301
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,268
Yeah.

302
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,813
If you're gonna do it, do it.
If not, then don't.

303
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,897
You should just make it clear.

304
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,568
If you're just wavering,
the month is just gonna go by.

305
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,071
I should be doing more.

306
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,907
I do think about it.

307
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,495
I think that just thinking about it
is too late at this point.

308
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,162
You just gotta do it.

309
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,914
That's what I think.

310
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,004
{\an8}TEIKYO UNIVERSITY
ITABASHI, TOKYO

311
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,104
Looks tasty.

312
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,816
-Ruriko, where did you get up to for CV--
-QV?

313
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,235
{\an8}RINKO UEDA, 4TH YEAR MED STUDENT
RURIKO FUJIKURA, 4TH YEAR MED STUDENT

314
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,444
{\an8}I'm kind of disorganized about it.

315
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,198
{\an8}I'd do some of it, and then get stuck
on the last part, so I'd stop.

316
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,659
I'd do some and stop again.

317
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,826
I totally understand.

318
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,245
I only did as much as I could explain.

319
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,371
Really?

320
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,456
When do you study, Yuriko?

321
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,125
Can you study at home?

322
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,919
Not too much, I think.

323
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003
So it is hard to study there.

324
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:48,340
I try to hang out with the other members
when I have time.

325
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,717
That's true.

326
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,554
What about the guys?

327
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,556
You mean, who I like?

328
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,641
The one I like the most right now,

329
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,144
is the sporty guy called Makocchan.

330
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,021
-The baseball guy.
-The pitcher!

331
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,983
He's the pitcher.
But I've never gone on a date with him.

332
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,985
But you want to?

333
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,238
It's actually really
questionable right now.

334
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,323
Borderline?

335
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,828
I think he's into Minori.

336
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,914
-Is that the feeling you get?
-Totally.

337
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,165
I see.

338
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:27,004
The tap dancer guy too,
he's asked me out a bunch of times.

339
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,840
He's easy to talk to.

340
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,507
-He's good?
-He's...

341
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,262
This is fun.

342
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,183
I'm not sure.
I do want to go out with him again.

343
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,062
You don't want to make a move?

344
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,608
I've never asked anyone out before--

345
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,025
Right, you've said that.

346
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,654
Maybe it's a good opportunity.
What should I do?

347
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,364
Okay, I'll try asking.

348
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,159
-You're gonna ask?
-I'm gonna ask.

349
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,587
I'm back.

350
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,255
Welcome back.

351
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,640
-Want to know what I got today?
-What's that?

352
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,934
A roll cake. Want some?

353
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,060
I'll have some.

354
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,896
Welcome back, Yuki.

355
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,689
-Thanks.
-What's that?

356
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,940
Do you want some roll cake?

357
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,525
Yes, thank you.

358
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,903
-Ouch.
-Sorry, sorry.

359
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,907
The kid is awake.

360
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,367
Welcome back!

361
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,911
Thanks, I'm back.

362
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,621
Quiet entrance.

363
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,873
-Don't wake the kid.
-Yes, don't.

364
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,208
-Okay.
-Our kid is sleeping.

365
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,501
Wow.

366
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,254
-What were you guys up to?
-Nothing.

367
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,424
-What should be...
-The topic of discussion?

368
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,637
Today? Well, let's see...

369
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,848
I did want to talk about
what we talked about yesterday.

370
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,977
But someone seems to be knocked out
on the living room couch.

371
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,774
About not sleeping on the couch.

372
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,693
I agree with that too.

373
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:16,030
It's become hard to have
an "on" and "off" in this house.

374
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,406
I see.

375
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,201
Our kid's asleep.
Should I wake her?

376
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,328
Should we settle
the living room issue today?

377
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,164
-Should we settle it today?
-Should we?

378
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,791
Hey, kid.

379
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,918
-I'll wake her.
-Nice!

380
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,753
You startled me.

381
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,923
-It's too cute.
-If you try to wake her like that...

382
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,675
Kid, go sleep upstairs.

383
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,551
What? What?

384
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,471
-Hey, kid, we've got a serious problem.
-Welcome back.

385
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,723
What is it?

386
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,850
-We're talking about the living room--
-I want some!

387
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:48,437
-Oh, sure.
-Here, you can eat first.

388
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,483
You can eat first, but we do have
a living room situation right now.

389
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,567
What? What?

390
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,945
We should all sleep in our beds.

391
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,824
The living room is the living room,
and over there is where we eat.

392
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,369
If we could do that, then I...

393
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,955
Let's stop sleeping in the living room.

394
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,039
Okay...

395
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,042
Hey, you, don't try going back to sleep.

396
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,753
No, I was gonna go upstairs.

397
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,295
-Bad girl.
-Go to sleep.

398
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,007
Good night!

399
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,676
She's definitely going to come back down.

400
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,595
You should keep watch for tonight.

401
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,075
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

402
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,286
I'm sorry, those were my dishes.

403
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,913
-It's fine.
-I'll do it.

404
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,831
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,836
-Were you able to sleep?
-What?

406
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,963
-Were you able to sleep?
-I was.

407
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,757
-I'll wash.
-What?

408
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,259
-These. I used them yesterday.
-No worries.

409
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:01,928
But...

410
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,601
I was worried you couldn't sleep.
Was it hard?

411
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,812
-It wasn't hard.
-You're okay?

412
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,481
-Sorry.
-It's fine. It's totally fine.

413
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,360
-I did kind of think it bothered you.
-No way.

414
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,698
You were really spread open out there,
so I just wondered if it was okay for you.

415
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,576
Was it painful to see?

416
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,580
If you can sleep in your bed,
there's nothing better.

417
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,291
-Are you okay? Anything else?
-Nothing at all.

418
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,878
Nothing else at all.
What about you?

419
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,967
Just girl problems?
Not even that?

420
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,052
No girl problems.

421
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,223
Today, well...
I'm just...

422
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,308
Just tired from stuff.

423
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,977
-What?
-Tired from stuff.

424
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,229
Tired from stuff?

425
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:00,277
Man, the guys hung out.
Uchi's pretty outspoken.

426
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:04,365
-And his arguments are totally sound.
-Completely.

427
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:09,245
Making starting pitcher with just
another month left seems impossible.

428
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,831
He was told he should practice,

429
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,416
but he says, "Well, I've got elbow pain."

430
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,336
At that moment,
I knew that this guy's no good.

431
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,174
Every athlete has
some injury all the time--

432
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,259
Everyone's in pain.

433
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,512
You rest if you can't move,
pain is just a norm.

434
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,390
Tap should have gotten angrier there--

435
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,183
Yeah, I thought he would have said more.

436
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,395
Yeah, instead of the living room issue,

437
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,149
he should've put greater focus
to the guys' issues.

438
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,276
As the oldest, he should've taken the lead

439
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,945
-and said, "Hey, let's talk this through."
-That's right.

440
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,117
Maybe it has to do with the tweets.

441
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,746
-Because he was bashed.
-He can't say things too strongly now.

442
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,457
-He got scared.
-That's weak! Weak!

443
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,502
To back down
just for that level of Twitter bashing...

444
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,879
Coming from someone who's involved

445
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,673
in some top-class
celebrity Twitter battles,

446
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,133
that's a little--

447
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,884
If he's in shock
because of those little sparks,

448
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,386
it would be instant death for me.

449
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,141
In shock because of those little embers?
That's weak!

450
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,103
In that sense, Mishin here,

451
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,397
he knows all that.

452
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,232
But he's still like,

453
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,569
"I've taken bashings before,
so I'll be fine."

454
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,612
Well, people who've really worked hard

455
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,325
aren't really affected by
attacks like that on social media.

456
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,910
That's true,
they know they've put in the work.

457
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:37,374
They have confidence. It doesn't matter
what some losers say on social media.

458
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,001
What we can talk about is
how he's gained some points.

459
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,752
It's annoying!

460
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,964
But he's really the one reasonable person.

461
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,881
-Yes.
-That's true.

462
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,801
So now it's about
who he's going to choose--

463
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,761
One vote for Yuriko!

464
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,930
-Damn! Why did I...
-Oh, Yuriko...

465
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,474
I'm so annoyed.
I wanted to bad-mouth him.

466
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,310
I've already declared
how much I hated him on YouTube.

467
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,187
{\an8}Did you dye your hair, Mizuki?

468
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,688
{\an8}I did! On my own.

469
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,398
{\an8}-On your own?
-Color Butter?

470
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,234
-Yeah, Color Butter.
-Really?

471
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:07,196
-It's cute.
-Really? Uchi is busy, so.

472
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,157
-You're gonna have Uchi color it?
-Yeah. So until then,

473
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,492
I'll dye it.

474
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,036
Yes?

475
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,167
-Hey!
-Welcome back.

476
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,252
Did you just get home?

477
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,087
-Yeah, just now.
-Welcome home.

478
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,467
-Come in, come in.
-Join the girl circle.

479
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,428
-I kind of want to talk to Minori.
-Sure, go ahead.

480
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,348
-Should we leave then?
-No, no.

481
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,392
-We'll go downstairs.
-Should I come?

482
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,647
-I'm gonna borrow her for a minute.
-Of course. See you later.

483
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,195
-What's going on? What's happening?
-I wonder what it is.

484
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,406
-I wonder...
-Is something there, you think?

485
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,910
-I think so.
-Right? I thought so too.

486
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,510
-Is this what the chairs are for?
-It's the first time I've sat in these.

487
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,597
Kind of awesome.

488
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,726
-So, what?
-What?

489
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,938
I was thinking...

490
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,858
that...

491
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,238
I want to ask you out.

492
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,074
-A date?
-A date.

493
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,283
Part two?

494
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,411
I want to talk to you again.

495
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,497
Okay.

496
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,335
-Is it okay?
-It's okay.

497
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,545
-Okay? That was easy.
-Is that bad?

498
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,340
No, it's good. Well, you know...

499
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:53,427
I'm kind of nervous.

500
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,599
-What is this?
-Yeah, you're acting different than usual.

501
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,976
I'm nervous.

502
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,060
That's so weird.

503
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,611
Say something.

504
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,989
-It's uncomfortable!
-Is it?

505
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,199
Yes.

506
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,411
We'll go somewhere in Chichibu.

507
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,580
-Chichibu? And?
-Chichibu.

508
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,874
Details to follow.

509
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,126
-To follow?
-To follow.

510
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,085
-To look forward to?
-To look forward to.

511
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,338
Okay.

512
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,883
I'm glad.

513
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,844
Why? Did you think I'd say no?

514
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,638
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't.

515
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,432
-I didn't think you'd say no, but...
-That's confident.

516
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:45,396
But this is the most nervous
I've felt since I've been here.

517
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,531
-I'm gonna go tell the girls.
-Okay.
