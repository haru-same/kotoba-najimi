00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:11,094
We offer our deepest condolence
to Yosuke Imai in remembrance of his life,

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,764
who loved and was loved by many.

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,065
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,776
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,360
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,072
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,365
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,202
{\an8}There is no script at all.

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:41,542
{\an8}Let's see, last time, Makoto left
and a new member, Arman, arrived.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,836
Arman!

11
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,130
Your Japanese is so good.
Have you lived in Japan before?

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,051
{\an8}I lived here until I was ten,
and then I lived in Hawaii for 15 years.

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,219
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,096
Wait, you're not half?
You're from--

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,806
-I'm half.
-Half Japanese and...

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,099
Japanese and Iranian.

17
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,729
Surfing, boogie-boarding.
I also kickbox.

18
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,938
You seem strong.

19
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,900
I hope to teach English
while I'm in Japan.

20
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,236
<i>-He's so cool.</i>
<i>-He's from Hawaii.</i>

21
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,156
Netflix is really international.

22
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,620
You plug Netflix
at least once per episode.

23
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,414
-I'm just expressing my feelings.
-That's a little unfair.

24
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,836
I'm just explaining
how Netflix offers shows globally.

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,383
Also, it gives you perfect recommendations
depending on what you watch.

26
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,260
So sneaky.

27
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,805
You're in on it with Netflix, aren't you?

28
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,225
I went to the marketing meeting
for two days.

29
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,146
He's attractive.
You're into him, right, Tri?

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,315
He is attractive,
and he seems nice.

31
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,570
It might finally be
the start of something for Mizuki.

32
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,158
-I'm glad.
-That morning scene was great.

33
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,995
{\an8}-That's a cute turtleneck.
-This? Thank you.

34
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,246
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD

35
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,455
{\an8}Are you a model?

36
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,667
{\an8}I work at an office.

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,211
{\an8}-You seem the most like a model.
-Really? Wow.

38
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:13,091
{\an8}I feel like if you give either a push,
they'll get together.

39
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,511
-They just need a trigger.
-I just get that feeling.

40
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,265
And during Arman's welcome party,

41
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,811
well, I don't know if that was
the right time for the announcement.

42
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,939
Ms. Hayata, was it?

43
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,816
So cold to her suddenly.

44
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,319
A wonderful announcement
while stepping all over Adachi's heart.

45
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,530
I believe she smiled the entire time.

46
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,785
So I'm going to tell Tadamichi
how I feel about him again...

47
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,119
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD

48
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,748
{\an8}...and after I tell everyone
how it goes...

49
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,834
{\an8}I'm thinking of leaving.

50
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,794
{\an8}<i>And thanks to Ms. Seina,</i>

51
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:53,006
-Tatsuya and Minori...
-Oh, that's right.

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,510
Yes, Seina, who tends to be blunt,
ends up helping them get together.

53
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,680
-I didn't try hard enough.
-Yeah, you need to push harder.

54
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,640
{\an8}You need to be confident.

55
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,601
{\an8}-Thanks for the advice.
-Oh, of course.

56
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,854
{\an8}-I'll be clearer next time.
-Yes.

57
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:11,900
{\an8}Maybe today they'll make things clear
and start their relationship.

58
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:17,197
-Yeah.
-What if they both say they want to leave?

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,450
It could happen, right,
with how quickly things are progressing?

60
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,334
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD
SINGLE FOR 6 MONTHS

61
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,546
{\an8}ODAIBA, TOKYO

62
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,051
{\an8}Good work.

63
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,595
{\an8}It's cold.

64
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,806
Is your cold better?

65
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,059
No. It just won't get better.

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,520
I go to work and come back late.

67
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,107
The whole country is going to send
their sympathies.

68
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,985
-You work, too.
-It's ending tomorrow, though.

69
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:23,031
-It's good, you got work.
-But it's still not consistent.

70
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,742
-Bon appétit.
-Looks delicious.

71
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,747
-No, I'll do it!
-I'll do it!

72
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,540
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Okay.

73
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,459
Rock, paper, scissors!

74
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,088
Here you go then. Man...

75
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,966
-It's your risotto donburi.
-It brings back memories.

76
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,137
-That was the day summer vacation started.
-Oh, when we went out?

77
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,056
That was fun.
It brings back memories.

78
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,976
Minori, you're...

79
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,811
-I'm hard to read?
-Yeah.

80
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,648
I can't tell what you're thinking now.

81
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,946
That looks fun.
It looks like it feels good.

82
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,408
Wanna walk?

83
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,826
Wanna go for a walk?

84
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,169
-Oh, a sand beach.
-It's not a sandbox.

85
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,546
-Not sandbox, sand beach!
-Oh, the beach.

86
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,714
Sandbox? How silly.

87
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,600
It's cold.

88
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,731
We left things unsettled.

89
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,570
-So I thought I'd make my feelings clear.
-Make them clear?

90
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,074
I really like you, Minori.

91
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,452
So, if you feel the same...

92
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,331
I want you by my side.

93
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:02,339
I knew how you felt
after we went to Chichibu,

94
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,050
and I've thought about it a lot.

95
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,971
I really like you, too.

96
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,434
I want to be true to my feelings.

97
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,562
But...

98
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,941
I'm still not sure.

99
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,070
It's moving a little fast for me.

100
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,406
I want to be surer of my feelings,

101
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,285
so I feel like I can't give you
an answer until then.

102
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,374
I'll figure it out soon.

103
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:44,631
One thing that's been bothering me...

104
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,636
You went out with all three of us.

105
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,101
So it feels like I was
the best choice of the three for you.

106
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,645
So I've wondered about that.

107
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,066
That's not exactly how it is.

108
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,363
Even if I try to say it with words,
you'll probably still...

109
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:13,160
If we continue to live together
and get to know each other better,

110
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,120
if you get to know me better...

111
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,166
-I'm sorry it's taking me so long.
-It's all right.

112
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,793
Should we head home?

113
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,009
Let's go home.

120
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,016
{\an8}So, we went to dinner yesterday.

121
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,478
{\an8}How did it go?

122
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,566
You don't know about this, right, Arman?

123
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,818
In the beginning of September--

124
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,737
-Oh, I heard from Uchi.
-Oh, you did?

125
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,863
That's all I heard, though.

126
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,406
We went on a date.

127
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,743
And Minori enjoyed it.

128
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,372
And they went out a few more times after.

129
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,374
And yesterday they had dinner.

130
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,168
Oh, so that's what happened yesterday.

131
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,796
He asked me to be his girlfriend.

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,553
But I told him I wanted to take more time
and get to know him.

133
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,558
I wonder if he just chose me
out of the three he dated.

134
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,270
-Oh, so that's what you're afraid of.
-Yeah.

135
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,189
It's been bothering me, so I asked him,

136
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:11,819
and he said it'd be better if he showed me
through his actions rather than told me.

137
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,656
That's what he said, anyway.

138
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,618
-But it's still going well?
-Yeah, it's going well.

139
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,996
And you got to communicate your doubts.

140
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,040
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

141
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,252
But I didn't get to hear
his thoughts on that.

142
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,047
Well, he's planning on showing you.

143
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,884
I know Uchi's trying really hard

144
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,388
to go through the proper steps,
but it's hard to feel...

145
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,808
the passion, I guess.

146
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,521
That part's not coming through, I guess.

147
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,400
He's probably the type of guy
who wants the right setting.

148
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,236
Maybe he doesn't want to say those things
unless the setting is right.

149
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,905
He wants to be prepared.

150
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:01,077
You're at a tough point right now,
but it'll be more fun once you're sure.

151
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,038
-Were you able to find a job?
-I haven't heard back yet.

152
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,249
-You're looking?
-Yeah.

153
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,626
-Did you go all over Japan?
-I did.

154
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,963
-"All over Japan."
-You know, kind of approximate, right?

155
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,798
Is there anywhere besides Tokyo
you'd like to see?

156
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,383
Kamakura.

157
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,927
-Or Chiba.
-Both are nice.

158
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,097
Kamakura has a beach, right?
Shonan beach?

159
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,640
-Surfing?
-Can you surf?

160
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,726
-No, I've never done it.
-Do you surf?

161
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,270
-I didn't bring my board.
-You can surf, right, Mizuki?

162
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,564
-Let's rent boards.
-Yeah.

163
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,441
-Let's do it.
-Let's go to Shonan.

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,736
Shonan? Or either one?

165
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,697
-Let's plan the day then.
-Are you usually free on Sundays?

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,074
-Yes.
-Then let's go Sunday.

167
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,701
Okay.

168
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:48,291
Minori told me that she felt like

169
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,712
I might have only chosen her
because there were three of them.

170
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,383
So she feels like she's one out of three.

171
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:01,721
And I couldn't really say then,
"No, you're the only one in the world."

172
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,058
It felt cheap to say it like that.

173
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,312
But she did say things are going well.

174
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,650
Show her how you feel every day.

175
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,943
-You're sure you like her, right?
-Yes, I like her.

176
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,323
She has to feel that from you every day,

177
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,618
and not just on your dates.

178
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:28,540
-Otherwise she might feel uncertain.
-That makes sense.

179
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,249
One more push.

180
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,002
Thanks, Arman.

181
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,258
-I bet Arman would just go for it.
-I'm sure.

182
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,137
Yeah, I would be direct
and express how I feel on dates.

183
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,848
-You're that type.
-Yeah.

184
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:50,312
I used to express by action,
but then I'd wait for the right moment,

185
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,523
and sometimes it'd be too late,
and I'd miss it.

186
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,942
So now I'll say what I feel in the moment.

187
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:00,988
Even if the setting isn't romantic,
I'll just say it.

188
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,116
I'm glad there's a new point of view.

189
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,912
You have what I'm missing, Arman.
It's great.

190
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,459
-It's what Japanese guys aren't good at.
-Yeah.

191
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,628
We're no longer in the Edo period.

192
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,508
We haven't freed
our national isolation of love.

193
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,220
The national isolation of love.
I wish the Perry of love would come.

194
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,099
But the Perry of love is here!
From Hawaii.

195
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,226
Arman is Perry.

196
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,895
It seems like things are moving smoothly
now that Arman is here.

197
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,273
-Yeah.
-Arman seems passionate.

198
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:41,028
-I totally thought they'd kiss at least.
-I thought so, too.

199
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,281
But I guess not yet.

200
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,536
I guess Minori isn't the type
to just jump into a relationship.

201
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,374
But I think that was a legitimate place
to ask her out.

202
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,000
-Completely.
-Right?

203
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,211
The official place of love, Tokyo.

204
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,005
-I didn't realize that existed.
-Of course.

205
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,798
Yeah, it's on the map.

206
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,051
{\an8}Did Governor Masuzoe really approve that?

207
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,177
{\an8}YOICHI MASUZOE
GOVERNOR OF TOKYO

208
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,680
{\an8}"Actually, that's where I asked
Satsuki out."

209
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,973
{\an8}SATSUKI KATAYAMA

210
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,725
{\an8}You don't get to call her "Satsuki."

211
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:17,273
My first date
with my ex-girlfriend was there.

212
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,483
Seriously?

213
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,445
-While working here?
-Well, two and a half years ago.

214
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,156
How'd you end up there?

215
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,493
Well, after work, I was driving
and asked her where she wanted to go,

216
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,370
and we ended up there.

217
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,372
It's like we were sucked in.

218
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,625
I guess that's the power of Tokyo's
official place of love.

219
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,754
But, like Arman was saying,

220
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:44,926
if Uchi doesn't convey his passion soon,

221
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,262
-Minori might just say, "Forget it."
-He might miss the opportunity.

222
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,015
-Right?
-Yeah, it'd be unfortunate.

223
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:56,854
She said "passion," so she does like him.

224
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,818
She just needs to be reassured.
That's probably all she wants.

225
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,152
That's true.

226
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,988
Like, "I'm in love with you!"
kind of thing.

227
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,491
-Totally?
-Totally.

228
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,827
Totally!

229
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,330
-Isn't that a little cheesy?
-It's passion.

230
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,124
She's looking for cheesy.

231
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,335
-Really?
-She wants to feel it.

232
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,922
It seemed like he took
Arman's advice to heart,

233
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,758
so he'll probably go for it
and show his passion for her.

234
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,384
He's a serious guy.

235
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,637
And Mizuki and Arman...

236
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,642
-will be going to Kamakura.
-They've got a date next Sunday.

237
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,729
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

238
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,486
{\an8}-Hello.
-Hello.

239
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,903
It's nice to meet you.

240
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,908
I'd like to try out your gym.

241
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,829
-Do you have reservations?
-Yes, I should.

242
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,415
-Your name please?
-Arman Bitaraf.

243
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,296
{\an8}DAIKI MIYAGI, 25 YEARS OLD,
ACTOR, TARGET SHIBUYA OWNER

244
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,591
{\an8}There you go again.
Oh, hi, perfect.

245
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,094
{\an8}-Hi, I'm Miyagi.
-I'm Arman.

246
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,805
{\an8}-Arman?
-Yes, it's nice to meet you.

247
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,516
{\an8}Hi, I'm Ippei Shima.

248
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,559
{\an8}-Have you done this before?
-Yes, a little.

249
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,688
Those are totally kickboxing shorts.

250
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,483
-I did it for about five years in Hawaii.
-Oh, I see.

251
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,442
Can you stretch a little on your own?

252
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,282
-You kickboxed?
-Um, Muay Thai and a little boxing.

253
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,910
Boxing?
So you were pretty serious then.

254
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,579
It's been two years, though,
so I'm a little rusty.

255
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,873
-Was it a hobby?
-Yes.

256
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,708
Well, I did compete a little...

257
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,669
-Amateur?
-Yes.

258
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,046
-How did you do?
-I was five and one.

259
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,213
That's great!

260
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,465
-You're half?
-Yes.

261
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,677
-Japanese and?
-Iranian.

262
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,762
Iranian? Oh!

263
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,557
You're all over the place.

264
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,017
You're doing Muay Thai,
but you're Iranian...

265
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,019
I'm all confused now.

266
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,940
-I bow to your comedic senses.
-Thanks.

267
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,319
I'm working part-time here,
but I'm also a comedian.

268
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,780
-I lived at <i>Terrace House</i> before.
-Oh, really?

269
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,365
What? You didn't know?

270
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,160
-Do you know about me, though?
-I do.

271
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,580
What? You know him and not me?

272
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,790
I heard you were a champion before.

273
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,459
Let's start.

274
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,961
Let's start light.

275
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,191
Straight hook.

276
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,487
-Okay!
-Thank you.

277
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,615
It would be interesting if you competed.

278
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,575
There's an opening for a match
on December 13th.

279
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,118
-The 13th?
-Yes.

280
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,996
A match in one month might be tough.

281
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,206
Well, if you're serious...

282
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,917
If you can move this much
after a two year gap...

283
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,003
-Okay, I'll try.
-You'll try?

284
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,839
-Let's work at it.
-Thank you.

285
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,133
-Let's work together.
-Pleasure to work with you.

286
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,739
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

287
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,658
-No one else is home?
-No.

288
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,956
-You just finished work?
-Yeah, I was at the office and stuff.

289
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,586
You're washing dishes?
Whose is that?

290
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,964
-I don't know.
-Oh, there's a lot. I'm sorry. Thanks.

291
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,341
-No worries, it was no problem.
-Were you home today?

292
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,220
No, I went to train
for the first time today.

293
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,513
It was fun.

294
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,473
-It was fun?
-It was.

295
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,811
-Done!
-Thanks.

296
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,897
How are things with Uchi?

297
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,818
-With Uchi?
-Did anything change?

298
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,904
Well, it's barely been two days.

299
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,448
It hasn't been very long.

300
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,326
-Has he said anything?
-No, not really.

301
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,620
-No?
-Well, it seemed like he got it.

302
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,083
-You're going out with Mizuki, right?
-Yeah, tomorrow.

303
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,375
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.

304
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,003
-Where are you going?
-To Shonan.

305
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,297
-To surf?
-If there are waves.

306
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,302
-Oh, you will.
-Yeah, if not, maybe just shop around.

307
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,804
Sounds fun.

308
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,440
-I want to go in the ocean.
-Yeah, me too.

309
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,943
But there won't be any waves today.

310
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,528
-Let's go to Chiba next time.
-Yeah!

311
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,447
Sounds fun.

312
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,657
It's been about a week
since you've arrived.

313
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,284
Yeah.

314
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,746
-Have you gotten used to it?
-Yeah.

315
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,580
You blended in pretty quickly.

316
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,793
{\an8}ZENIARAI BENZAITEN UGAFUKU SHRINE
KAMAKURA, KANAGAWA

317
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,255
{\an8}Wow.

318
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,508
It's like old Japan.

319
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,094
This is Japanese style.

320
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,016
What's that?

321
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,352
If you put your head to the smoke,

322
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,355
-it'll make you smarter.
-Really? I'm gonna do it later.

323
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,984
It's for good fortune.

324
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,320
-Like this?
-Yes.

325
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,115
You wash it to purify it.

326
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,751
Hello.

327
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,128
What do you want?

328
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,215
Can I have a Ramune, please?

329
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,926
{\an8}-Two, please.
-Two.

330
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,679
-You don't have to do that!
-It's no problem.

331
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,889
Thank you.

332
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,894
Cheers!

333
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,277
-It's so good!
-It brings back memories.

334
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,197
The marble's in there.

335
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,950
When I was little,
I'd break the bottle to get it.

336
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,120
-I'm kinda hungry.
-Let's go eat then.

337
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,210
{\an8}-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit!

338
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,420
{\an8}How should I eat this?

339
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,257
{\an8}-It's big.
-Yeah, it's huge.

340
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,976
-It's good.
-It's good?

341
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,518
Want to try some?

342
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,396
Are you sure?

343
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,571
-Good, right?
-Mmm-hmm. Want some of mine?

344
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,539
Yeah, it's good.

345
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,090
Is it hot?

346
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,095
-Oh, it's good.
-What do you want to do after we shop?

347
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,472
If we're in Kamakura,
we have to see the ocean.

348
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,891
Let's go.

349
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,059
Do you think we can catch the sunset?

350
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,062
{\an8}KAMAKURA

351
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,688
{\an8}It's so cute!

352
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
These look warm.

353
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,781
Which ones do you like?

354
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,118
-Maybe this?
-A knit...

355
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,287
This is good.

356
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,414
{\an8}-What do you think?
-Gray.

357
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,706
{\an8}Gray?

358
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,417
Ready?

359
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,088
-What do you think?
-It looks good!

360
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,090
It fits you perfectly.

361
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,716
Will you try this one, too?

362
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,428
-That's cute. Maybe too cute.
-It is.

363
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,596
And this one too.

364
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,977
-What do you think?
-It looks good!

365
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,688
-It's warm.
-Is it?

366
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,945
-And?
-That one looks good, too.

367
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,696
Which do you like better?

368
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,115
I might like the gray better.

369
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:32,119
{\an8}YUIGAHAMA BEACH, KAMAKURA

370
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,579
{\an8}The ocean!

371
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,460
{\an8}-It's so pretty!
-This beach is nice.

372
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,712
But there are no waves at all!

373
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,506
-Should we stick our feet in?
-Should we?

374
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,508
We should.

375
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,095
It looks cold!

376
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,596
The sand is cold.

377
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,515
It feels better than I expected.

378
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,227
It's freezing!

379
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,939
It feels good!

380
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,109
It's so clear.

381
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,487
It's clearer than I expected.

382
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,200
This is nice.

383
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,539
Ready?

384
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,964
-How is it?
-It looks good.

385
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,262
It's so beautiful.

386
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,935
-I had fun today.
-Me too. Thank you for bringing me.

387
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,607
Do you have plans on December 13th?

388
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,234
No.

389
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,903
At the gym I went to yesterday...

390
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,490
I want to compete once in Japan
as an amateur.

391
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,493
-You're going to compete?
-I'm thinking about it.

392
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:59,415
I was practicing with Miyagi,
and he said I should enter a match.

393
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,749
-On the 13th?
-The 13th.

394
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,293
-I'll leave it open.
-Come see my match.

395
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,919
I'm looking forward to it.

396
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,964
Once training and work starts,
I'll be busy.

397
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,758
You'll be productive.

398
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,138
They're perfect for each other!

399
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,014
It's perfect!

400
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,768
So perfect.

401
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,562
Why isn't Glasses over there applauding?

402
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,068
She was acting so cutesy!

403
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,946
She actually had her hands here
while she said, "That looks good, too!"

404
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,115
What's wrong with that?

405
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,827
Everyone does that. Everyone!

406
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,620
-Everyone?
-Everyone.

407
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,372
-That's a good change.
-That's right.

408
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,623
-Really?
-Yes.

409
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,251
-It becomes that apparent?
-Yeah.

410
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,630
Wow. Well, it was interesting.
It kinda made me laugh.

411
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,717
Which part?

412
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,305
She was shouting at the ocean,
"The ocean!"

413
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,640
They had a good vibe at the shop.

414
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:06,148
It was definitely not the sort of vibe
just friends would have.

415
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:11,862
It only happens
when there's mutual interest.

416
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,991
That initial lovey-doveyness,
I want that for the rest of my life.

417
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,244
I completely understand.

418
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:23,207
It's one of the best moments
in a relationship.

419
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,127
-You want just the fatty part of the tuna.
-That's right!

420
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,462
You want to catch the tuna,
take the fatty part,

421
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,672
and move on to the next tuna.

422
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,717
-What do you think, Ayumu?
-It makes me nervous.

423
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,264
If she sees him at his match,
she's caught.

424
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,933
-Daiki and...
-Yes, Hana Imai.

425
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,521
{\an8}It'll be a reenactment
of that scene with them.

426
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,898
{\an8}Man, guys from Hawaii move quick.

427
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,900
What? Nothing's happened yet.

428
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:54,946
He just said
he was going to compete for fun.

429
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,994
Arman's got that kinda cool,
kinda shy thing going for him.

430
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,330
Yeah, it's not too much.

431
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:08,419
That "this is fun" kind of thing.
It's just the right balance.

432
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,837
It's so good.

433
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,215
That was a good date!

434
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,634
I wanna see that again!

435
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,846
You know, you can replay in Netflix.

436
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,684
Oh, man, you're still going on about that?

437
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,061
Because you said you wanted
to see it again.

438
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,729
So I'm just letting you know,

439
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,357
with Netflix,
you can replay it whenever you want.

440
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:34,152
I think I need to check
if we're getting paid the same amount.

441
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,407
It seems he's bought a house recently.

442
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,242
Oh, stop.

443
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,245
The new season of <i>Terrace House</i>
should be at your place.

444
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,371
That's right!

445
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,583
-My parents live there, too.
-That's fine.

446
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,126
The food scenes will have
lots of stewed vegetables.

447
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:54,631
-That's delicious.
-Sure, if the studio wants to do it.

448
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,553
{\an8}-Are you nervous?
-I am.

449
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,013
I wonder how it'll turn out.

450
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,226
I was just thinking about
what I should say.

451
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,854
I've been thinking about it a lot.

452
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,316
I'm sure he's thinking about it, too.

453
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,071
-Well, I just have to hear what he says.
-That's right.

454
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:22,784
-Add the barrette, and it's done!
-Thank you!

455
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,162
Okay.

456
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,168
{\an8}NAKAMEGURO, TOKYO

457
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,599
It's wet.

458
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,358
-Long time no see.
-It's good to see you again.

459
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,403
{\an8}TADAMICHI KAWANO, M.D.
YURIKO'S EX-BOYFRIEND

460
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,945
{\an8}Did you get a tan?

461
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,490
A little.

462
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,034
-A little.
-You got pretty dark.

463
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,787
-From Hawaii?
-Yeah.

464
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,455
How were exams?

465
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,750
-I think they went well.
-That's great!

466
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,754
Wow, so you were able to study?

467
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,466
-Yeah, I studied pretty hard.
-I see.

468
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:26,181
If your exams went well,
then you get to relax.

469
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,766
It's summer vacation.

470
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,728
I still have the CBTs,
so I still have to study.

471
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,523
Well, you still have a month...

472
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,987
So, I have something to tell you.

473
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,074
Tomorrow...

474
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,244
I'll be leaving <i>Terrace House.</i>

475
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,039
Is it because of me?

476
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:57,338
Since my internship will be starting
in December,

477
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,673
I felt like, as a medical student,

478
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:05,136
it wouldn't really be appropriate for me
to treat patients in hospital

479
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:11,352
while living in <i>Terrace House.</i>

480
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,438
That's the reason I'll be leaving.

481
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:19,318
Last time we went out,
I told you how I felt.

482
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:24,865
I told you then
that I couldn't forget you.

483
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,368
So it's not your fault.

484
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:32,998
It's something I decided for myself,
so you don't have to worry about it.

485
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,877
I'd just like to know
your honest feelings.
