1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,681
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,433
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,018
{\an8}SIX STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
LIVING TOGETHER

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,896
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,566
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,569
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,737
{\an8}Let's see, a lot happened last week...

8
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,406
{\an8}-It did last week.
-It did.

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,200
{\an8}You have feelings for each other,

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,204
{\an8}but to be secretive about it
because of your career...

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,373
{\an8}is the biggest problem.

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,834
{\an8}Yeah.

13
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,629
{\an8}I couldn't help but think about the fact

14
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,880
{\an8}that my actions would be seen.

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,883
{\an8}I felt now wasn't the right time
for us to be together.

16
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,010
{\an8}RIKO NAGAI, 18 YEARS OLD
HAYATO TERASHIMA, 29 YEARS OLD

17
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,930
{\an8}But I still like her, so things happened.

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:01:01,186
{\an8}Conscious of their TV image,
they hid what they were really doing.

19
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,691
{\an8}-But Hayato was running, right?
-Yes, that's right.

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,236
{\an8}I was okay with going out with you.

21
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,779
{\an8}But...

22
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:15,533
{\an8}When you said we shouldn't go out
because of my career...

23
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,662
{\an8}I thought maybe you were
just running away.

24
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,666
{\an8}I need to focus on
my chef training.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,461
{\an8}It's just when I thought about
what I really need to do right now...

26
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,839
{\an8}for me, you didn't come first.

27
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,508
{\an8}You told me how much you like me.

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,219
{\an8}But to say I'm not first for you...

29
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,221
{\an8}To put a number on it...

30
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,599
{\an8}I'm going now.

31
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,353
{\an8}-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, bye.

32
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,064
{\an8}So for Riko as long as he felt the same,

33
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,526
she did what she did because
she was okay with going out with him.

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,820
She shared her honest feelings,

35
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,823
but what she got was,
"We should focus on work."

36
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,493
He told her she wasn't his first priority.

37
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,913
Riko just said, "Bye."

38
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:06,001
-That "bye" carried weight.
-Yes, it did.

39
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,544
And at the end...

40
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,588
Arman, on their second date,

41
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,926
told Masako how he felt about her.

42
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,637
{\an8}It's fun being with you.

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,306
{\an8}Will you go out with me?

44
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,349
{\an8}I like you too, probably.

45
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,475
{\an8}I like you.

46
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,521
{\an8}But you're going back to Hawaii.

47
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,774
{\an8}That bothers me.

48
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,567
{\an8}I have things
I need to take care of there.

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,237
{\an8}If we went out for a month

50
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,783
{\an8}and if I felt like I can't leave,
then I won't leave.

51
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,868
{\an8}-You like me that much?
-That much.

52
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:44,247
{\an8}-He has things to take care of in Hawaii?
-I wonder what it is?

53
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,458
Maybe he has to take care of sea turtles.

54
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,543
He probably has a sea turtle friend.

55
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,088
-A sea turtle?
-It comes when Arman calls.

56
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,882
That's so cute!

57
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,593
-I want him to go home soon, then.
-Right?

58
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,054
So they've fallen for each other?

59
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,556
She did put ointment on him.

60
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,640
Oh, yes, the ointment...

61
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,935
Truly a lucky break.

62
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,187
Wasn't it?

63
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,858
-This is how they came up with the saying.
-That's right.

64
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,360
Maybe he purposefully got run over.

65
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,863
For the great payoff.

66
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,322
-And everyone...
-Yes?

67
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,201
...including tonight,
there's only two weeks left.

68
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,788
-That's right.
-Next week is the final episode.

69
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,750
I thought it'd go on forever.

70
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,584
-Should we do it on our own then?
-Should we?

71
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,337
-Yeah...
-We can each bring a member.

72
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,298
We can all pitch in to rent a place.

73
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,633
We should do it.

74
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,805
{\an8}It's been awhile since anyone's said
anything like that to me.

75
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,432
{\an8}I see.

76
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,438
What worried me the most
was that you're going to Hawaii.

77
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,065
It was a barrier.

78
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,441
But what you said...

79
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,446
Your response was above and beyond,

80
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,615
it made me really happy.

81
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,286
You don't seem like you're serious...

82
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,915
but you actually think about everyone.

83
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,834
That's why I like you.

84
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,383
That's what I like about you.

85
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,136
It made me want to believe in you.

86
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,308
-So, you'll go out with me?
-Yes, that's what I mean.

87
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,770
Don't stare at me!

88
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,023
-Seriously?
-Yes.

89
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,735
-Seriously?
-Cheers!

90
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,612
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

91
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,116
I'm really happy.

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,619
No, no. I'm so embarrassed
I can't talk today.

93
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,998
-So that's it for today.
-What?

94
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,502
-You're cute.
-No.

95
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,442
{\an8}-Welcome home.
-We're back.

96
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,904
{\an8}Welcome back.
You're looking stylish today.

97
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,073
You're wearing a button-down.

98
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,743
-Welcome... I'm back, I meant.
-Welcome back.

99
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,333
-Was it fun?
-It was fun.

100
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,417
Where'd you go?

101
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,878
-On a boat.
-Nice.

102
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,046
It's subtle,
but you're touching each other.

103
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,261
His feet and thigh was brushing her.

104
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,722
-We talked...
-There's something on you.

105
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,391
We talked...

106
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,809
And now--

107
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,153
That was too forced!

108
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,031
Wait, what?

109
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,658
Do it again!

110
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,493
Wait. What happened, Arman?

111
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,827
-What?
-What happened?

112
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,872
Nothing, I just told her how I feel
and now we're going out.

113
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,332
Yeah!

114
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,669
-Nice!
-Congratulations!

115
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,380
You worked out that issue?

116
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,382
Oh, yeah.

117
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,675
We talked about that, too.

118
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,929
His answer went above and beyond
the issue.

119
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,139
That's why I agreed to going out.

120
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,435
It really made me see him as a man.

121
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,437
It made me like him even more.

122
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,190
Nice!

123
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,483
-I'm really happy for you, Arman.
-Yeah.

124
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,652
-At the very end.
-Right?

125
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,237
It's really near the end.

126
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,364
-It was a good day.
-Yeah.

127
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,700
It'll only get better.

128
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,784
Yeah.

129
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,307
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD,

{\an8}GAIENMAE, TOKYO

136
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,506
I've told you about Riko and me, right?

137
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,926
{\an8}So since then Riko and I talked.

138
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,472
She said I'm using work as an escape.

139
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,769
She told me she was disappointed with me.

140
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,522
{\an8}How do you really feel about Riko?

141
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,648
{\an8}JUNTA ISHIKAWA
OWNER/CHEF

142
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,191
I like her.

143
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,693
I like her...

144
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,821
and I wish we could go back
to how we were.

145
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,993
Simply put.

146
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,953
What's important to you, right now?

147
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,456
In your mind.

148
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,584
Is it to think of her future
and take a step back?

149
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,754
Is that your way of caring for her?

150
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,839
Both for her and for yourself, of course.

151
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,343
Do you already have an answer
for what you think is best?

152
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,929
The members I've betrayed...

153
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,765
No, the members you've betrayed,

154
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,103
without all that, it's about what you
can really do for Riko.

155
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,480
What's important is what you want to do.

156
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,650
-A lot was going through my mind then.
-I understand.

157
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,194
About our work and everything.

158
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,611
Without all that...

159
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,989
Man and woman.
Person and person.

160
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,909
If I think of it that way...

161
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,830
then I've never changed.
I like her.

162
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,582
I want to be with her.

163
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,585
You do it because you like her.

164
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,503
As long as that feeling
isn't communicated,

165
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,797
Riko won't understand,
no matter what you do.

166
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,469
In the end,
it's about how you feel about the person.

167
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,762
Only that.

168
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:20,268
When you're able to convey that to her,
then she'll be able to give you an answer.

169
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,774
{\an8}I got the job I auditioned for last week.

170
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,361
{\an8}-Oh, wow!
-Seriously? Congrats!

171
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,695
{\an8}-Congratulations.
-High-five!

172
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,199
I'm filming tomorrow.
Oh, I stuttered.

173
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,494
-It's like Misaki.
-You're talking like me!

174
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,995
-We're on a roll.
-Yeah, wow.

175
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,165
Misaki got a job, Martha got a job...

176
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,251
Starting tomorrow night...

177
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,712
Five, six, seven, eight...
I won't be back until the eighth.

178
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,172
-For what?
-Why?

179
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,007
For a job back in my hometown.

180
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,842
You're going to be gone for four days.

181
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,511
I'm pretty sad.

182
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,722
-Yeah.
-I'll work hard.

183
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,557
-Oh, he's back.
-Welcome back.

184
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,268
-Welcome back, you're late.
-I'm back.

185
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,937
-You're back late today.
-Yeah.

186
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,523
-Welcome back.
-I'm exhausted.

187
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,607
Welcome back.

188
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,320
Is your cold better, Riko?

189
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,696
It's better.

190
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,115
Your voice sounds funny.

191
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,199
Still?

192
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,410
Yeah, maybe.

193
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,122
Can we talk later?

194
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,206
Yeah.

195
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,044
Should we go?

196
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,629
No, we'll leave.

197
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,967
-I'm borrowing Riko.
-Sure.

198
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,221
-Is the guys' room okay?
-Yeah.

199
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,810
What are they going to talk about?

200
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,312
I wonder.

201
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,483
Well, we said all we could.

202
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,777
I do wonder though.

203
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,488
But going by that tone,
something may happen.

204
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,366
-You think?
-Yeah.

205
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,203
We talked before, right?

206
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,164
I really felt that way at the time.

207
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,042
I was thinking about our jobs.

208
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,004
And about your future.

209
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,131
I was thinking of too many things.

210
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,219
That's why I did the things I did.

211
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,972
Having said what I did...

212
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,685
I was going to leave the house.

213
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:34,402
That was my way of taking responsibility
after thinking about it at the time.

214
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,364
But after you told me you were
disappointed with me.

215
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,828
I'm sorry I made you feel sad.

216
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:51,043
When I think about just you and me...

217
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,921
I do like you.

218
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,174
That's the truth.

219
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:04,140
It wasn't like I was half-thinking it,
and came close to you.

220
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:12,440
And with all that's happened,
it might be hard to believe me.

221
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,488
I'm sure you're feeling confused.

222
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,073
But I...

223
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,952
want to be with you.

224
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,329
I like you.

225
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,294
I hope we can...

226
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,922
laugh together again.

227
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,845
That's how I feel.

228
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,267
Because you're the person I like...

229
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,438
I was hurt.

230
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,402
I want to believe you, but...

231
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,032
I can't.

232
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,076
Not right now.

233
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,413
I...

234
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,125
want to hang out with you again.

235
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,590
And if I can get your trust back,

236
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,550
I want to go out with you.

237
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,887
I don't...

238
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,102
need an answer right away.

239
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,021
So...

240
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:40,111
Next week...
Next week, on Monday,

241
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,199
in the evening, after work,
I'll wait for you at the restaurant.

242
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,159
You can think it over.

243
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
And if...

244
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,624
you think you can trust me again...

245
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,959
then I want you to come.

246
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,087
Okay.

247
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,049
I'll think it over.

248
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,471
-Thank you.
-Okay.

249
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,015
I'll go now.

250
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,819
He confessed to her again?

251
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,904
-Well, I guess.
-Well, yeah.

252
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,616
But he was going to step back,
because of her career.

253
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,662
Considering work,
they couldn't go out.

254
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,790
-That's why he said what he did.
-I see.

255
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,916
That's what it sounds like.

256
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:40,296
Whether he's being honest or not,
it's up to Riko to decide.

257
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,175
From a female point of view,
has Riko moved on already?

258
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,094
I think she's moved on.

259
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,846
What do you think?

260
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,474
I think it's still 50/50.

261
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,268
-50/50?
-She still has feelings for him.

262
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,187
If Riko...

263
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,773
can emerge from her shell
from this experience,

264
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,443
and then go out, that would be nice.

265
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,154
Because he won't change any time soon.

266
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,575
No, probably not.
It's up to Riko.

267
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,201
I don't approve.

268
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:16,165
But when girls emerge out of their shell,
then it might be too late.

269
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,587
-If that's the case, then it's too late.
-It's too late.

270
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,547
But still, two couples.

271
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,048
-Yeah.
-It's so nice!

272
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:29,386
It's so cute that he tried to kiss her,
but he was rejected. Too cute!

273
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,847
So cute.

274
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,477
So if it had gone well for Terashima,
there would've been three couples.

275
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,853
Happiness all around.

276
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,270
And ending with all couples.

277
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,648
-It could still happen.
-Well, that's true.

278
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,983
You think so?

279
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,651
Are we jumping to Monday now?

280
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,069
Already?

281
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,613
What else is left?

282
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,533
Well, there's couple lovey-dovey time.

283
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,952
I don't know...

284
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,829
if I want to see that.

285
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,671
Going to my hometown for work
for five days. Riko.

286
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,965
{\an8}-It's almost time.
-Yeah.

287
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,970
One week left.

288
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,388
Right?

289
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,307
What are you going to do?

290
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,310
-Me?
-After this.

291
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,065
I'll go back to where I lived before.

292
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,692
-You're going back?
-Yeah.

293
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,902
But...

294
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,905
I'm always asked
if I'm going to live with you.

295
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,073
When the time is right.

296
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,324
After some time.

297
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,702
-Yeah, when the time's right.
-Yeah.

298
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:38,873
I feel like we'll get to know
each other better.

299
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,334
Until now, there was everyone else...

300
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,047
to consider while living here.

301
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,342
I'm sure you've been holding back.

302
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,392
And work, as well.

303
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,352
-We have to work hard.
-What are you going to do about work?

304
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,979
-Oh, my part-time?
-Yeah.

305
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,232
I'll work really hard.

306
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,068
I'll work hard and...

307
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,237
I'll work hard as an entertainer, too

308
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,201
I feel like I can work harder
than ever before.

309
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,580
You've gained something living here.

310
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,083
Even if the environment changes...

311
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,169
my feelings won't change.

312
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,629
So, don't worry.

313
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,091
-Don't change.
-Nothing will change.

314
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:31,968
You'll...

315
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,929
be seeing me still.

316
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,264
You'll be seeing me, too.

317
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,518
{\an8}KAMAKURA, KANAGAWA

318
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,984
{\an8}-Nice work!
-Cheers!

319
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,742
{\an8}HISATO KOJIMA
OWNER

320
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,202
I have an announcement.

321
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,373
I'm going back to Hawaii next month.

322
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,457
Really?

323
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,377
Thank you...

324
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,462
for taking care of me.

325
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,132
Big thanks.

326
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,386
I have one more announcement.

327
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,512
Seriously?

328
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,809
I told you a new girl came, right?

329
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,356
About five days ago, we started going out.

330
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,067
-You have a girlfriend now?
-Yes, I have a girlfriend.

331
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,113
That's a first out of the members
that came to work with us.

332
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,073
They say it's our fault.

333
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,534
They say we hold them back.

334
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,578
It hasn't happened for the last 10.

335
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,289
You're going to Hawaii together?

336
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,042
No, I'd like for her to but...

337
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,046
she has work, so probably not.

338
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,799
So it's already
a long-distance relationship?

339
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,885
-Yeah, it'll be long distance.
-It's all over then.

340
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,554
Don't say that.

341
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,016
I see.

342
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,727
That's so great for you.
At the end, finally.

343
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,812
Yes.

344
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,941
It's sad for us
that <i>Terrace House</i> is ending.

345
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,360
-That means we won't get part-timers.
-That's right.

346
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,074
-It's sad.
-Yeah.

347
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,242
Arman was the hardest worker.

348
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,244
Yeah, he was a hard-worker.

349
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,832
-When you call his name, he'd run over.
-That's true.

350
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,294
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

351
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,672
-I'm glad to have known you.
-Me, too.

352
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,506
Thank you.

353
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,885
I'll be here until September,
so I'll stop in before I leave.

354
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,262
That's right.

355
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,600
{\an8}ANJO, AICHI

356
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,768
{\an8}ANJO TANABATA FESTIVAL
YUKATA COLLECTION 2016

357
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:50,106
{\an8}We have a special guest with us today.

358
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,274
{\an8}Thank you for waiting everyone!

359
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:57,154
{\an8}When I say go,
please yell out "Rikopin!"

360
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,280
Ready?

361
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,741
Go!

362
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,909
Rikopin!

363
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,540
-So cute!
-Hello.

364
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,542
-You're so cute! Hello!
-Rikopin!

365
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,503
-Come this way.
-Here.

366
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,629
I'm coming to you!

367
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,965
-Hello!
-Hello.

368
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,259
There's so many people here to see you.

369
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,803
Really? Thank you so much.

370
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:25,516
Rikopin, you were the winner

371
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,895
in the cutest high school girl
in Japan contest.

372
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,688
-Thank you.
-Oh, there's people waving to you.

373
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,610
And she's currently in <i>Terrace House.</i>

374
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,781
-Is it fun living there?
-Yes, it is.

375
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:44,035
She'll be hosting today.

376
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,579
-Please give her a hand!
-Thank you for having me!

377
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,582
{\an8}GAIENMAE, TOKYO

378
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,300
I talked to Riko.

379
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,763
I told her I'd be waiting for her
here on Monday.

380
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,306
-Monday?
-Yes.

381
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,515
-Here?
-Yes.

382
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,770
-After work, you mean?
-Yes.

383
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,690
I was going to make a summery dessert.

384
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,402
-Is that what you're prepping now?
-Yes.

385
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,614
What's the reasoning behind
having her eat this?

386
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,534
I wanted her to see...

387
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,704
I wanted her to see my work.

388
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:33,167
And if she can't trust me anymore,
she won't come.

389
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,294
-So she may not show?
-Yes.

390
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,090
-Will you taste it for me?
-What?

391
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,174
Will you taste it?

392
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,306
-Oh, man.
-Good?

393
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,557
This is good.

394
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,351
She'll definitely enjoy this.

395
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,560
I enjoy it.

396
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,397
-Seriously, isn't it good?
-Yeah.

397
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,483
-It's definitely good.
-It's good!

398
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,736
Let's make it again and take a picture.

399
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,530
-Should we put it on the summer menu?
-Really?

400
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,698
We can call it the "Riko Special."

401
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,200
That's embarrassing.

402
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,451
Great job.

403
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,078
-It's okay?
-Yeah.

404
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,080
I'll go with this on Monday.

405
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,083
ANJO TANABATA FESTIVAL

406
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,924
{\an8}-Thank you!
-Thank you!

407
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,387
{\an8}Good job.

408
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,471
{\an8}MISAO NAGAI
RIKO'S MOTHER

409
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,140
{\an8}-I'm so tired.
-You are?

410
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,892
-You look cute.
-No way.

411
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,601
You look cute.

412
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,604
-It was hot.
-Was it? Want a break?

413
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,689
-I'm so tired today!
-Good job today.

414
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,652
-The mornings have been early for you.
-Yeah.

415
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,612
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

416
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,572
-Until tomorrow.
-Until tomorrow night.

417
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,700
I told you I'm going straight back
to Tokyo, right?

418
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,536
And after that...

419
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,163
After work...

420
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:59,461
he asked me to come
if I want to be with him.

421
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,631
Are you going?
Or are you not going?

422
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,427
At first...

423
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,139
he said I like you, but let's not go out.

424
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,685
The second time,
he said we both have things to focus on.

425
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:19,606
So it wasn't the right time to go out.

426
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,484
And then this third time,
he says let's go out.

427
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,154
He says something different every time.

428
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,449
It confuses me.

429
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,243
I still like him. But...

430
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,455
I'm very worried.

431
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,415
-You're still 18.
-Yeah.

432
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,501
I think you should date more.

433
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,338
You have to enjoy yourself.

434
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,880
You have to enjoy it.

435
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,299
-Yeah.
-Relationships, I mean.

436
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:51,888
You should really think about it
and decide for yourself.

437
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:52,974
Yeah.

438
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,268
Whether you go tomorrow or not.

439
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,564
I still have some time left.

440
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,733
I'll think it through.

441
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,157
Which do you think it'll be?
Who thinks she'll show?

442
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,576
I think so.

443
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,079
-She'll show either way.
-She'll go.

444
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,541
Of course she should cut him off.

445
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,794
That's what you wish for.

446
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,172
There's no reason for her to like him.

447
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,091
She's liked him from the start.

448
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,761
What your mother says is right.

449
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:36,433
Or for a daughter,
it's good advice to hear.

450
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,436
So he's going to serve dessert

451
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,148
and if he says what he needs to say...

452
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,066
-Yes.
-...there's still a possibility.

453
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,776
It's still possible.

454
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,946
The most entertaining move
would be to drop him, Riko.

455
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,203
It'll definitely be the most entertaining,
I know it!

456
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,663
Cut him off, Riko!

457
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,334
Arman was working the entire time.

458
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,253
-I'm glad we found that out.
-Isn't it?

459
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,465
-They said he was the hardest worker.
-They did say that.

460
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,551
{\an8}Tetsu was useless.

461
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,053
{\an8}TETSUYA SUGAYA

462
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,887
-Arman was a diligent guy.
-Yeah.

463
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,223
-We're sorry, Arman.
-Yeah, we're sorry.

464
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,185
-We thought he was a slacker.
-He was working hard. We're sorry.

465
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,520
What about that bit
with Misaki and Byrnes?

466
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,689
-From now on...
-Oh, yes!

467
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,399
There was some innuendo.

468
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:31,197
"Living together,
I'm sure you were holding back..."

469
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,907
She didn't look down like that.

470
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,203
-Why do you do that?
-See!

471
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,415
-You're in trouble again.
-It's the way you say it.

472
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,875
Why do you have to say it like that?

473
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,213
-Why do you look at Ken's penis?
-Seriously.

474
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,049
{\an8}GAIENMAE, TOKYO

475
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:56,430
So if you don't mind setting up
for tomorrow's lunch.

476
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,641
-As usual?
-Yeah, the usual is fine.

477
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,935
-I prepped the salad already.
-Okay.

478
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,480
And the special dessert?

479
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,648
-The special dessert?
-Yeah.

480
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,150
I'll make it now.

481
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,694
Well, let's hope she comes.

482
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,489
Thank you for all your advice.

483
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,698
And for letting me use the restaurant.

484
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,784
That's not a problem at all.

485
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,078
Hope it goes well.
You're both young.

486
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,165
I'll head out now then.

487
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,793
-I'll finish up.
-Thank you.

488
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,529
Happy birthday, Martha!

489
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,740
Don't worry about it.

490
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,952
Don't worry about this guy.

491
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,039
Don't worry about him.

492
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,082
You guys are so lovey-dovey!

493
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,421
-Happy birthday!
-Yay!

494
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,505
Thank you!

495
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,714
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

496
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,385
Aren't they late?

497
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,263
I wonder what's happening?

498
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,474
Riko's probably on her way back
from Nagoya.

499
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,142
-Now?
-Today.

500
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,270
Did she tell him how she feels?

501
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,855
I don't know.
I don't even know if she'll go.

502
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,983
-Of course she'll go.
-She might come home alone.

503
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,068
I don't know.

504
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,739
Hayato was saying
he's making a fruit thing.

505
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,201
So it's one or the other.

506
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,621
Either they'll come back together,
or Riko will come back alone.

507
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,524
{\an8}SHINAGAWA, TOKYO
