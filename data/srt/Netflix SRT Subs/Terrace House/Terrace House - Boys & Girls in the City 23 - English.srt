1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,348
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,184
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,810
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,605
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,486
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,862
Last week...

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,322
-The meat crime.
-Yes, the meat crime.

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,783
The biggest crime in the history
of <i>Terrace House.</i>

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,786
It truly was a crime.

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,371
Watch out.

12
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,289
Looks amazing.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,999
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,501
Wow, is this for real?

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,336
It's not my favorite.

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,712
-This?
-Yeah, it's a little fatty.

17
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,214
Yeah, it's got a lot of fat.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,092
-You're mad?
-Yeah, I'm pretty upset.

19
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,887
That meat was from a client who came
all the way from Nagoya to visit Blast.

20
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,515
And they sent the meat from Nagoya.

21
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,601
There's value in the gift.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,478
I'm very sorry.

23
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,314
Whatever.

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>-He was pissed off.</i>
<i>-He was really pissed.</i>

25
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,405
He thought he had told Minori
how important it was to him.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,573
Right, beforehand.

27
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,617
The youngest guy,
tired after working construction,

28
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,619
went to apologize for eating the meat.

29
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,414
You'd think he'd say,
"No, it wasn't your fault."

30
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,040
Instead he said,
"I'm too upset to talk now."

31
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,875
Not yet.

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,878
I know it's just meat to you guys.

33
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,465
But it was something
that meant a lot to me.

34
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,802
Either way, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,721
I need to zone out for a bit.

36
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,639
I don't want to think about anything.

37
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,017
I'm really sorry.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,312
I know it's all I can say, but I'm sorry.

39
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:47,024
I can't calm down right now,
no matter what you say.

40
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,236
I'm looking at his name, Uchihara,
but all I see is Meat-hara.

41
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,494
A first in the history of relationships,
where a couple breaks up over meat.

42
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,913
-Break up caused by meat.
-Break up caused by meat.

43
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,625
He had told the guys the day before

44
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,044
that it was better
before they started going out.

45
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,880
Things don't seem great lately.

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,424
Yes, and then this happened.

47
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,260
When you have different priorities...

48
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,055
-You have different priorities?
-Yeah.

49
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,807
It would've been great
if we were just friends.

50
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,018
But if we're going to be
in a relationship...

51
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,729
then I think...

52
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:31,443
You quit your job
so that you can focus on modeling.

53
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,197
But I feel like you were more focused
when you were working.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,200
Is being with me
different than you imagined?

55
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,660
A first in the history of relationships.

56
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,246
I wonder if we'll get to see
a couple break up because of meat.

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,300
You were out.

58
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,595
-What happened?
-I drank...

59
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
-and went to a club.
-A club?

60
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,351
While you were drinking,
we were getting in trouble.

61
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,103
-What?
-I was getting in trouble.

62
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,355
-With whom?
-Uchi.

63
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,023
Uchi got mad at you?

64
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,402
-Oh, because of the meat.
-Yeah, how'd you know?

65
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,029
-That's hilarious.
-What? You ate some, too!

66
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,407
-He got mad about that?
-Yeah.

67
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,159
Seriously, he was pissed.

68
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,744
-For real?
-Yeah, pissed.

69
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,039
That's funny.

70
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,752
-Why are you wearing your jacket?
-Good morning.

71
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,712
Your eyes are bloodshot.

72
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,047
I was sleeping.

73
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,300
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

74
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,510
Work?

75
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,387
-Going to work?
-Yeah.

76
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,516
-Are you coming back late?
-Today? Yeah, I'll be late.

77
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,685
It's my last spurt.

78
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,520
The exhibition is in February?

79
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,314
-The exhibition got pushed back.
-It did?

80
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,191
Yeah, some things happened.

81
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,069
It'll be from March 15th to the 17th,
for three days.

82
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,907
But since your exhibition got pushed back,
does that mean you have more time?

83
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,243
-Or is that not it?
-It's because I didn't have enough time.

84
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,329
So it was extended
because you were too tight on time?

85
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,248
I see.

86
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,501
Well...

87
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,253
I'd better get going.

88
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,006
-Work hard!
-Thanks.

89
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,549
-Bye.
-Yeah.

90
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,217
-Take care.
-I'm off.

91
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,267
We watched the latest episode
of <i>Terrace House</i> together, right?

92
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,811
-Yeah.
-My sister was in it, right?

93
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,146
She's coming today.

94
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,355
-Where?
-Here.

95
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,107
What? Your sister?

96
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,150
What, now?

97
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,736
-My sister is coming over now.
-What?

98
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,654
Your sister is cute.

99
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,948
You should tell her that.

100
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,367
Don't be bothered by things she says.

101
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,787
-Am I in trouble?
-No, I don't know.

102
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,622
-I haven't done anything.
-That's true.

103
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,332
Maybe not someone she just meets.

104
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,167
Arman, my sister is coming over.

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,752
-Today? Seriously?
-Yeah.

106
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,756
This guy is so nonchalant.

107
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,135
KURUMI NAKADA, 24 YEARS OLD,
MODEL, MINORI'S OLDER SISTER

108
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,428
Hello.

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,641
-It's been a while.
-Long time no see.

110
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,060
Oh, new members.

111
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,313
Nice to meet you.

112
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,731
-Wow.
-Nice to meet you.

113
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,316
This is my older sister, Kurumi.

114
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,109
Hi, I'm Kurumi.

115
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,195
-I'm Natsumi.
-Natsumi?

116
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,239
-I'm Hikaru.
-Hikaru?

117
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,950
He's like the complete opposite of Tap.

118
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,288
-Arisa's not here?
-She's been busy with work lately.

119
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,998
And Uchi?

120
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,376
-Where is Uchi?
-Oh, he's just come back.

121
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,294
I think he's home already.

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,010
-I wasn't home.
-That's right.

123
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,303
We got in trouble.

124
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,097
-Got in trouble?
-With Uchi.

125
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,810
-Because of your lack of consideration?
-No, not like that.

126
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:57,023
There was some really nice meat
he got from a client from Nagoya.

127
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,900
We thought it was to share.

128
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:03,029
The night before last,
we thought we'd have it for dinner.

129
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,865
We didn't have any main dish besides rice.

130
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,534
But we had the meat,
so we decided to eat it.

131
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,661
-Uchi's meat?
-Uchi's meat.

132
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,247
So the three of us cooked and ate it.

133
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,749
Natsumi had already eaten dinner.

134
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,377
So yesterday, when I came home...

135
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,713
he was really quiet.

136
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,341
He asked, "How could you guys do that?"
He was pissed.

137
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,594
That's so petty.

138
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,475
-But the meat--
-Well, we hadn't asked him.

139
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,562
Yeah, we hadn't asked,
and we didn't tell him after.

140
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,190
Well, then you should've just hugged him
from behind and apologized.

141
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,485
-That's good. That would've solved it.
-Seriously, right?

142
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,696
-No, no. It wouldn't have.
-Why?

143
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,574
You can't?
That's the power of a girlfriend.

144
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,660
I don't think that would've been enough.

145
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,953
It would have.

146
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,123
-It would've put that matter to rest.
-Yeah.

147
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,083
Should we get Uchi?

148
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,836
-I see.
-Should I?

149
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,635
Uchi.

150
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,305
Uchi.

151
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,807
My sister is here.

152
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,144
-Did you know?
-Not today.

153
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,356
Are you still mad?

154
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,817
Not today.

155
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,277
I'm tired.

156
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,579
-How are things going, Arman?
-Good.

157
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,331
I'm just hanging around.
It's fun.

158
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,334
What about Arisa?
Are you two together?

159
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,127
No, we're not.
I was rejected.

160
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,629
What?

161
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,715
What? Why?

162
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,218
She said it was too soon.
We talked it out.

163
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,011
What? Really?

164
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,390
How could've it been too soon
at that point?

165
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,977
And since then, she's been really busy.

166
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,187
You should write "I'm lonely"
on omu-rice.

167
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,899
That's right.
I can't make omu-rice.

168
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,067
But that's a good idea.

169
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,655
How'd it go?

170
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,534
-He's not coming?
-What are you smiling for?

171
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,704
-No good.
-What do you mean?

172
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,747
-He won't get up.
-What?

173
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,165
What do you mean?

174
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,420
I asked if he's still mad,
but he only said, "I'm tired."

175
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,631
I told him you're here,
and he said,"Not today."

176
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,799
What?

177
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,093
-He should say hello.
-Yeah.

178
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,429
He's not even going to say hi?

179
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:38,768
If he's really this upset over the meat,
that seems pretty extreme.

180
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,854
Maybe I should go.

181
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,609
-You didn't eat the meat?
-No, I didn't.

182
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,029
-So he can't get mad at you.
-Right.

183
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,948
I'll go ask what he's thinking.

184
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,075
Nice.

185
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,245
Excuse me.

186
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,389
It's Nacchan.

187
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,101
Good morning.

188
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,729
Sorry to wake you.

189
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,856
-What's wrong?
-Well...

190
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,859
the two of us have never talked before.

191
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,694
-No, we haven't.
-No.

192
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,572
You seem a little depressed.

193
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,117
I'm not depressed.
But...

194
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,704
everything that I've been holding back
came out.

195
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,498
Because of the meat incident?

196
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,960
I just felt like, "That's it. who cares."
I don't wanna deal with anything anymore.

197
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,213
This is about Minori?

198
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,923
Everything.

199
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,554
So that's why you don't really care
that Minori's sister is here.

200
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,139
Yeah, it's like whatever.

201
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:05,230
Up until now,
did you and Minori often argue?

202
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,774
Lately, yeah.

203
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,984
We're so different.

204
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:15,657
The way we look at things...
is different.

205
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,203
It's just not what I want for myself.

206
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,917
It was great to be friends.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,545
But as partners...

208
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,966
we're not facing the same direction.

209
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,427
Like, Arisa's working really hard now.

210
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,597
I want her to work hard alongside me.

211
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,434
Yesterday, I came home from work,

212
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:48,439
and the meat I was saving was gone.

213
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,359
-I see.
-Of course I'd be upset.

214
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,444
It just confirmed my thoughts.

215
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:58,783
So, are you thinking of breaking up?

216
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,202
I don't know. I'm really confused.

217

223
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,710
Everyone was wondering
why you aren't joining us.

224
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,630
-You don't want to come up?
-Why?

225
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,758
Why can't I be alone?

226
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,011
Kurumi's here,
but you don't want to say hi?

227
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,888
It's all bothersome.

228
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,310
Then, I'll give you three options.

229
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,564
Kurumi will come here,
or you come upstairs,

230
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,651
or you stay here, sleep, and do nothing.

231
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,953
-Have Kurumi come here, then.
-Okay.

232
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,245
That's your choice?

233
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,500
I don't feel like talking with everyone.

234
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,587
-Good work.
-So...

235
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,964
Wait...

236
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,840
-Where's Uchi?
-Where's Uchi?

237
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,801
-He's not coming?
-No, he's not.

238
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,512
-What?
-But...

239
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,932
He did say a lot.

240
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,852
Everything he's done to live here...

241
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,440
He's worked really hard.

242
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,151
But the meat incident

243
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,154
just knocked loose
everything he's held back.

244
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,574
And now he just doesn't want to bother.

245
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:08,121
He doesn't want to put the effort
of hanging out with everyone.

246
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,665
It's fine that he's upset,
but he should say hi.

247
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,168
So, I gave him three options.

248
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,338
What's that?

249
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,758
To come talk with everyone upstairs,

250
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,387
or to have Kurumi go to Uchi...

251
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,682
or just sleep.

252
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,976
He chose option two.

253
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,437
Me? Really?

254
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,189
Why didn't he just tell me?

255
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:40,403
-I don't know! Ask Uchi.
-That's true.

256
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,904
That's a little...

257
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,365
Why does he talk to Minori the least?

258
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,118
He says it's a bother.

259
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,120
-That's the end then.
-We're done then.

260
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,747
What else?

261
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,583
-He talked about Minori...
-What else?

262
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,129
But I don't think it'll sound right
coming from me.

263
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,631
-Do you want to know?
-Yeah.

264
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,467
I do.

265
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,763
He said that Arisa's working hard
right now,

266
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,892
and seeing that inspires him to work hard.

267
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,977
It's fine if you're just friends,

268
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,980
but as partners...

269
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,608
He wants you guys to motivate each other.

270
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,698
You can say, "Then we don't match,"
and just end things

271
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,326
if you're fine with that.

272
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,037
Or is it something you can work out,
find a solution,

273
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,331
and take your relationship
to the next level?

274
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,665
It's up to you.

275
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,092
So it's not about the meat,

276
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,136
-but about things before?
-Yeah, it's an accumulation.

277
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,431
The meat just pushed it over the edge.

278
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,476
So, Minori...

279
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,978
maybe it's different
because I'm your sister,

280
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,980
but aren't there moments

281
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,235
when you, as friends, want Minori
to really convey her thoughts?

282
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,654
Yes, definitely.

283
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,323
-Now's that time.
-I believe now is that time.

284
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,618
Is it okay?

285
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,329
-I'm off then.
-Good luck.

286
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,456
Good luck.

287
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll be back.

288
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,052
Mr. Uchihara.

289
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,680
Good evening.

290
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,683
Sorry, I made you come down.

291
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,767
Well...

292
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,062
So, I heard about the meat.

293
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,024
I must have been pretty stressed.

294
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,026
I was very stressed.

295
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,029
So I'm sure for them it was more like,

296
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,533
"Yay, meat for everyone!
Thanks, Uchi."

297
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,704
But that was a little different
from what you thought.

298
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,834
I think that's all it was.

299
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,336
I didn't say it was for everyone.

300
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,298
But from everyone's viewpoint,
if you came back with meat,

301
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,925
-it was like, "Oh, he brought meat--"
-I said...

302
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,553
I said, "Look at what my client gave me."

303
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,098
That's all I said.

304
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,058
I didn't say they could eat it.

305
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,520
-What did you want exactly?
-It's just...

306
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,732
It was taken so lightly.

307
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,234
And the attitude.

308
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:31,115
Let's say it was just a misunderstanding,
and then they found out how I really felt.

309
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,036
But it didn't feel like they were sincere.

310
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,163
-You didn't?
-No.

311
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,540
According to Hikaru,

312
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:44,212
he didn't understand what the problem was
with eating the meat at first.

313
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,630
But after hearing your explanation,

314
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:51,135
he said he felt really bad
and sincerely apologized.

315
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,639
I don't want to compromise anymore.

316
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,265
With anyone?

317
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,268
It's all such a bother now.

318
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,231
What you said now is exactly
what Minori usually does.

319
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,066
Why should I have to bend?

320
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,487
When others don't try to understand me,
why should I bother?

321
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,741
It took a lot of courage for Minori
to come see you.

322
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,619
Okay, she had the courage to see me.

323
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,374
But her words...

324
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,960
I couldn't feel her sincerity.

325
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,795
Well...

326
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:32,385
she doesn't want to just leave things
the way they are.

327
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,638
I think that's why Minori came here.

328
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:42,395
-It was too much of a shock for me.
-It was too much?

329
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,899
I was so upset...
I couldn't hold it in.

330
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,945
If you don't hold back,
you won't be able to explain.

331
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,947
I did explain, but...

332
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm so fed up.

333
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,661
I don't even want to bother explaining.

334
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,331
Minori can be like that, too.
She doesn't want to bother explaining.

335
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,793
There's a lot that will bother her
during an argument,

336
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:10,464
but she'll just say, "I understand,"
because she doesn't want to bother.

337
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,050
You don't like it
when she does that, right?

338
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,595
Of course.

339
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,347
You're doing exactly the same thing.

340
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,310
I know it's just meat to the others.

341
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,980
But someone's thoughts are there.

342
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,609
My feelings were a part of it as well.

343
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,778
How that was dealt with was a shock.

344
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,240
I can't just say, "Okay..."

345
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,076
so soon.

346
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,538
Minori would rather talk to you in person.

347
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,750
The fact you're not telling her directly
is just her frustrations right now.

348
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,835
What normally bothers you

349
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,255
and what normally bothers her
should come out.

350
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,051
Right now, I think she'd be able to say
what she normally holds back,

351
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,012
and in fact, she did a little upstairs.

352
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:03,100
I think now is the time to tell each other
how each of you really feels.

353
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,104
I think that can lead to

354
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,691
the kind of motivating relationship
you're looking for.

355
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,652
Am I wrong?

356
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,446
Right.

357
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,616
I feel much calmer now.

358
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,618
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

359
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,954
I will.

360
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:30,503
The meat was more significant
than we had ever imagined.

361
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,631
-He's still mad.
-Yes, still.

362
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,968
Things with Minori just added up.

363
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,013
Kurumi got things moving.

364
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,683
-She's really amazing.
-Yeah, amazing.

365
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,103
I was impressed that she listened
so attentively to the meat story.

366
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,898
-She's such an adult.
-She's impressive, this sister.

367
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,859
Natsumi was amazing, too.

368
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,403
Explaining it all.

369
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,657
I think it's okay in this case.

370
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,243
-Really?
-Yeah, because it's all true.

371
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,996
But still, when she said,
"He talked about Minori.

372
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,792
But...
it won't sound right coming from me."

373
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,627
Of course she's gonna say it.

374
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,048
In that case, it's the same as saying,
"Please don't twist my arm."

375
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,343
When she came back and said,

376
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:23,639
"He told me a lot about you,"
she shouldn't have said it that way.

377
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,015
That's true.

378
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,518
-I wonder what will happen.
-Will he come to the living room?

379
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,354
Maybe Minori will go downstairs?

380
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,150
Is everyone just going
to take turns apologizing?

381
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,610
-One at a time?
-Yeah, one at a time.

382
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,740
-She's back.
-Welcome back.

383
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,324
Welcome back.

384
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,995
He said he'll talk to you.

385
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,288
-When?
-Now.

386
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,622
-Now?
-What?

387
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,624
And just so you know,

388
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,755
Uchi says he doesn't wanna talk to anyone
because it's a bother,

389
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,340
and that is exactly
what Minori would normally do.

390
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,551
Like, you don't want to bother explaining.

391
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:06,640
That's why you should tell each other
what each of you is bothered by.

392
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,100
We should talk it out?

393
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,604
This is probably the best time to say it.

394
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,107
Thank you very much.

395
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,317
You too, Nacchan.

396
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,194
I haven't done anything.

397
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,862
Go, me!

398
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,157
Good luck.

399
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,049
Wake up.

400
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,187
Hold on a sec.

401
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,862
What's wrong?

402
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,391
Are you okay?

403
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,524
I'm okay.

404
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,867
Why are you crying?

405
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,412
Everything I've held back until now
broke loose.

406
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,747
Until now?

407
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,584
From this shared living situation.

408
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,712
It's been tough for you?

409
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,630
I'm tired of it.

410
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,841
I think.

411
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,429
I heard what you talked about
with my sister and Nacchan.

412
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,559
I heard, but never directly from you.

413
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,395
That upsets me.

414
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,607
You should always...

415
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,612
tell me what you really feel,
like you are now.

416
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,283
I know that you're really tired.

417
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,368
You usually just go to sleep
when you get home.

418
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,581
So even when you're home,
I feel like...

419
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,542
we don't really talk.

420
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,920
I can't tell if you're even interested.

421
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:47,468
Sometimes I make dinner
before you get back.

422
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,763
Before, you said...

423
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,975
if I cooked, then you would too.

424
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:59,772
That hasn't happened lately.

425
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,816
I feel like maybe you don't care anymore.

426
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,735
It made me feel that way.

427
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,864
I cleaned the Japanese-style room,
vacuumed, aired the futon and more...

428
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,743
but I don't think you even noticed.

429
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,330
I'm sorry.

430
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,626
I don't work every day, so to you,

431
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,881
I know it doesn't seem like
I'm working very hard.

432
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:32,930
So coming home tired
and just falling asleep

433
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,350
has become the norm for you.

434
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,354
You hang out with everyone downstairs.

435
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,857
You play cards with them and stuff.

436
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:48,612
I'm sorry, but I want to sleep.

437
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,114
What do you mean?

438
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,533
About talking...

439
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:58,497
It's rare that you initiate conversations.

440
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:04,503
I was afraid you'd just say you have work.

441
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,091
I'm sorry for that.

442
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,261
I don't like...

443
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,596
how you're too passive at times.

444
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,016
What's happening now...

445
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,230
is mostly because I'm just tired.

446
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:27,901
You, your sister and Nacchan
have all come to talk to me,

447
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,487
and I feel really grateful.

448
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,451
I'm okay.

449
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,914
-Don't cry.
-I'm okay.

450
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,839
Let's make up.

451
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,049
Your hands are sweaty.

452
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

453
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,476
I'm okay.

454
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,896
-Are you crying?
-I'm not.

455
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,857
I'm not.

456
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,819
It's my first time seeing you like this.

457
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,949
ZUSHI, KANAGAWA

458
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:23,874
You can pull all these down-facing leaves.

459
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:29,087
Start from the bottom,
and take them off in turn.

460
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,255
HISATO KOJIMA, OWNER

461
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,007
-This is the bottom, right?
-Yes.

462
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,884
If you pull it, it'll come off.

463
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:40,349
-All the ones facing down?
-Yes, pull all of them out.

464
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,323
-It feels good to pull them out.
-What?

465
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,450
-Feels good, right?
-Yes, it's cathartic.

466
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,412
-That looks good.
-Got it.

467
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,469
-Don't leave any behind.
-Understood.

468
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,682
So, Arman,
people in Hawaii don't really work.

469
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:26,436
-That's true.
-When I was in Hawaii...

470
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,899
I looked at the stones
lining the streets of Waikiki.

471
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,194
I even watched
the gardeners in the hotels.

472
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,864
-But they go home around 3:00 p.m.
-They do.

473
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,032
-They're often called slackers.
-Really?

474
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,911
But really...

475
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:47,124
no one works as hard as you.

476
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,836
-You do good work for us.
-Thank you.

477
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,338
How's <i>Terrace House</i> going?
Having fun?

478
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,840
-Yes, it's fun right now.
-Is it?

479
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,050
-You said something happened?
-Yes.

480
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,302
What happened with that?

481
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,597
She's been really busy with work lately.

482
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,099
We haven't really had time to talk.

483
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,518
I'm thinking, eventually...

484
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,396
I can take her to lunch or something.

485
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:15,068
But before that, you dated Mizuki, too.

486
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:19,573
It's hard to fall in love
if you keep dating around.

487
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,076
-That's true.
-Maybe you shouldn't date so many girls.

488
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,165
-That's true.
-It's fun to date different girls.

489
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,625
That's for sure.

490
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,085
But it's more fun to love one girl.

491
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,549
Especially since you look like a player.

492
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,680
I have a feeling it's not gonna happen.

493
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,479
-You're not going to sleep?
-I will.

494
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,565
-After I relax.
-What do you mean?

495
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,692
I'm going to relax here and then sleep.

496
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,531
-Good night.
-Good night.

497
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,783
Oh, there's tea.

498
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,117
Hey.

499
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,121
-Good night.
-Good night.

500
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,539
You're not going to bed?

501
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,500
Don't you think Minori's demeanor changed?

502
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,043
Has she?

503
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,254
After the meat incident?

504
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,923
She's happy because they made up.

505
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,218
She's exuding happiness.

506
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,511
By the way...

507
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,847
has anything happened with Arman?

508
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,141
-What? No, nothing.
-You haven't gone out after?

509
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,851
-No.
-Oh, you haven't.

510
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,063
If it's just two people,
does it mean it's a date?

511
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,439
It turns into a date?

512
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,193
If you know
you're just hanging out as friends,

513
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,820
then it's just an outing.

514
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,074
The possibility isn't zero percent, right?

515
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,245
Isn't it zero percent for me?
It's zero, right?

516
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,872
You mean you and I?

517
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,457
You're asking
if it's zero percent on my part?

518
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,251
You're asking me that?

519
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,460
-Why?
-I'm just surprised.

520
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,796
-I can't ask?
-Well...

521
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,092
it's not zero.

522
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,510
It's not zero?

523
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,265
-You thought it'd be zero?
-Yeah.

524
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,519
So it's zero on your part then?

525
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,192
-Two?
-Two percent?

526
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,528
What? For real?

527
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,363
Because I thought it was zero for you.

528
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,948
On my part you mean?

529
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:29,328
Your personality is totally my type.

530
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,955
-My personality?
-Yeah.

531
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,000
You're very much a guy's guy.

532
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,752
-You are.
-I don't know.

533
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,462
-You are.
-I think I'm normal.

534
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:44,009
So, I was hoping
there'd be someone like that.

535
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,179
-Why do you laugh?
-I'm just embarrassed.

536
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,223
-Oh, I see.
-Yeah.

537
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,933
But it's two percent.

538
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,061
Then...

539
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,563
seventy percent.

540
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:00,776
I'm 18 though.
You're not concerned about age?

541
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,277
That's exactly it.

542
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,364
-You are concerned?
-Yes, of course.

543
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,826
-Wanna go somewhere?
-Where?

544
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,454
Maybe dinner sometime?
When you're off.

545
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,624
Then tomorrow.

546
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,000
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

547
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,045
I'll cancel everything
and take the day off.

548
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,844
When I have construction work,
I'm done at 5:00 p.m.

549
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,181
We can see what day works,
and we can do dinner?

550
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,516
Sure.

551
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,018
It was a crisis.

552
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,772
-He was a little broken.
-It was a meat cry.

553
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,691
So everything, life at <i>Terrace House,</i>

554
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,320
issues with Minori
and maybe some things from work.

555
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,783
Everything has built up...

556
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,034
and exploded.

557
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,745
-So it seemed.
-Yes.

558
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,580
If that's the case, it's understandable.

559
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,499
-On the other hand...
-What?

560
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,128
If it was really just about the meat...

561
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,005
For the first time, we're going
to have to close the door on them.

562
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,008
You mean the door right here?

563
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,885
-Yes, from this side.
-Seriously?

564
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,555
But I may be curious and want a peek.

565
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,308
"Let's make up."

566
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,894
-That's right.
-What was that?

567
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:23,942
There was a power imbalance
in which Uchi kept berating Minori.

568
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,195
But by crying in front of Minori,

569
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,491
they became equals,
or maybe power tilted to Minori.

570
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,827
So she comforts him.

571
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,914
The power balance may have shifted
into a good place.

572
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,668
And toward the end, what was that?

573
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,837
-What was that?
-Natsumi and Hikaru...

574
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,214
It was like a scene from a bar.

575
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,592
Things like that happen every night.

576
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,303
That's true.

577
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,973
"Do you go out to dinner pretty often?

578
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,433
After work?"

579
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,186
"Well... tomorrow...

580
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,520
do you have work?"

581
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,190
-"No?"
-"No, not really."

582
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:06,318
-"Just gonna chill?"
-"Yeah, just taking it easy."

583
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,362
"You?"

584
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,364
"Tomorrow? I work at night so..."

585
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,991
"Oh, I see..."

586
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:23,752
When you guys do re-enactments,
it's totally from personal experience.

587
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,921
-It's too real.
-Yeah.

588
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,422
Those pauses...

589
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,424
A lot is said in those pauses.

590
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,178
<i>-Do you want me to take it?</i>
<i>-Let's take one together.</i>

591
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,555
<i>Wow, it's really pretty.</i>

592
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,353
-So lovey-dovey.
-Wow!

593
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,729
Is it bad?

594
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,273
What's with the arm move?

595
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,694
You guys are so close!

596
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,696
No, it's just normal distance.

597
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,116
Things look like they're going well here.

598
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,662
<i>I really like you right now.</i>

599
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>Will you be my girlfriend?</i>

600
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,926
<i>It's like...</i>
<i>Family? Brother? Like friends...</i>

601
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,721
<i>The more we hung out,</i>

602
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:20,058
<i>the more my feelings tilted that way,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

603
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,311
<i>-Shall we go?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

604
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,527
It's sad.
So you were rejected?

605
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,863
No, I don't know...
It's vague.

606
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,329
It ended.

607
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,835
Oh, man...

608
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,044
Good night.

609
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,672
-Good night.
-Good night.

610
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,049
You approached her because you liked her.

611
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,719
And she said she liked you, too.

612
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:00,932
That she liked you
and wanted to go places with you.

613
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,269
But she hasn't said anything since, right?

614
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
-You haven't talked since then, right?
-No.

615
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,898
It still felt vague though.

616
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,610
It didn't end clearly.
Are you okay with that?

617
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,867
Arisa.

618
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,162
Are you awake?

619
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,039
-I just woke up.
-You did.

620
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,082
Can you get up?

621
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,252
You getting up early tomorrow morning?

622
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,962
About 10:00 a.m.

623
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,089
Can we talk?

624
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,557
We just watched
the latest episode on Netflix.

625
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,268
Where Arman told you how he felt.

626
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,562
I've only heard about it.

627
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,905
-Are you okay?
-That scared me.

628
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,531
That scared me.

629
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,243
-Can I come in?
-Come in.

630
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,835
I wanted to talk to you.

631
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,713
You were awake?
I thought you'd be asleep.

632
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:18,426
-Did she leave?
-Minori left. She's gone.

633
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,261
I'm tired...

634
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,638
and falling over.

635
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,685
Well...

636
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,480
I still have feelings for you.

637
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:36,444
You said before you still wanted to date
and continue our relationship.

638
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,613
But we haven't seen each other
at all this year,

639
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,782
and nothing's changed.

640
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,912
I know you're busy.

641
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,375
But if you feel something for me at all,

642
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:55,171
you could spare even ten minutes a day
to talk to me.

643
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,339
That's what I think.

644
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:00,385
So I wanted to ask one last time
how you feel about me.

645
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:07,142
I don't think I can think about you.

646
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,730
I have my hands full
with myself right now.

647
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,819
I'm not really in the mood
for a relationship.

648
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,863
I guess...

649
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,286
I don't have time to think about
anything else right now.

650
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,543
I'm sorry.

651
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,508
I'm glad you cleared that up this time.

652
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,928
Good luck with your work.

653
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,222
But let's continue...

654
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,518
to be good housemates.

655
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,317
Good night.
