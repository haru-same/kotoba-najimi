1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,809
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,435
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,063
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,774
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,902
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,111
Last week--

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,322
-There's a lot going on right now.
-There is.

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,282
-A heart-fluttering turn of events.
-Yes.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,201
-The bike date was so nice.
-So nice.

11
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,036
<i>-Hikaru and Misaki...</i>
<i>-Their bike date.</i>

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,370
HIKARU OTA
MISAKI TAMORI

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>It was sexy.</i>

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,750
-Are you into motorcycles now?
-I'm into them.

15
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,919
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

16
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,045
For real.

17
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,464
-I laugh more when I'm with you.
-Really?

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,424
-Yeah.
-No way.

19
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,761
-And she made him hamburgers.
-She did.

20
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,556
-She even cried.
-Yes, those tears!

21
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,683
It was so cute.

22
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,185
-This is making me want to cry.
-I'm seriously moved.

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,478
-Why?
-I don't know.

24
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,188
Why?

25
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,356
What's wrong?

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,275
-What? Why?
-I'm sorry, it's not hard.

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,777
-No, it's not that.
-It's not hard at all.

28
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,029
It's seriously good. Really good.

29
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,990
-You're just relieved.
-Yeah.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,158
Thank you.

31
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,704
-The two of them are so pure.
-Yes.

32
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,873
-It's going well for them.
-Yes.

33
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,459
-And Natsumi...
-She made a move on Hansan.

34
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,670
She invited him fishing.

35
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,380
That's right, that's right.

36
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,882
I like ocean fishing.

37
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,216
-In a boat?
-Yeah, a boat.

38
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,676
-But from the shore is okay, too.
-Nice.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,761
Let's go.

40
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,096
With the exams,
you're probably not in the mindset.

41
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,723
Yeah, there's a lot going on.

42
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,808
It'll be a reward for all your hard work.

43
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,476
Yeah, let's do that.

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,524
"After all your hard work...
I'll go out with you as a reward."

45
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,068
She made a statement
that speaks highly of herself.

46
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,070
She meant going fishing would be a reward.

47
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,616
So it's not the fact
he gets to fish with her?

48
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,825
I don't think so.

49
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,286
She'd be a terrible person otherwise.

50
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,873
Oh, and Arisa...

51
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,251
When the exhibit is over...

52
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,504
I'm thinking of leaving <i>Terrace House.</i>

53
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,173
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

54
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,383
I wonder if she's leaving this week.

55
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,885
I wonder.

56
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,055
If you were asked
to draw a clear object...

57
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,559
what would you draw?

58
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,644
I'd leave it empty.

59
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,855
No, you have to draw something clear.

60
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,067
-It's so hard.
-How about a glass?

61
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,570
No, not that kind of clear.

62
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,072
-Something more abstract.
-I know.

63
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,700
What about your music?

64
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,117
-My music?
-Sound.

65
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:44,122
Draw something that expresses sound
without drawing notes nor instruments.

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,333
But draw sound.

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,544
That, I can draw.

68
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,796
I don't get it.

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,506
The music inside me.

70
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,383
I thought of something!

71
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,677
See ya.

72
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,431
-Where are you going?
-I've got to work on my thesis.

73
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,517
I have to read.

74
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,435
I'll bring my drawing when I'm done.

75
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,233
Don't look.

76
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,902
It's nice.
It reminds me of elementary school.

77
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,280
-Is that a compliment?
-Yes.

78
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,745
-Hey, Hikaru?
-Yeah?

79
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,998
-Will you take me out?
-What?

80
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,541
Take me out somewhere.

81
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,960
Take you out?

82
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,921
I've been wondering
when you'd ask me out again.

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,134
You haven't said anything.

84
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,636
Yeah...

85
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,890
-On your bike.
-You want to go on my bike again?

86
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,808
Yeah, it was really fun.

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,561
Yeah, but...

88
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,397
You don't want to?

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,733
No, it's not that.

90
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,032
You don't seem like you want to.

91
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,202
-Did you have fun before?
-Yeah, well, I like bikes.

92
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,455
That's not what you're asking.

93
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,292
-No, it's not.
-It was fun.

94
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,502
-Really?
-It was.

95
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,587
-It doesn't seem like--
-I told you I had fun, too.

96
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,507
I can't tell with you.
You're a mystery to me.

97
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,884
-What do you mean?
-You're a mystery.

98
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,512
I can't tell what you're thinking at all.

99
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,309
It's hard to know who you are.

100
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,980
That means
you're thinking about me too much.

101
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,983
I am?

102
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,902
It's why you're reading into it too much.

103
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,904
But you're obviously thinking something.

104
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,406
I don't know what it is, but...

105
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,703
Let's decide now then.

106
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,621
Where do you want to go?

107
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,207
-Anywhere specific?
-The hot springs.

108
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,334
Sure, we can go to the hot springs.

109
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,336
Okay, it's decided then.

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,301
It's decided.

111
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,309
DAIKAN-YAMA, TOKYO

112
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,110
I wanted the girls to work on the details,

113
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,321
like putting on the stickers
and wrapping the catalogues.

114
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,700
-If you don't mind taking care of that?
-No problem.

115
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,429
Are you on schedule, Arisa?

116
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,600
-I'm catching up more every day.
-Really?

117
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:55,564
Since everyone is helping me,
I feel like I need to work harder.

118
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,608
If I were on my own...

119
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,735
-You wouldn't have?
-I would've slacked in some areas.

120
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,445
-Like, "Well, that's good enough."
-I see.

121
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,825
Tired?

122
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,662
A little.

123
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,789
-It was pretty heavy.
-Yeah.

124
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,331
My arms are sore.

125
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,918
-I hope it goes well.
-Yeah.

126
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,547
As long as Arisa says she's glad,
it went well in the end.

127
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,757
Yeah, that'd be nice to hear.

128
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,843
Have you talked to Nacchan lately?

129
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,261
-To Nacchan?
-Yeah.

130
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,014
Yeah, normal conversations. Why?

131
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,142
-You heard about the fishing?
-Oh, yeah.

132
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,270
She said she's going fishing with you.

133
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,523
I asked her if it's just the two of you,
and she said yeah.

134
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,902
I don't think I can go fishing with her.

135
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,405
-The two of you? Oh, you don't want to.
-Yeah, I don't want to.

136
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:51,537
I gave my girlfriend
a gift the other day,

137
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,915
a fishing rod and reel,

138
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,585
and I told her we should go fishing.

139
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,588
But I live here,
so I haven't been able to take her.

140
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,174
So if I go fishing now, it would look bad.

141
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,385
-It would be the worst.
-I think I should cancel the fishing trip.

142
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,516
I feel that, knowing Nacchan,
I think it's better to make things clear

143
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,186
rather than just pretend
it didn't happen.

144
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,481
Has your girlfriend said anything?

145
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,233
She said she misses me.

146
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,985
-That's it?
-Yeah.

147
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,238
She hasn't tried to stop you?
Like, "I can't take it"?

148
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,032
She might be thinking it,
but she'd never say it.

149
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,620
At my place the other day...

150
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,122
I mean the studio...

151
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,501
When I was working on
the mock-up for Arisa,

152
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,253
or rather, the model for her...

153
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,421
my girlfriend came over,
so I asked her to help.

154
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:46,008
She said,
"No, I refuse to help with that."

155
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,343
-'Cause it's for Arisa?
-Yeah.

156
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,469
Crazy.

157
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,097
-Yeah.
-So she was jealous.

158
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,516
You guys are lovey-dovey then?

159
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,603
I'm not really sure.

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,527
There are three women in closer vicinity
than my girlfriend right now.

161
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,403
It's hard to ignore.

162
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,867
The moment I find myself
attracted to any of them...

163
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,161
in my mind, that's cheating.

164
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,706
If that happened,
I'd probably break it off.

165
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,625
-If it were you, you wouldn't tell her?
-Who?

166
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,044
-To your girlfriend, I mean.
-I wouldn't.

167
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,213
Not at that point anyway.

168
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,722
Yes?

169
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,060
-Can I come in?
-Sure!

170
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,854
-Are you by yourself?
-Yes.

171
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,773
-Oh, good.
-Good?

172
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,108
-I wanted to talk to you.
-What is it?

173
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,112
-Can I sit here?
-Yes.

174
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,407
-What we talked about the other day...
-What we talked about?

175
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,743
-About going fishing?
-Oh, yes.

176
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,537
-Well...
-Yes?

177
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,834
I can't go fishing with you
if it's just the two of us.

178
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,588
-I can't.
-Okay.

179
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,590
I had promised my girlfriend...

180
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,424
-What do you mean?
-That I'd go fishing with her.

181
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,760
I had promised her,
but hadn't taken her yet.

182
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,637
Oh, I see.

183
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:17,349
So I don't think
I should go fishing with you.

184
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,642
-Yeah.
-Okay.

185
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:23,438
But like you said,
I would like to talk with you more.

186
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,857
Okay.

187
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,277
-Since we haven't talked much.
-Yeah.

188
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,655
So...
What's wrong?

189
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,990
Oh...

190
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,954
It's nothing.

191
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,372
And?

192
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,002
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. Don't take it the wrong way.

193
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,839
I'm sorry.
I had other things on my mind.

194
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,843
I thought maybe
you'd like to go out to eat sometime?

195
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,679
-I came to ask you out.
-Thank you.

196
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,848
You did? Thank you.

197
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,060
I'm almost done with my work right now.

198
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,229
So, afterwards.

199
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,732
Okay.

200
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,402
Are you okay?
Something's bothering you.

201
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,863
Yeah, I am.

202
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,658
Store it for now.

203
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,369
-I don't know if I can anymore.
-I'll...

204
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,790
I'll lend you my ear.

205
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,420
I don't know if I can help, but...

206
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,927
Why are you crying?

207
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,596
-Why are you crying now?
-I don't know.

208
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,766
-What is it?
-I don't know.

209
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,519
I don't understand
what I've been feeling lately.

210
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,731
Let's go now.

211
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,357
Let's get a drink.

212
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,443
-Right now?
-Yeah, let's go now.

213
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,611
Okay.

214
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,906
-That makes me so happy.
-Let's go.

215
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,367
It's an emergency.

216
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,705
Now I feel like drinking.
Let's go.

217
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,086
Thank you.

TEPPAN BUAISOU

226
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,684
What's going on?
Seriously.

227
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,354
When I came to <i>Terrace House...</i>

228
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:15,736
in the beginning, I'd speak my mind

229
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,781
without really taking others
into consideration.

230
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:24,995
I used to do that
without really worrying about others.

231
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,750
But after everything
that happened with Minori

232
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:36,131
and after I realized
how different other people are from me,

233
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:41,386
I couldn't really speak my mind anymore.

234
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,183
It's been really tough for me lately.

235
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,686
I see.

236
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,522
So when you said
you couldn't go fishing...

237
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,233
it felt like, "Now you, too?"

238
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,238
Not to say you were my last hope.

239
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:06,787
But at least with you,
I wanted things to be honest.

240
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,582
So when you said you couldn't...

241
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,960
I felt a little overwhelmed.

242
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,338
And it all came pouring out.

243
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,635
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

244
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,053
But...

245
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,932
What do you want to say?

246
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,351
You said you can't really speak
your mind anymore.

247
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,521
What sort of things are on your mind?

248
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,191
I've never been really good
at smiling for the sake of politeness.

249
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:43,448
I wouldn't normally join conversations
I have no interest in, personality wise.

250
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:47,244
But with shared living,
if I'm with everyone,

251
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,081
even if I'm not interested
in the conversation...

252
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,083
-Yeah, I get it.
-Yeah.

253
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,671
It's hard to just even laugh.

254
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:04,011
I'm not usually interested
in other people's relationship issues.

255
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,765
Really? I wouldn't have guessed.

256
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,433
I thought you enjoyed that kind of thing.

257
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,935
-Really?
-Yeah.

258
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:18,942
It seemed like you were trying really hard
to get Misaki and Hikaru together.

259
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,529
Yeah, that kind of thing.

260
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,782
-I've never done anything like it before.
-Really?

261
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,701
-That's unexpected.
-Yeah.

262
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:33,040
I think you should be more confident.

263
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,333
With what?

264
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,085
-With myself?
-Yeah.

265
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,255
In how you think.

266
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,467
How, if something is wrong,
you think people should say it's wrong.

267
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,845
It's great.

268
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,724
It's really an amazing thing.

269
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:53,602
Everyone's scared
of what others think of them.

270
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:58,941
I'd like to be able
to clearly speak my mind more, too.

271
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,359
Like you.

272
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,446
I think you can be more confident.

273
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,365
You should speak up.

274
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,995
You've cleared things up for me.

275
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,789
-Really?
-Yeah.

276
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,165
I'm glad.

277
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,876
We can grab a drink anytime.

278
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,258
Thank you.

279
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,427
What?

280
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,722
Hold on.

281
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,766
-Tokui...
-Hold on.

282
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,561
First of all, Hikaru...

283
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,730
Oh, right, that happened first.

284
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,315
I thought they'd be lovey-dovey, but...

285
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:45,362
If someone said that to me,
I'd think he wasn't interested anymore.

286
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,824
I mean, she asked if he had fun,
and he said,

287
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,118
"Well, I like bikes."

288
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,205
He purposefully said it was fun
because of the bike, not her.

289
00:15:55,288 --> 00:16:00,377
-He's doing it on purpose, right?
-Yes, I sense an ulterior motive.

290
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,757
Maybe the date wasn't what he expected?

291
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,217
Like he's not totally sure yet, but...

292
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,637
But she touched him and everything.

293
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,099
I'm talking with Kentaro now.

294
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,561
And she didn't touch him.
She didn't mean to anyway.

295
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:19,688
That's not what we're talking about now.

296
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,274
Shut down.

297
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,613
Either he felt like she wasn't the one,
or his feelings have cooled off.

298
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,283
Maybe he doesn't like
that she's coming on so strong.

299
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,076
He could be that type.

300
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,248
I can see how Hikaru may be turned off
by her coming on too strong.

301
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,834
-So ungrateful.
-Do you feel the same way, Tokui?

302
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,004
I think most guys feel that way
to some degree.

303
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,213
Someone doesn't.

304
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:50,719
He's probably never had a woman
strongly come on to him.

305
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,473
It hasn't been triggered yet,
but he does have that switch.

306
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:56,600
I guess you have it, too.

307
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,894
-I have that switch?
-You do.

308
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,772
A switch where a woman is coming on to me,
but I won't like it?

309
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,982
I don't want to push a switch like that.

310
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,611
No one's asking you to.

311
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,363
You're losing interest.

312
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,033
Scary.

313
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,204
-But it's what happened after.
-Yes, after.

314
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,915
You all finally see
some discrepancy, right?

315
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,545
The exchange between
Hikaru and Tamosan was rather young.

316
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,047
We suddenly switch
to one that's more grown up.

317
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,674
-Completely more mature.
-Yes.

318
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,677
-From young fawns to seasoned deer.
-It did.

319
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,596
It certainly did!

320
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,974
-We suddenly became worried.
-Yes.

321
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,601
-From the girls' room.
-Yes.

322
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:42,270
Nacchan initially invited him
to go fishing.

323
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:47,150
But after thinking it over,
he decided not to go

324
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,487
since he had previously promised
to take his girlfriend fishing.

325
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:54,116
Not that he doesn't like Nacchan,
but just out of principle.

326
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,910
He should first take his girlfriend.

327
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,413
He went to the girls' room to explain.

328
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:06,712
He told her rather honestly
why he can't go fishing with her.

329
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:12,134
Handa did what he needed to do
and said what he needed to say.

330
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,262
And Nacchan cried
and he wondered if she's okay.

331
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,599
Handa, in his maturity,
realized something must be bothering her.

332
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,809
It's not because of the fishing.

333
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,228
-Yes, he understood that.
-Yes.

334
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,816
She revealed what's been bothering her.
He told her she should be who she is.

335
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,237
He reaffirmed her values
and she felt better. Right?

336
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,490
This is how affairs begin.

337
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,745
This is the process
from which affairs begin.

338
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,371
I see.

339
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,331
It's totally viable.

340
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,958
This is cheating!

341
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,420
Right.

342
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:52,424
It's the worst kind, actually.

343
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,427
-I totally get you.
-Because neither of them intends to cheat.

344
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,639
And then suddenly,
"Wait, I'm cheating now?"

345
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:06,188
Because after that kind of conversation,
both sides feel it's safe being friends.

346
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,108
And as they go to each other
to talk out issues,

347
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,362
feelings for each other
begin to accumulate.

348
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,490
Then one night, when they're both drunk...

349
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,202
Thank you.

350
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,788
I didn't realize.
I want them to stop.

351
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,001
-You never know. It's Hansan.
-I don't want them to see each other!

352
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,462
That's impossible.
They live together.

353
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:33,381
-And he said...
-No!

354
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,300
-"Let's go right now."
-Yes, yes.

355
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,012
That was already the first step
to having an affair.

356
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,389
-That was?
-It was a big move then.

357
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,684
If he had waited,
the situation wouldn't be as dire.

358
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,393
This is if we're discussing cheating.

359
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,187
-If it's cheating.
-Only if it's cheating.

360
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,816
Then he's very skilled, isn't he?

361
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,820
Hansan had dinner with Nacchan yesterday.

362
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,032
-What?
-You had dinner with Nacchan yesterday.

363
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,200
Yeah.

364
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:04,287
-How come?
-She said she was losing sight of herself.

365
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,166
She's having trouble
with some aspects of shared living.

366
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,129
-She was bothered.
-But she said she had fun.

367
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,006
It worked out.

368
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:19,094
-Problem solved?
-She said it was solved.

369
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:23,807
-I wonder why she told Hansan.
-It just happened that way.

370
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,477
But you'd think she'd talk to me.

371
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,149
Don't you think?
Shouldn't she talk to me?

372
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,278
I don't know.
Maybe she couldn't because we're close.

373
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,114
But I would've rather
she told me about it.

374
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:44,369
And the fact she can't talk to me
means there's a barrier between us.

375
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,788
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

376
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,872
I'm home.

377
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,165
-We were just--
-Welcome back.

378
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,042
-What?
-We were just talking about you.

379
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,419
I heard Misaki's cries.

380
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,047
Misaki is frustrated.

381
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,591
-I'm not frustrated.
-With Hikaru?

382
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,554
-With Hikaru?
-Not with Hikaru. With you.

383
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,556
-Me?
-I'm sorry...

384
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,975
She asked what we talked about last night.

385
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:11,980
I told her a little bit.
She's upset you didn't tell her.

386
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,192
I pretty much tell you everything.

387
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:20,363
So I'm wondering
why you couldn't tell me how you feel.

388
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,618
If I always tell you
about every little thing that piles up...

389
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,245
you wouldn't like it.

390
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,956
But you're...

391
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,251
not saying enough.

392
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:38,716
Yesterday,
after talking to Hansan about it,

393
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,053
he made me feel okay
about talking more openly.

394
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,932
So I was planning on telling you.

395
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,935
It just so happened Hansan was there.

396
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,521
It's not because I felt like
I couldn't open up to you.

397
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,691
Okay.

398
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,944
He winked at me.

399
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,532
I wanted to ask Arman something.

400
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:07,745
Seeing Arisa, who's the same age as you,
work extremely hard,

401
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:11,915
and to hear
that she's leaving <i>Terrace House...</i>

402
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,752
have you thought about
what you're going to do?

403
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:18,839
I wanted to ask you, too.
Did you have a goal in mind?

404
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,926
No, my life has been about
going with the flow.

405
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,680
-I like it.
-If there's a wave, I'll ride it.

406
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:29,099
-You'll ride the wave if it comes?
-So Hawaiian.

407
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,976
That's so Hawaiian.

408
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,397
But I respect Arisa
for working toward her dreams.

409
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,481
I think it's great.

410
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:42,362
But my happiness isn't based
on material things or money.

411
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,989
What is it then?

412
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:48,952
If I can surf every morning
and be able to come home to my family...

413
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,622
then I'll be happy.

414
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,541
That's true.

415
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,417
That's enough for me.

416
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,961
-That's true.
-This is my first time hearing that.

417
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,213
Yeah, but it's nice.

418
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,717
DAIKANYAMA, TOKYO

419
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,052
EXHIBITION

420
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,762
There's a lot we couldn't finish,

421
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,723
but my goal is for the guests
to enjoy their time here.

422
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:14,937
Let's not forget to smile and interact
for the next couple of days.

423
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,231
I'm looking forward to working with you.

424
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,379
-It's done.
-Yay!

425
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,299
-It's done, but...
-I'm excited.

426
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,177
-Maybe you shouldn't look.
-I want to see.

427
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,264
-It looks so cool!
-Squint when you look at it.

428
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,808
Thank you so much.

429
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:57,145
I think Hikaru and the others
will be here soon.

430
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,648
-I'll go in as a guest with everyone.
-That's true.

431
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:01,984
No more backstage work!

432
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,569
-Thank you!
-Good job.

433
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,738
-Thank you, Hansan.
-Good luck from now on.

434
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,447
-I sold one earlier.
-Seriously?

435
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:08,741
-Yeah.
-That's great!

436
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,158
My first sale.

437
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,745
-Amazing.
-That's great.

438
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:17,833
Saria.

439
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,546
Welcome.

440
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,508
Congratulations!

441
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,009
Thank you.

442
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:33,473
-Can I try these on?
-Of course.

443
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,478
-Doesn't she look cute?
-It's so cute!

444
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,355
-Come look.
-It looks good on you.

445
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,481
I want to pick one, too.

446
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,361
Don't be too critical.

447
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,988
It's cute.

448
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,573
Cute!

449
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:52,075
-That was quick.
-Don't smile.

450
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,828
-It's a good shape.
-She's gonna laugh.

451
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:57,330
-Saria?
-That's the second time.

452
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:58,791
What about me?
What'll look good on me?

453
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,709
For Hikaru...

454
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,587
-This is amazing.
-Wow!

455
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:07,174
-A white space.
-Yes, it's what you all painted.

456
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,635
-It's the ones we made!
-Yeah.

457
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,179
-Wow.
-Yeah, it's what you all made.

458
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,599
-It's amazing.
-It's so stylish now.

459
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:18,769
It's nice, three guys with hats.

460
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,230
You guys look good.

461
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,318
No one's taking it off.

462
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,528
Yeah.

463
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,487
-They look good.
-Yeah.

464
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:31,907
-Amazing.
-Incredible.

465
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,366
It's amazing.

466
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,493
You made so many.

467
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:38,288
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

468
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,710
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

469
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,086
Thank you.

470
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,465
-I'm glad.
-Yeah.

471
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,682
-The exhibit is done.
-Yeah, it's over.

472
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,810
That means...

473
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,895
I'm trying not to think about it.

474
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,233
How are you two doing?

475
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,776
Nothing's happened.

476
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,153
-You haven't gone out since then?
-No.

477
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:13,741
But we've been talking about
going somewhere.

478
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:17,369
Where are you going?
Have you decided yet?

479
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,330
Maybe the hot springs.

480
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,249
But I don't like co-ed baths.

481
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,959
-You don't? Why?
-No.

482
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,254
I don't want to go to a co-ed hot spring
when we're not even going out yet.

483
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,839
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,924
I think that's normal.

485
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,345
Is it?
You wanted to go to a co-ed bath?

486
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,347
No, I wasn't thinking about it.

487
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,432
I'd be pretty hurt if it were me.

488
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:40,518
-No way.
-Yeah.

489
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,935
This is what I mean!

490
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,731
What is that supposed to mean?

491
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:51,111
You need to learn more from Hansan.
You really should.

492
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:56,700
So you don't like co-ed baths.

493
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,703
But isn't it okay with someone you like?

494
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:01,789
Did I say I like her?

495
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:08,754
I wouldn't know.
That's between the two of you.

496
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,380
-He hasn't.
-No?

497
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,967
He hasn't said anything,
so I have no idea how Hikaru feels.

498
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,344
Yeah.

499
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,727
I'm gonna go shower. See ya.

500
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:26,229
-Good night.
-See ya, good night.

501
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:35,322
It's been like this
between the two of us lately.

502
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,990
No way.

503
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,617
Really.

504
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,452
Are you okay after what he said?

505
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,833
There were at least two things
that would've bothered me.

506
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,669
At least two.

507
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,589
I don't think he likes me.

508
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,508
-Why don't you just ask?
-I don't want to.

509
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:55,676
Why?

510
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,722
I don't want to think about it right now.

511
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,265
None of it.

512
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,108
What should be done, Tokui?

513
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:15,195
If the two of them continue to fight...

514
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,365
Misaki might say she's tired of it.

515
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:22,369
Hikaru says the wrong things
when he's upset.

516
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,372
That personality won't change easily.

517
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,207
That's true.

518
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,585
He's too sensitive.

519
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:35,173
As for the co-ed baths,
he didn't need to say he didn't want to.

520
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,299
That's right.

521
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,971
Misaki is cute.
She should be more clever

522
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,975
about directing him and making him
want to do things.

523
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,020
I think someone older
would be better for Misaki.

524
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,438
-She needs a 60-year-old.
-A 60-year-old?

525
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,315
-That old?
-Yeah.

526
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,151
-Otherwise...
-Retired?

527
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,612
Both of them are immature.

528
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,322
They fight over every little thing.

529
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,366
So the two of them make a perfect balance

530
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:05,538
to the love triangle between Natsumi,
Hansan and Hansan's girlfriend.

531
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,959
-I want to see both.
-Me too.

532
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,962
Yes, but what about
Arman's life philosophy?

533
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,089
Arman's life philosophy?

534
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,341
-He said it very clearly.
-Yes, he did.

535
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,678
"I go with the flow
and ride the wave when it comes."

536
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,765
"It's enough to have a family
waiting at home."

537
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:29,853
Maybe he has something we've forgotten
growing up and living in Japan.

538
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:34,482
-As someone who grew up in Hawaii.
-Hansan got that, too.

539
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:39,029
That's why at the end
he said, "Yeah, it's nice."

540
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,031
But I wonder if I could say nice.

541
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:46,704
Oh, but it was a rather dramatic night.

542
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,913
Wasn't it?

543
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,373
All three girls cried.

544
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,125
It was very emotional.

545
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,460
But Arisa will be leaving.

546
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,045
-Yes.
-The exhibit is over.

547
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,547
She worked hard.

548
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,381
Will a new member appear now?

549
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,643
Hot!

550
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,862
Thank you for your help.

551
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:25,784
-Looks good.
-Lasagna for my gratitude.

552
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,494
-Wow.
-Smells good.

553
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,371
It looks delicious.

554
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,957
Thank you, everyone,
for helping with my exhibit.

555
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,751
Of course!

556
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,878
It helped me a lot.

557
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,338
Ready? Bon appétit!

558
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,634
Have some.

559
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,552
Did you make this from powder?

560
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:45,638
No.

561
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,515
-What do you mean by powder?
-It's tasty.

562
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:48,766
It's good.

563
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,770
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

564
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,438
What's this?
It looks super good.

565
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:58,567
It's my way of saying thank you
for helping me.

566
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:00,235
Really?

567
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,904
This isn't enough then.

568
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,447
I knew you'd say that.

569
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,702
I'm glad I got to see the exhibit.

570
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:12,623
-You really came alive.
-It was really cool.

571
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,125
I thought it was like
a grand gesture of departure.

572
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:24,176
But you worked really hard
and made it happen.

573
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,720
And I know you were busy,

574
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:30,849
but seeing the final result
made me really understand.

575
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,063
I've decided to leave.

576
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,108
But every day has been fun.

577
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:42,653
At times I wasn't sure
if coming here was a good idea,

578
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,488
but right now I'm truly grateful.

579
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,284
It's like I have another home.
I'm so happy.

580
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:54,582
To be honest, I never thought
I'd not want to leave.

581
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,794
I'm going to keep working hard
so you'll say that I'm doing my best.

582
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,422
I hope you guys work hard, too.

583
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,092
Thank you.

584
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:19,189
We all made this for you.

585
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:22,150
-What's this?
-It's for you.

586
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,365
I don't remember when we took these.

587
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:34,037
It brings back memories.

588
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,124
Arman, I can't read English!

589
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:48,886
Will you read it, Arman?

590
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:59,021
No, not in English!
In Japanese!

591
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,984
"Thank you for all the great memories.

592
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:08,446
Continue to pursue your dream.

593
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,074
Good luck."

594
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,576
Thank you.

595
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,289
Thank you.

596
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,506
-See you, Arisa.
-See you!

597
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,928
Thank you.

598
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,764
Thank you.

599
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,809
Good luck.

600
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,063
-Bye, Arisa!
-Bye!

601
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,480
-See you later!
-Good luck.

602
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:43,982
-Bye!
-Bye!

603
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,033
NAGOYA, AICHI

604
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,455
-You've packed everything?
-Yeah.

605
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,916
-Will you double-check for me later?
-Sure.

606
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,127
You'll be okay in Tokyo?

607
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:07,923
I didn't think I'd leave you so soon, Mom.

608
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,132
Seriously.

609
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,052
You can come home anytime.

610
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,262
Yeah, I will.

611
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,641
Will you be okay living with boys?

612
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,434
I won't be okay.

613
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,229
I wonder if you'll find someone you like.

614
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,523
That would be nice.

615
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:29,862
If I can grow in some way
or gain something there...

616
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:33,198
-I think you will.
-I think so, too.

617
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:36,118
And then if I can come home,
I'll be happy.

618
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,550
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

619
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,426
I'll go now.

620
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,513
-Call me anytime.
-Yeah.

621
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,515
Come home if you don't like it.

622
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,851
-Bye. Be careful.
-Bye.
