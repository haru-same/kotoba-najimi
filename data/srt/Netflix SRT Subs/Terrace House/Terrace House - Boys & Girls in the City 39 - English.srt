1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,684
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,226
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,938
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,398
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,276
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,822
A lot happened last week...

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,198
-Yes.
-Yes, indeed.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,577
For the issue between Rikopin and Hayato,

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,120
Rikopin apologized
and practically said she likes him.

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:42,793
{\an8}But maybe I gave you the idea
that I wasn't interested in you.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,295
{\an8}I hope not.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,172
{\an8}Because it's not true.

14
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,800
{\an8}But Hayato...

15
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,054
He's a little scared off right now.
He says they're on hold.

16
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,100
Even if we did, I wouldn't be sure
whether I can take things further.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,478
That's true.
You couldn't even hold hands.

18
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,313
It'd be like a school field trip again.

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,315
-And Momochan becomes...
-Congratulations.

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,900
...a professional ballerina.

21
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,903
We're so happy for her.

22
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,323
{\an8}I'll be a professional dancer
starting next week.

23
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,660
-Wow!
-Seriously?

24
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,121
-My dream came true.
-That's awesome.

25
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,415
Now she can enjoy her time
at <i>Terrace House.</i>

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,167
That's right. And now...

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,754
-The brand new...
-Misaki and Byrnes.

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,465
A simple occurrence.
He fails to get his license.

29
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,593
{\an8}<i>-On Misaki's birthday.</i>
<i>-I suppose it was significant.</i>

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,556
{\an8}But later at the party,
he gives her a dress.

31
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,977
<i>-That was nice.</i>
<i>-But afterward...</i>

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,604
That was great.
Let's see it again.

33
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,773
They're unstoppable.

34
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,775
-Can we see that part again?
-Can we?

35
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,484
Can we run that scene?

36
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,029
{\an8}As long as it's not Yokohama or Shonan.

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,906
{\an8}You don't want to go there that bad?

38
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,991
{\an8}I feel like it's bad luck.

39
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,326
{\an8}Even if you went with a different guy?

40
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,622
{\an8}"Even if you went with a different guy?"
The title for Kazumasa Oda's new single.

41
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,752
{\an8}-Here it comes.
-It's happening.

42
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,878
{\an8}"Don't stare at me..."

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,713
{\an8}Don't stare at me.

44
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,840
{\an8}And then...

45
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,094
{\an8}I like you, Misaki.

46
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,685
That carried weight.
It was the real deal.

47
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,603
-It was real.
-It was that thing where it just came out.

48
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,439
It just came out.

49
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,358
What a great moment.

50
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,736
I like you.

51
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,615
She's gonna file a complaint.

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,163
Oh, man! You lied, Byrnes!
It doesn't work!

53
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,084
I'm sure it drove the older ladies crazy.

54
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,587
And he tried to lead it into a kiss.

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,798
But he was rejected.

56
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,637
It's only gonna be on your forehead.

57
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,851
-Just your forehead...
-Wait, wait.

58
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,561
-Wait, I'm not ready...
-I'm like the weird guy.

59
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,899
But Misaki seemed happy.

60
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,236
She was like, "Wait, you go ahead."

61
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,115
Isn't it a bold move
to go for a kiss so soon?

62
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,827
Isn't it a turn off?
Like, "Who does this guy think he is?"

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,829
Didn't she say something like that
at the end?

64
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,956
-Not at all.
-No?

65
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,540
I see.

66
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,335
I guess I am clueless.

67
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,880
What's wrong?

68
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,133
There Triendl goes again.

69
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,343
I was just playing it over again
in my head.

70
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,097
-What?
-Byrnes and Misaki?

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,767
-It's so nice, isn't it?
-It is.

72
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,769
The golden days of summer.

73
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,523
-Summer is here, old man.
-It's summer.

74
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,125
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

75
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,921
-You're cleaning up?
-Yeah.

76
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,048
Thanks. I'll help you.

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,267
I'm gonna have some cake from yesterday.

78
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,726
Seriously?

79
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,855
You can eat that now?

80
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,481
Totally.

81
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,030
-Did I seem drunk yesterday?
-Yeah.

82
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,740
Do you even remember what you said?

83
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,117
I do.

84
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,619
I see.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,584
It looked really good on you though.

86
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,336
-Thanks.
-The dress.

87
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,173
Really good.

88
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,512
It...

89
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,808
it just occurred to me...

90
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,478
it just occurred to me
that I was really happy.

91
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,195
-I'm gonna go shower.
-Okay.

92
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,738
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

93
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,282
-Thanks for cleaning up, too.
-Of course.

94
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,369
-See you.
-Bye.

95
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,252
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

96
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,173
{\an8}What about the new member
you were talking about?

97
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,093
{\an8}The new guy...

98
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:48,140
{\an8}definitely likes one of the other girls.

99
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,683
{\an8}So no real potential there?

100
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,685
{\an8}AYAKA NISHIDA
PART-TIMER

101
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,021
None.

102
00:05:55,855 --> 00:06:00,485
Did you go somewhere with the 29-year-old?

103
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,612
-I did.
-Seriously?

104
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,197
We went to Yokohama.

105
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,408
Did he make any moves?

106
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,410
Not at all.

107
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,329
If he asks you out again...

108
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,873
would you go?

109
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,958
I would.

110
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,672
-But I don't think he'll ask me out again.
-Really?

111
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,884
So I think I'll have to do something
about that.

112
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,681
I think that if you ask him out,

113
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,308
it'd make him happy.

114
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,018
-Really?
-Yeah.

115
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,978
What if he says no?

116
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,606
-Then...
-Like, "Sorry, I'm not feeling it."

117
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,527
-But things aren't awkward, right?
-Not at all.

118
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,820
So?

119
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,738
Yeah, I need to do something.

120
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,449
-Yeah, something.
-Something.

121
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,576
-I have to take action.
-Yeah.

{\an8}KYOZO MITANI
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR

131
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,257
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Hello.

132
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,177
{\an8}-Congratulations on the other day.
-Thank you so much.

133
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,304
-Please sit.
-Excuse me.

134
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,268
What did you think of the competition?

135
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,480
I wanted to make the top three...

136
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,983
I still feel a little frustrated.

137
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:07,529
Then your frustrations and your desire
to make the top three

138
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,698
can drive you further.

139
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,243
Watching you dance,

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,539
I felt that if you work hard,
you could potentially be better.

141
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,459
You have presence and you have the height.

142
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:25,505
That's what made me decide to accept you.

143
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,259
What you have inside of you,

144
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,305
you can express to the audience
through your dance.

145
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,184
So please work hard on your dancing.

146
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,811
Thank you.

147
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,022
Please do your best.
I'm looking forward to it.

148
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,607
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it too.

149
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,778
Your first class will be tomorrow,
so I'll come by to see.

150
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,324
Okay.

151
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,121
{\an8}So...

152
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,373
tomorrow morning...

153
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,710
I'll be leaving <i>Terrace House.</i>

154
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,796
-What? Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

155
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,383
I went to the new dance company today.

156
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,720
I went to talk and sign the contracts.

157
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,225
From now on,
everything's going to be ballet for me.

158
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:22,354
I need to be in an environment
where I can focus on dance.

159
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,816
I'll do my best.

160
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:32,114
-I understand.
-Yeah, your dream has come true.

161
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,118
If that's why you're leaving,
then we support you.

162
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,703
-We'll be rooting for you.
-Thank you.

163
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,416
I've only done ballet my entire life.

164
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,254
So my time here was so much fun.

165
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,759
Thank you.

166
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,636
Thank you.

167
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,099
Over these past two months,
you only had one day off.

168
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,642
Thank you for spending it with me.

169
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,063
-That's right, I only had one day off.
-Yeah, no fair.

170
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,525
-No fair!
-It's not fair, Arman.

171
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,985
-I didn't get to go out with you.
-Yeah.

172
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,655
-Thank you. It was fun.
-Thank you.

173
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:19,119
I've gone pro,
but I'm at the bottom of the ranks.

174
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,332
If I ever get to the middle...

175
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,378
I'll invite you guys to a performance.
So please come see me.

176
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,672
I'll go even if you're at the bottom.

177
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,133
Yeah, totally.

178
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,177
-We want to see.
-Really?

179
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,943
{\an8}I'm off.

180
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,322
{\an8}-Good luck.
-Thank you.

181
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,406
{\an8}See you.

182
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,368
-I'll be going.
-Good luck.

183
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,246
-I'm going.
-See you.

184
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,084
-I'll be going.
-Thanks.

185
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,461
Thanks.

186
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,089
I'll be going.

187
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,800
-Do your best.
-Thank you.

188
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,469
He's carrying all my stuff.

189
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,972
-See you.
-See you.

190
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,853
Thank you, guys.

191
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,063
-Work hard.
-Do your best!

192
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,323
{\an8}EBISU, TOKYO

193
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,745
-Starting this week, I won't be alone.
-Are you going somewhere?

194
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,038
-I'll be living at <i>Terrace House.</i>
-What?

195
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,084
-What?
-You think I'm lying, don't you?

196
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,794
You think I'm lying.

197
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,297
Are you serious?
That's unexpected.

198
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,967
-I haven't had a boyfriend for a year.
-That's true, you haven't.

199
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,220
-I fall for guys pretty quickly though.
-Yeah, you do.

200
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,224
-You didn't have to agree.
-You do, though.

201
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,852
But somehow it never works out.

202
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,646
-Seriously though?
-Yeah.

203
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,023
Are you gonna be able to get along
with the others?

204
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,528
-Because I'm a brat?
-Yeah.

205
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,364
Don't agree with me!

206
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,991
But yeah, I do fall for guys easily.

207
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,911
-I have a feeling it'll happen quickly.
-Oh, yeah?

208
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,705
Yeah, real quick.

209
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,921
I see. I thought she'd stick around
to enjoy her time at <i>Terrace House.</i>

210
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,215
But she is a professional now.
There's no need for her to stay.

211
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,217
They mentioned it in passing,
but I didn't realize

212
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,679
she only had one day off
during her two months there.

213
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,472
What a waste!

214
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,267
I mean, she spent it seeing
the comedy duo Earth with Arman.

215
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,019
What a waste.

216
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,272
-What a waste!
-Such a waste!

217
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,651
And things between Byrnes and Misaki...

218
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,112
I guess things are good.
I didn't need to worry.

219
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,074
Very natural.
That exchange of, "Do you remember?"

220
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,701
"I remember."

221
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,330
And the way he said it.
It wasn't just, "I remember," but...

222
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:13,292
"I remember."
The tone shows that he meant what he said.

223
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,711
Right?

224
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,505
Yes, he said that part seriously.

225
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,592
But he then lightened it up with,
"You looked good in the dress."

226
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,011
{\an8}He's made us forget about Hansan.

227
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,973
{\an8}-So you've recovered from the Han-loss?
-I have.

228
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,061
-We've got a new member.
-Yes, a new member.

229
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,064
She might not fit in with the group.

230
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,486
{\an8}Yes, she's energetic, like Hana Imai.

231
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,196
{\an8}Seems like we've got a crass one.

232
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,198
If she falls for guys quickly, then...

233
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:48,202
-What if she goes for Byrnes?
-It'd get complicated.

234
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,996
It'd be perfect if she went for Arman.

235
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,581
-You want her to go for Arman?
-Yeah.

236
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,332
You're a fan of Arman.

237
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,959
-Yeah, you root for him.
-You like him?

238
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,837
Isn't he good?
He doesn't usually say anything wrong.

239
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,215
He doesn't,
but only because he doesn't say anything.

240
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,177
{\an8}I hope we get to see her friend more too.

241
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,679
{\an8}Yeah, to come visit the house.

242
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,181
She looks like she'd own a chameleon.

243
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,058
She does seem like she would have
a pet reptile!

244
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,478
"They feel so good because they're cold,"
she'd say.

245
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,442
{\an8}What happened with the license, Yuuki?

246
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,943
{\an8}Oh, no!

247
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,613
I'm going back next week.

248
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,948
-It's stuck.
-It's sticking.

249
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,158
You should push it back once.

250
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,993
I want to hurry up and drive.

251
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,829
The doorbell rang.

252
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,289
Let's all go.

253
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,709
-Everyone?
-Just Yuuki and me then.

254
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,964
-Is it a girl?
-Of course it's gonna be a girl.

255
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,090
Yes?

256
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,302
<i>I'm moving in today.</i>

257
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,262
Sure, come on in.

258
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,272
Wait, I'm gonna sit here.

259
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,357
How about we immediately
play a game with her?

260
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,694
Like, "Here, roll the dice."

261
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,114
-Hello, sorry for interrupting.
-Hello.

262
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,240
-Hello.
-Hello.

263
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,618
I'm sorry I'm so slow.
My luggage is very heavy.

264
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,994
Don't worry about it.

265
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,872
-You can leave it there.
-Is it okay?

266
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,709
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

267
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,002
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

268
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,089
I'm Masako Endo and I'm 22.

269
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,382
-Nice to meet you.
-What do you do?

270
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,761
I usually model.

271
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,139
-Thanks for having me.
-Nice to meet you.

272
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,308
-You seem nervous.
-I am.

273
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,686
-You are.
-Are you from Kansai?

274
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,395
-From Fukuoka.
-Oh, Fukuoka.

275
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,148
-Fukuoka's nice.
-You've got the accent.

276
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,818
-Yes, I do.
-Yeah.

277
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,487
How long have you been in Tokyo?

278
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,655
This is my fourth year.

279
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,701
-You were in Fukuoka before that?
-Yes, in Fukuoka.

280
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,456
I'm actually half-Japanese as well.
I'm half-Filipino.

281
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,959
We're getting more people
with strong features.

282
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,670
-Very strong features.
-Very strong features.

283
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,213
Would you like something to drink?

284
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,882
-Maybe a highball?
-May I?

285
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,134
-How about a beer?
-We've got beer.

286
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,219
Oh, thank you.

287
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,598
-Was it Endo...
-Masako Endo.

288
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,142
It doesn't match my face, I know.
You just smirked.

289
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,896
-He totally smirked!
-I was just thinking of what to call you.

290
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,941
I go by Martha at work.

291
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,818
Martha?

292
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,029
Masako, Martha, either is fine.

293
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,072
-Then here's to Martha.
-To Martha.

294
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,909
-Thank you. It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

295
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,495
-Nice to have you.
-Nice to have you.

296
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,121
-Your drink's almost done.
-It's okay.

297
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,165
-To Martha.
-Martha.

298
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,167
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

299
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,295
Can you speak Tagalog?

300
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,380
Yes, I speak Tagalog.

301
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,301
-Any plans for the future?
-The future?

302
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,637
-You're asking that, Arman?
-It's so sudden.

303
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,598
-What? I'm curious.
-Future goals...

304
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,684
My goal is to be happy.

305
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,103
Happy? That sounds familiar.

306
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,313
Who said that?

307
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,106
She's the girl version of Arman.

308
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,027
-Nice.
-I think we'll get along.

309
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:15,785
I studied childcare for three years
in high school.

310
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,664
I went to a junior college
and dropped out after a year.

311
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,834
I had to move to Tokyo
for my modeling career.

312
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,170
So I did have the dream
of working with kids, you know?

313
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,799
-Your dream.
-Yeah, my dream.

314
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,928
I heard you can get certified
without going to school,

315
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,387
so I wanted to get certified--

316
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,264
So you want that,
but you're modeling in the meantime.

317
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,390
-That's right.
-I see.

318
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,810
{\an8}MASAKO ENDO, 22 YEARS OLD
MODEL, ASPIRING CHILDCARE WORKER

319
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,604
{\an8}-She has it planned out.
-Yeah.

320
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,480
Do you like to clean?

321
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:49,861
I'm not OCD, so I'm not super clean.

322
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,487
-That's good.
-Yeah, that's good.

323
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,155
-Do you like things neat?
-Not really.

324
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,158
I cleaned a little when Nacchan was here.

325
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,745
-Oh, she said it.
-Quietly.

326
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,122
Say it out loud, Riko.

327
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,999
-Say it out loud.
-It's okay.

328
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,751
Do you have a boyfriend?

329
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,919
No, I haven't had one for about a year.

330
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,005
What's your type?

331
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,508
None of the guys I've dated
were the same type.

332
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,636
So I don't really have a type.

333
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,640
But if there's even one thing
I can admire about him...

334
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,474
then I'd find him attractive.

335
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,229
-But someone I can be comfortable with.
-That's true.

336
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,565
-So whoever you fall for is your type.
-Yes.

337
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,942
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

338
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,239
-Do you want to see the girls' room?
-If you don't mind.

339
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,949
Need help with your luggage?

340
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,201
-We have the elevator.
-Okay.

341
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:43,623
-I'll take you.
-I'm going to go see the room then.

342
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,332
Thank you.

343
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,376
Thank you?

344
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,378
Are you leaving or something?

345
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,214
My luggage is crazy heavy.

346
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,467
-It's nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you too.

347
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,762
I'm so nervous.

348
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,682
Is this your first time
living with others?

349
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,894
I have lived with a friend before.

350
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,147
We fought almost every day.

351
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,526
Because of a difference in lifestyle?

352
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,655
Apparently I'm pretty whimsical.

353
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,364
Apparently.

354
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,658
Um, so...

355
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,368
-You go ahead.
-It's okay.

356
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,750
Inspiration... Is it inspiration?
Or how do you say it?

357
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,461
-First impression?
-Yes! Yes that's what I meant.

358
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,879
My first impressions?

359
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,131
At a quick glance...

360
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,593
I liked Hayato.

361
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,265
Why? Why?

362
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,934
What's with that reaction?

363
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,979
Is that bad? Am I not allowed?

364
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,272
No, no...

365
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,275
She's laughing like crazy.

366
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,945
-No, I thought maybe it was Arman.
-Calm down.

367
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,905
How old is he?

368
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,241
-Twenty-nine?
-Twenty-nine.

369
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,368
That's totally fine.

370
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,747
-You like older men?
-I tend to like older guys.

371
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,791
-So the guys you've dated before...
-Mostly older.

372
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,544
What about you two?

373
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,922
I wonder...

374
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,884
Is it better if I don't ask?

375
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,511
We'll take it one step at a time.

376
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,221
Hayato's attractive.

377
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,099
Isn't he?

378
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,643
You keep laughing.

379
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,745
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

380
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,455
-Are you cleaning up?
-Yeah.

381
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,457
So many dishes...

382
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,835
There are so many dishes.

383
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,711
-Can I help?
-It's okay.

384
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,548
-You sure?
-Don't worry about it. Please sit.

385
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,676
-Do you want some coffee?
-I'd love some.

386
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,847
I couldn't sleep at all.

387
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,060
I've got a hangover.

388
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,023
-It's my own fault.
-Your own fault.

389
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,943
-Good morning.
-Oh, coffee.

390
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,319
-Want some?
-Yeah.

391
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,696
-Is this okay?
-Sure.

392
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,281
Good morning...

393
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,326
-Arman.
-My head hurts.

394
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,746
I'm fine.
I couldn't sleep much though.

395
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,374
-The first day...
-What?

396
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,335
I can't hear.

397
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,879
-It's hard to sleep the first night.
-Yeah, it is.

398
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,506
-Do you have work today?
-No.

399
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,384
-My mom is visiting from Fukuoka today.
-So you're gonna see her?

400
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,220
-Yeah, I'm gonna see her.
-Nice.

401
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,430
-Do you have work today, Hayato?
-I do.

402
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,016
You start late, right?

403
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,685
Yeah, I'll leave around 3:00 p.m.

404
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,938
3:00 p.m.? Wanna have lunch then?

405
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,733
It's a nice day today.
We should all go in the pool.

406
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,277
Will the other girls join?

407
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,905
-Let's ask them.
-Okay.

408
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,915
Ready?

409
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,126
They're here.

410
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,423
Let's all go in.

411
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,136
-I'm scared.
-I'm starting to get nervous.

412
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,512
-No way.
-A little bit.

413
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,973
Are we all going in together?

414
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,476
Ready?

415
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,270
It's my first time.

416
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,648
I hate this part, having to jump in.

417
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,816
-I'll help you.
-That's okay.

418
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,829
It's freezing!
It's super cold.

419
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,541
It's not warm at all!

420
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,922
Can you doggy paddle?

421
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,509
It's really like a dog.

422
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,512
It's been a while for me.

423
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,556
-A race?
-Yeah, doggy paddle race.

424
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,974
Ready? Go!

425
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,062
He's good.

426
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,233
He's good.

427
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,321
Is that normal swimming?

428
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,364
What? That was fine.

429
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,034
I lost.

430
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,537
Should we head back in?

431
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,626
It's freezing.

432
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,302
What's your schedule usually like?

433
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,305
My schedule's all over the place.

434
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,182
Sometimes I get called in
at the last minute.

435
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,185
It happens pretty often.

436
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,315
-When you're free, we should go out.
-Sure.

437
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,942
Where do you normally go?

438
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,654
Nowhere in particular.
Depends on how I'm feeling.

439
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,491
Okay.

440
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,576
You can leave it to me.

441
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,333
-Masako Endo.
-She's here.

442
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,669
-She's bright and cheerful.
-She's cute and energetic.

443
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,672
-And her goal is also to be happy.
-Yes, her goal for the future.

444
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,549
Who would've guessed?

445
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,177
But she likes Hayato.

446
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,389
But Arman asked her out.

447
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,808
-I wonder if she's Arman's type.
-He did seem interested.

448
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,772
-Love triangle?
-Things have been steady until now.

449
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,566
Speaking of steady,
Arman's doggy paddle...

450
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,068
That was impressive.

451
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,736
His head never wavered.

452
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,781
Just like that.

453
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,909
It's like there was a motor underneath.

454
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,161
Yeah!

455
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,829
The doggy paddle looks a little scary
when it's done too well.

456
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,082
Scary.

457
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,458
But maybe...

458
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:07,506
Masako talked about how she might find
one thing she could admire in a guy.

459
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,051
Maybe that qualifies.

460
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,011
-No way.
-You think she admires that?

461
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,056
The steadiness of his doggy paddle?

462
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,224
Would she really?

463
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,643
Admirable doggy paddling, happy...

464
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,895
-Nice physique.
-Nice physique.

465
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,939
"I meet all her qualifications."

466
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,358
-Oh, you mean Arman thinks that.
-Yes, from Arman's view.

467
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,694
What will Rikopin do now?

468
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:33,990
-It might push her to ask Hayato out.
-Hopefully.

469
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,618
And if Hayato makes any strange moves,

470
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:41,207
{\an8}then Martha's friend is going to appear.

471
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,334
{\an8}Like, "Hold on a sec, hold on.

472
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,461
{\an8}I just heard."

473
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,589
{\an8}I want to go in the pool every day.

474
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,676
{\an8}-Maybe I'll go again today.
-But it was surprisingly cold.

475
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,680
It was warm at first, but it got cold.

476
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,641
It feels like a vacation.

477
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,228
Are you off?
You're going to work, right?

478
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,439
-No, I'm going to see my mom.
-Right, your mom.

479
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,898
How many siblings do you have?

480
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,859
-I'm an only child.
-An only child.

481
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,861
What do you usually do on your day off?

482
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,322
I usually go to the gym.

483
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,282
Oh, you work out.

484
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,742
We should go together next time.

485
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
-Is there a gym close by?
-Yeah.

486
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,287
I want to go.

487
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,164
Maybe I'll head to the convenience store.

488
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,125
-For breakfast?
-Yeah.

489
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,168
I'm gonna go.

490
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,212
See you later.

491
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,838
I'm gonna go shower.

492
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,634
I'm going to do laundry.

493
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,974
-Earlier...
-What?

494
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,309
Earlier...

495
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:49,275
I didn't expect Arman to ask me out
on a date on the first day.

496
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,735
Is that usually how it is?

497
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,946
-Like, to do something?
-To go somewhere.

498
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,115
I think.
I don't remember exactly.

499
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,952
-Did he say where?
-I asked him where he usually goes.

500
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,665
He said it depends
and to just leave it to him.

501
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,836
-Really? So you said yes?
-What?

502
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,464
-You said yes?
-Yeah, I did.

503
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,634
There's no reason for me to say no.

504
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,678
Right?

505
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,555
A date...

506
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,307
-Is it?
-So you're going.

507
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,724
Is it a date?

508
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:27,729
But yesterday, you know how girls talk?

509
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,774
They asked me who I liked
based on first impressions,

510
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,527
-and I said you.
-No way.

511
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,822
-But they laughed at me.
-Who did? Misaki, right?

512
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,032
-She was laughing so hard.
-Misaki?

513
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,784
I was like, "Why are you laughing?"

514
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,079
-I see.
-Yeah.

515
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,208
Do you cook?

516
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,668
Well...

517
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,547
when I used to live with my boyfriend,

518
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,090
-I did most of the cooking.
-Really?

519
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,511
-But I'm sure it doesn't compare to you.
-No...

520
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,305
Teach me something.

521
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,849
-Sure.
-Let's see...

522
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,644
What would you recommend that's easy?

523
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,355
I'll think about it.

524
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,942
But for now, since Arman asked,
I'll go out with him.

525
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,945
That's good.

526
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,322
-It's good.
-It's good.

527
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,740
It's good.

528
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,951
It's all good.
