1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,642
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,268
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,104
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,816
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,443
There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,321
-Well, let's see...
-What happened?

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,617
It seemed like Hikaru and Misaki
were gonna be the cute couple,

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,955
but it seems like Hikaru's trying
to distance himself from her.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
"Did I say I like her?"

11
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,835
-He did say that.
-And "I don't like co-ed baths."

12
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,921
-He made several cold comments.
-That's right.

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,841
Where are you going?
Have you decided yet?

14
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,759
Maybe the hot springs.

15
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,595
But I don't like co-ed baths.

16
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,429
-You don't?
-No.

17
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,389
But isn't it okay with someone you like?

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,975
Did I say I like her?

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,021
-What was that about?
-I don't know.

20
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:07,400
What's going on?
Did he have a change of heart?

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,862
-And that's how things ended.
-Yes, that's right.

22
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,780
We were left wondering
why Hikaru was acting like a brat.

23
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,907
-And...
-That's right!

24
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,951
-...the other drama.
-There was, wasn't there?

25
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,079
The beginning of the affair.

26
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,664
-We got to witness it.
-Yes.

27
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,291
-The how-to guide to cheating.
-The how-to guide to cheating.

28
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,460
Please don't try this at home.

29
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:29,131
I can't go fishing with you
if it's just the two of us.

30
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,133
I had promised my girlfriend...

31
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,511
What's wrong?

32
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,012
Oh...

33
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,183
It's nothing.

34
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,686
Are you okay?
Something's bothering you.

35
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,397
Yeah, I am.

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,940
Let's get a drink.

37
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,984
-Right now?
-Yeah, let's go now.

38
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,277
Okay.

39
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,572
-That makes me so happy.
-Let's go.

40
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:57,868
From Hansan's girlfriend's
point of view...

41
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,704
It wouldn't be surprising
if she considered that cheating.

42
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,499
Just because he turned down fishing
doesn't mean it's all okay.

43
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:09,087
It's like he turned down fishing,
so he feels like he did what he needed to.

44
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,715
As for the rest,
well, whatever happens, happens.

45
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,843
He's popular with the ladies, so...

46
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,430
maybe he's a player.

47
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,808
-No.
-I'm making a statement.

48
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,062
I'm proposing the theory
that Handa is a player.

49
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:31,318
Nacchan was slightly attracted...

50
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,197
If I were to use a fishing analogy,
the hook is in her mouth.

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,076
Now it depends on
whether he's gonna reel her in.

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,703
That's right.

53
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,955
We might be able to see that moment.

54
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,749
And the hat left...

55
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,168
Yes, she took off her hat.

56
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,422
-She did take off her hat and leave.
-"Thank you."

57
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,132
-See you, Arisa.
-See you!

58
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,676
-See you later!
-Good luck.

59
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,927
-Bye!
-Bye!

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,806
And then we got to see
the bottom half of the new member's face.

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,809
She seems so young.

62
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,061
-The mom seemed young too.
-Right?

63
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
-Call me anytime.
-Yeah.

64
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,107
Come home if you don't like it.

65
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,276
-Bye. Be careful.
-Bye.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,740
I'm just going to say this now.
I've already met this person.

67
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,282
What's with you?

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,663
Why are you looking at me
as if I've stalked her or something?

69
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:28,792
No, I met her on the job
at the Girls Award fashion show.

70
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,923
I was told to go to the press conference,
and I wondered who this person was.

71
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,260
That's when they told me
she's about to join <i>Terrace House.</i>

72
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,347
And I was like, "What? You're joining?"

73
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,143
You're going to be really surprised
when you see her personal profile.

74
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,811
Seriously?

75
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,648
It's like, "Wow, someone like that
is finally joining <i>Terrace House?"</i>

76
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,527
-What?
-Her job résumé or her profile.

77
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,112
What?

78
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,919
-Working tomorrow?
-No, not tomorrow.

79
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,379
-What about you, Hikaru?
-Construction work.

80
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,464
What are those pants called?

81
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,593
-Chocho Longs.
-They look really cool.

82
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,888
-They're not that cool.
-You looked really cool.

83
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,222
Right?

84
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,602
-I looked cool?
-You did.

85
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,145
-I looked cool?
-You did.

86
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,774
-I looked that cool?
-Yes! Don't make me keep repeating it.

87
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,193
-You should wear them.
-Me? Wear them?

88
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,279
-Yeah, you wear stuff like that at home.
-You're terrible!

89
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,785
-What are your plans tomorrow, Nacchan?
-I'm going to Osaka.

90
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,369
-For four days?
-Yeah.

91
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,125
-That made me jump!
-That made my heart jump!

92
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,670
Let's go see.

93
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:56,964
You wanna come?

94
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,843
-Oh, man! Oh, man!
-I'm starting to get nervous.

95
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:05,806
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, I'm moving in today.</i>

96
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,474
-Okay.
-Please come in.

97
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,851
Her voice sounds cute.

98
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,939
-Oh, she's got short hair.
-It's short.

99
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,817
-Hi.
-Come in, come in.

100
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,819
She's cute!

101
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,989
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,580
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

103
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,082
-Please sit.
-Excuse me.

104
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,338
I'm Riko Nagai.

105
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,757
-Riko Nagai?
-Yes.

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,509
-Rikochan?
-Yes.

107
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,553
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,972
-Please come sit.
-Yes.

109
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,808
-She's so cute. So young.
-She looks young.

110
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,977
Are you around 18?

111
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,605
-Yes, I'm 18.
-No way!

112
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,108
-Are you in your first year of college?
-I'm in my third year of high school.

113
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,402
-You're a high school student?
-Yes.

114
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,613
Have you graduated already?

115
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,616
It's an online school,
so I have another year.

116
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,201
I'll do the last year while working.

117
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,912
RIKO NAGAI, 18 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

118
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,580
-While working?
-Yes.

119
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,206
What do you do?

120
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,087
Last week I won a beauty contest.

121
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,091
I don't know where that will lead to.
I'm not sure yet.

122
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,594
Was it a beauty contest
at your high school?

123
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:29,181
No, it was a national contest.
Do you know it?

124
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,766
-You won the grand prize?
-Yes.

125
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,934
Whoa, that's serious.

126
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,770
-Wow.
-That's amazing.

127
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,396
Where are you from?

128
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,856
I'm from Aichi.

129
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,025
-Oh, Nagoya!
-Yes.

130
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,861
What made you come to <i>Terrace House?</i>

131
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:46,406
I wanted to live in Tokyo.

132
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,867
So this is
your first time living in Tokyo?

133
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,203
-Yes.
-Wow!

134
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,789
I've been living with my mom,
just the two of us.

135
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:59,628
I've never lived with strangers
or any guys before,

136
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,338
so...

137
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm a little worried.

138
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,554
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Not for two years.

139
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:13,726
I'm not even really sure
I know what a relationship is right now.

140
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,645
She's 18!

141
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,647
I think you should do what you want.

142
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,734
Have you turned into old ladies now?

143
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:27,531
I mean, she's 18!
She doesn't even know what love is!

144
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,908
I'm sorry I put it that way.

145
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,326
I'm really...

146
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,167
It's so nice.

147
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:44,757
It seems like she hasn't met
too many foreigners or mixed people.

148
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,675
I should've hidden my tattoo.
She looked scared.

149
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,301
She never looked me in the eyes.

150
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,264
She probably was scared.
She was probably thinking, "Oh, no!"

151
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,978
I suddenly feel really old.

152
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,980
I don't mean you, Nacchan.

153
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,190
I haven't said anything.

154
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,235
-Are you okay with the Osaka accent?
-Of course.

155
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,237
Are you making fun of me?

156
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,784
What if I asked,
"Are you okay with the Hokkaido dialect?"

157
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,451
That's not what I meant!

158
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,332
You know, the Kansai dialect can be
a little blunt.

159
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,668
Are you okay?

160
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,379
I prefer it
when people are straight with me.

161
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,714
-I'm glad.
-Yes.

162
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,551
Is there something you want to do here?

163
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:35,098
I'd like to meet people I can trust here.
I thought that would be nice.

164
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:40,646
Since I don't know many people in Tokyo,
and everything is so new to me,

165
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,483
I'd like to build relationships
like that here.

166
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,570
Are you looking to find love, too?

167
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,406
That would be nice, too.

168
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,285
I do have an ideal type.

169
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,331
Someone funny and tall.

170
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
What about looks?

171
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,087
Of course I'd prefer someone good looking.

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,425
But for now, he just needs to be tall.

173
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,681
I feel like there aren't too many people
who are both tall and good-looking.

174
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,807
That's true.

175
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,851
Are you excited?

176
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,894
I am.

177
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:26,108
Before I came, I was really worried.
Now that I'm here, I'm excited.

RIKO NAGAI, 18 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

184
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,614
What are you doing tomorrow?

185
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:18,536
I don't have plans tomorrow,
so I was going to buy things I need.

186
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,205
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back, Hansan.

187
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,001
-It's nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

188
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,670
You don't seem surprised.

189
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,505
I'm Handa. It's nice to meet you.

190
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,799
-I'm Riko Nagai. Nice to meet you.
-Nagai?

191
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,967
-Yes, Nagai.
-Nice to meet you.

192
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,971
-She's in pageants.
-You are?

193
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,640
-Yes.
-Pageant competitor.

194
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,393
I won the grand prize
for high school girls.

195
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,896
Amazing. She seems like that type.

196
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,439
Out of the whole country!

197
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:51,569
That's amazing.
What are your plans for the future?

198
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,112
I'm not really sure what'll happen,

199
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,740
so I'm going to look for a part-time job
in the meantime.

200
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,327
Does your school have a branch here?

201
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,245
-No.
-You're going to commute?

202
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,749
-I'm going to commute.
-On the bullet train? Every time?

203
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,418
Well, I have to go about twice a month.

204
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,588
Oh, that's it?

205
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,424
Your mom's okay with this?

206
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:19,012
She is, but she's very worried.

207
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,806
Are you hungry at all?

208
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,141
-I am.
-You are?

209
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,269
Well, I actually brought home
some chashu pork.

210
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,438
I'll go heat some up.

211
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,483
-With sauce? Is there rice?
-There's no rice.

212
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,819
He's tired from work, too.

213
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,613
-He's impressive.
-I wonder if he has a lot.

214
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,114
He's so sweet.

215
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,366
-He's a nice guy.
-He is a nice guy.

216
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,911
If you need advice about relationships,
Hansan might be good to turn to.

217
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,913
I think he'd be good.

218
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:48,709
Or you're welcome
to come talk to me anytime.

219
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,089
-Was there any?
-All done?

220
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,216
Onions are so pungent.

221
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,927
I had trouble getting rid of the bite.

222
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,429
Oh, wow!

223
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,306
My apologies for serving chashu
so late at night.

224
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,808
Bon appétit!

225
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,646
-It's from your dad?
-My uncle runs a ramen shop in Nagano.

226
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,188
You were way off.

227
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,482
-He sometimes sends me things.
-Wow.

228
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,027
It comes frozen.
It's homemade.

229
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,737
It's so good!

230
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,073
We'll have to have a welcome party.

231
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,618
-We should go see the cherry blossoms.
-Nice!

232
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,913
-Let's go see cherry blossoms.
-Maybe cherry blossoms and a barbecue.

233
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,248
-It sounds fun.
-What day works best?

234
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,459
I'm actually leaving for Okinawa tomorrow.

235
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:36,256
-So you won't see me for a while.
-Until when?

236
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,216
I'm coming back on the second.

237
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,552
-The second?
-So, four days.

238
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,762
I'm coming back on the third.

239
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,682
-So sometime after the fourth?
-Yeah.

240
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,018
-Are you leaving early tomorrow?
-At what time are you leaving, Natsumi?

241
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,855
-I'm thinking of leaving by 7:00 a.m.
-I've got to leave by 8:00 a.m.

242
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,482
I'm free tomorrow.
Do you want to go shopping together?

243
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,484
-Yes, please.
-Let's go then.

244
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:59,655
-You're acting like a big sister.
-Yeah?

245
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,532
I am 23 after all.

246
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,913
-She's so cute!
-A high schooler.

247
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,875
She's still a kid and really cute.

248
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,878
The way she talks still sounds young.

249
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,923
-The number one high school girl in Japan.
-Right?

250
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:22,219
She's so flighty and only 18.

251
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:27,307
I wonder what kind of conversations
they'll have.

252
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,061
You know?
I'm sure she'll get used to it, but...

253
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:36,274
Even in terms of relationships,
to an 18-year-old, 27 is so much older.

254
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,235
-So much more adult.
-Definitely.

255
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:44,157
But there were girls in high school
who dated guys in their late twenties.

256
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,077
-The popular girls in class.
-Yes, those girls.

257
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,495
Teens though?

258
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,790
If it were me,
and maybe it's just my age,

259
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:55,168
she'd be too cute to go for.

260
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,797
Even if you wanted to.

261
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:05,220
I'd be all over Misaki,
but she's easy to go for.

262
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,684
It's hard to imagine
how they're going to interact.

263
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:16,565
She just arrived, said she was hungry,
and was served only chashu.

264
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,692
It's more like an appetizer.

265
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,695
And Hansan were like,
"Sorry to serve you this so late."

266
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,990
But those who thoughtlessly didn't serve
any food should be sorry.

267
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,411
In the history of <i>Terrace House,</i>

268
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,664
this group might be
the least skillful at cooking.

269
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,290
-You may be right.
-That's true.

270
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,920
-Nacchan's really the only one who can.
-That's true.

271
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,464
Both Hikaru and Arman can't,
Handa does chashu...

272
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,386
Misaki's a bit of an airhead
and Riko's 18.

273
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,764
Starvation might be a possibility.

274
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:53,977
-Rikopin's gonna start wasting away.
-Poor thing.

275
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,280
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

276
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,075
-Were you able to sleep?
-Yeah.

277
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,286
I slept pretty well.

278
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,955
Thank you for washing the dishes.

279
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,208
-Oh, these are the ones I used.
-Oh, they're yours?

280
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,835
We're down to four today.

281
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,545
-Hansan's gone too.
-Two people are out.

282
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,630
I'm off to Okinawa -Han
I'll be in Osaka! -Natsumi

283
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,007
-Do you have any makeup on?
-No.

284
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,801
Your skin is so nice.

285
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,970
I'm jealous.

286
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,222
What do you need to get?

287
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,683
Some hangers and...

288
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,477
a box?

289
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,771
-Oh, to put stuff in?
-Yes, a box to store things.

290
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,857
House slippers?

291
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,901
Oh, yes. I want some.

292
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,363
DAIKAN-YAMA, TOKYO

293
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,782
-Is this your first time in Daikan-yama?
-It is.

294
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,661
It's so stylish.

295
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,581
That ice cream shop is delicious.

296
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,249
Or so I heard.

297
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,334
You heard? You haven't had it?

298
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,088
-Here we are.
-It's so cute.

299
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,173
It's hard to believe everything's 300 yen.

300
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,053
It's so cute!

301
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,307
2013 ENROLLED IN
KARIYA HIGASHI HIGH SCHOOL

302
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,352
2014 SWITCHED TO ONLINE COURSES
2016 WON NATIONAL BEAUTY PAGEANT

303
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,648
-This one's more shallow.
-Yeah, I'll use this for underwear.

304
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:21,982
SINGLE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS

305
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,484
Here are some hangers!

306
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,279
-There are so many kinds.
-Yeah, it's so cute!

307
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,703
Is there anyone you like?

308
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:37,623
-There is.
-You're so lucky!

309
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,793
-Who do you think it is?
-One of the members?

310
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,877
Yeah.

311
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,591
-Who can it be? Hikaru?
-Yeah, I get so nervous around him.

312
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,720
Really? That's love.

313
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,808
What are you like when you're in love?

314
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,644
If it's one-sided...

315
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,479
I'm shy and hesitant.

316
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:03,315
That's normal.

317
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,442
-Is that how you are now?
-Yeah.

318
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,780
I'm probably not feminine enough.

319
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,951
-Really?
-Have you seen my pajamas?

320
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,453
They're sweats.

321
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:20,999
-Will you come with me to buy some?
-Let's go.

322
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,294
I need to start showing my feminine side.

323
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,922
Maybe in a subtle way.

324
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:31,384
If you show small glimpses
of femininity...

325
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,720
That's true.

326
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,513
I'm learning a lot.

327
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,434
SHIBUYA, TOKYO

328
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,485
Let's look at loungewear.

329
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,488
-Oh, something like this.
-That's pretty sexy.

330
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,284
-Would you wear something like this?
-No, never.

331
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,787
-It would look good.
-What do you think works for me?

332
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,789
Something mature...

333
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,709
and sexy.

334
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,503
Mature and sexy?

335
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,471
That's a cute set.

336
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,598
My sweats.

337
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,057
I like wearing them.

338
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,478
Have you gotten used to things?
I guess it's still early.

339
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,480
A little bit.

340
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:28,400
-Is Misaki easy to talk to?
-She is.

341
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,196
-Are those rabbits?
-They're rabbits.

342
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,240
Why'd you pick those?
'Cause they're cute?

343
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,576
I got them 'cause they're cute.

344
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,878
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

345
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,462
What's with that outfit?

346
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,090
Isn't it nice?

347
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,969
What's going on?

348
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,721
What do you mean?

349
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,932
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

350
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,643
No, what's going on?

351
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,188
No, something's up.
You're usually dressed pretty lamely.

352
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,355
Am I?

353
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,526
Don't try to act slick
and cross your legs.

354
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,110
What's going on?

355
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,822
I mean, it's cute.
It looks good.

356
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,198
Seriously?

357
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,991
-You're just saying that.
-I'm telling the truth.

358
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,243
-For real?
-Yeah.

359
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,961
Why are you acting sexy?
It's not even sexy.

360
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,590
You're so mean!

361
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,592
I'm just kidding.
You look sexy.

362
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,135
But why? What's going on?

363
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,304
-It's really hot right?
-That's right, it's hot.

364
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,976
-Why are you laughing?
-Oh, man.

365
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,686
Why are you laughing?

366
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,063
-It's hot, isn't it?
-Yeah.

367
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:53,861
Did I ever say you weren't sexy?
Is that why you're dressed like that?

368
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,698
I can't look in that direction.

369
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,200
-Why not?
-Because I can't.

370
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:04,287
I can almost see your butt!

371
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,794
-Then don't look.
-You don't have to cross your legs.

372
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,088
Fine, like this then?

373
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,300
Why are you looking all over the place?

374
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,347
-You're going to sleep?
-I am.

375
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,643
-Good night.
-Good night.

376
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,895
-Good night.
-Good night.

377
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,234
How do you think it went?

378
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:42,200
Should I have taken my top off?
It was embarrassing.

379
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,952
I'm sure.

380
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,831
-It's hard to have it seem natural.
-Yeah.

381
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,708
That was the best I could do.

382
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,670
-Showing your shoulders?
-Yeah.

383
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,880
But he said it was cute.

384
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:58,008
But he was like, "What's going on?"
at first.

385
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,095
That's because
it was embarrassing for him too.

386
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,350
So he was just saying that,
even though he thinks it's cute.

387
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,727
Did he?

388
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:12,731
I couldn't pull it off at all.
It was so bad.

389
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,152
EBISU, TOKYO

390
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,575
So Misaki is just so-so?

391
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:26,203
She's still, well...

392
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,665
I like her, but...

393
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,084
Did yesterday's outfit change things?

394
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,629
That kind of thing isn't going
to change my mind or anything.

395
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:39,049
But some things are holding me back.

396
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,926
Like what? The way she acts?

397
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,470
She seems emotionally unstable.

398
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,639
Like how she cries easily?

399
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:48,391
-Or she seems insecure.
-In general you mean?

400
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,814
I don't know how she feels,
whether she likes me or not, but...

401
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,399
-But you're going out again, right?
-Yeah.

402
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,068
Yeah, I'll give it another shot.

403
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,529
See how it goes.

404
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,698
Does she try to show how she feels?

405
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,117
I don't know. Not really.

406
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,328
I don't know.
This is tasty.

407
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,373
Oh, Nacchan.

408
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,584
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

409
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,418
-Did you tan?
-No.

410
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:18,005
-Are you tired?
-Welcome back.

411
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,465
How were things?
Did anything happen?

412
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,677
I thought I'd work on my feminine side.

413
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,932
I thought I'd start with my pajamas
since I'm always in sweats.

414
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,518
So I went to buy some.

415
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:34,563
I'll show you later,
but it's pretty revealing.

416
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,940
And I showed Hikaru.

417
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,777
It was extremely awkward.

418
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,820
-So you did it already?
-Yes.

419
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:45,115
And did he make a move?

420
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,700
No.

421
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,578
Didn't you say you guys were going out?

422
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:53,999
Yeah, this month,
but I haven't come up with a place yet.

423
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,837
SANGENJAYA, TOKYO

424
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,805
-Hey.
-Hi.

425
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,765
AKANE SAKANOUE
MISAKI'S FRIEND, ACTRESS

426
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,727
-It's been awhile since I've seen you.
-Have you been watching Netflix?

427
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,146
I've seen up until episode 25.

428
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:21,068
What do you think from what you've seen?
What do you think of Hikaru?

429
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,236
-He's a little scary.
-Scary?

430
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,656
A little thuggish.

431
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,200
Like how he reacted
when I said he looks like a bad driver?

432
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,077
Yeah, he was scary!

433
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,331
-He was scary?
-Yeah, scary.

434
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,250
I suggested going to the hot springs,

435
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:42,297
but he said he didn't want to.

436
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,966
He said he didn't want to go in with me.

437
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:47,970
And when Nacchan said,
"But isn't it okay with a girl you like?"

438
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,805
He said he didn't like me.

439
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,265
-About you?
-Yeah, that's what he said.

440
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,729
Even when we're all together,
if I say something,

441
00:23:56,831 --> 00:23:58,939
he'll say, "That makes no sense".

442
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,691
He'll say stuff like that.

443
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,235
He's really blunt.

444
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,655
His phrasing can be pretty harsh.

445
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,658
He's especially harsh with me.

446
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:11,660
Especially?

447
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:13,579
Like, "What? That's gross."

448
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,624
Or, "You can't be serious."

449
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,334
Doesn't that annoy you?

450
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,044
No, it doesn't.

451
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:29,094
Listening to you so far,
all I hear are bad things.

452
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,639
-About Hikaru?
-Yeah.

453
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,933
So what do you like about him?

454
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,269
-About Hikaru?
-Yeah.

455
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,897
It really makes me wonder.

456
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,733
What do I like about him?

457
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,152
I'm not sure.

458
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:48,614
But I don't think you need a reason.

459
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:53,160
-I just like him.
-You always say that.

460
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,081
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

461
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,836
-Doing well?
-Yeah.

462
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,714
-Are you?
-Yeah, I'm doing well.

463
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,179
Those are cute.

464
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,016
-The rabbits. Did you buy them?
-I did.

465
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,477
Are you used to things now?

466
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:22,230
-Yeah.
-That was quick.

467
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,857
That's good.

468
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,618
-Do I scare you?
-No.

469
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:35,703
-You sure?
-Yeah.

470
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,454
-I thought I scared you.
-No.

471
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,540
-You're okay?
-Yeah.

472
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,543
I'm not a bad person.

473
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,506
Are you getting along
with the other girls?

474
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,716
Yeah.

475
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,510
-With Misaki?
-Yeah.

476
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:54,346
-That's good.
-She's been really nice to me.

477
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,931
That's good.

478
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,693
-Do you like the ocean?
-I like the ocean.

479
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,237
Have you been to the ones near here?
Like Shonan?

480
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,365
-I've been to Enoshima.
-Oh, you have?

481
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,659
If you have time...

482
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:18,495
-we should go.
-I'd like to.

483
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,998
-There's a place I always go to.
-Is it far?

484
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,792
It's about an hour by car.

485
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,837
I work part-time in Kamakura.

486
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,547
I see.

487
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:30,758
-I wanna go.
-Let's go.

488
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,594
I haven't been lately.

489
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,305
-You need to go soon then.
-Yeah.

490
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,766
I need to refresh.

491
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:47,065
Tamosan's approach was interesting.

492
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,901
That was lingerie, wasn't it?

493
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:53,864
Not many people would wear lingerie
in the living room of a shared house.

494
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,242
-You normally wouldn't, right?
-It's a turn off, isn't it?

495
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,913
It's fine if it's for fun.

496
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:05,250
If she had just gotten out of the bath
and was on her way back to her room...

497
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,335
If he happened to see her...

498
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,213
Then it's like, "Wait, what?"

499
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,257
You shouldn't purposely show it.

500
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,051
She came downstairs just for that.

501
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,345
She came downstairs
and showed her shoulders.

502
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,974
That's Midori Satsuki's move.

503
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,268
MIDORI SATSUKI

504
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,980
If you're in control of your sexiness
like Ms. Satsuki...

505
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:30,358
Only she could pull off
something like that.

506
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:34,154
Now that Riko is here,

507
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,616
Misaki's acting like a big sister.

508
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,994
Somehow redeeming her?

509
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,287
I doubt it.

510
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,750
Emotionally, I think
Rikopin and Misaki are the same age.

511
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,002
Misaki might even be slightly younger.

512
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,088
Riko seems more responsible.

513
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,424
The conversation between her and Arman
was going nowhere.

514
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,845
It must be a recording or something.

515
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:00,806
"Have you been to the ocean?"
"Yes, I've been to the ocean."

516
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,769
-I think it'll be a disaster at the ocean.
-Everyone should go together.

517
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,106
It'll be tough with just the two of them.
It'll be like, "This is wave."

518
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:13,360
I'm looking forward to
Tamosan's sad attempts.

519
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,113
-I'm sure there will be a lot of failures.
-Poor Tamosan.

520
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,115
She's gonna try
to make eating vegetables sexy.

521
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,288
Like a zucchini.

522
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,041
You can't go there.

523
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:33,506
-A cucumber's okay. But a zucchini?
-I'm sorry.

524
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,090
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,259
-That's too far.
-I'm sorry.

526
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:44,016
NAKAMEGURO, TOKYO

527
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,066
The cherry blossoms are so pretty.

528
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,069
-Are there cherry blossoms in Hawaii?
-There aren't.

529
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,362
There aren't?

530
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,866
Then it's been a while
since you've seen them.

531
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,910
Yeah, it's been ten years.

532
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,039
-It's nice.
-Isn't it?

533
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,541
I'm glad I got to see them.

534
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,001
Are you used to things?

535
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,670
A little.

536
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:14,963
Who scares you the most?

537
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,757
No one's scary.

538
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,509
No one's scary.

539
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:24,932
Welcome to <i>Terrace House.</i>

540
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,518
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

541
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,607
-Wow.
-Yeah.

542
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:39,780
I'm changing the subject.
What do men find attractive in women?

543
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,867
What do we find attractive?

544
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,578
I wonder.

545
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,665
What about loungewear?

546
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:50,874
Loungewear?

547
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,168
-Loungewear?
-Loungewear.

548
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:57,464
Because that's something
only boyfriends usually get to see.

549
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:03,554
<i>Terrace House</i> is an unusual case.
You get to see girls in their loungewear.

550
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,014
-No?
-Me? No.

551
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:11,645
I've got one.
When girls wear only a white button-down.

552
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:13,355
Only that?

553
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,608
I totally get it, Arman.

554
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:18,318
But who does that?

555
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,737
That's nice, but...

556
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,824
Even if you did,
you probably wouldn't at <i>Terrace House.</i>

557
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,659
Because everyone else is here.

558
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:28,411
-But it's okay to do it, isn't it?
-Sure, you could.

559
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,497
If there's someone you want to show it to.

560
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,374
Someone you want to show it to?

561
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,377
You can't do it intentionally.

562
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,546
-You had to have always done it.
-Yeah.

563
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,715
It's better if it's natural.

564
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,384
Let's not talk about loungewear anymore.

565
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,390
-What's wrong?
-Was that at me?

566
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,850
Ask them over there.

567
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:53,186
What kind of loungewear
do you like, Hikaru?

568
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,147
-The sexy kind?
-Yeah.

569
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,774
I do.

570
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,652
Nacchan can be a little mean sometimes.

571
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:03,113
-How come?
-You say things you don't need to say.

572
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,033
I don't understand.
I'm scared.

573
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,951
What do you mean? Like what?

574
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,953
Don't worry about it.

575
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,085
That's gonna fester later.

576
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,880
You didn't have to bring up loungewear.

577
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:24,426
I wasn't talking about you.
I just wanted to hear about Hikaru.

578
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,098
Something's up.
