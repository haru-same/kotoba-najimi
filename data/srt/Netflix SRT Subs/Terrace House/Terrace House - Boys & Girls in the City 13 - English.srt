1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,934
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,519
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,438
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,066
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,027
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,863
Let's go over what happened last week.

8
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,701
-Let's get to it. I know she's itching to.
-I am.

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,245
Tatsuya told Minori how he feels.

10
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,872
{\an8}I really like you Minori.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,958
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,877
{\an8}I want you by my side.

13
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,546
{\an8}It's moving a little fast for me.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,007
{\an8}I want to be surer of my feelings,

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,303
{\an8}so I feel like I can't give you
an answer until then.

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,808
-I thought she'd say yes for sure.
-She asked him to wait.

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:03,814
She wants Tatsuya to step out
of his comfort zone and make a move.

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,610
-And we have a new member, Arman.
-That's right.

19
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,737
{\an8}He had a job interview
and joined a boxing gym.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,821
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD

21
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,784
{\an8}DAIKI MIYAGI, 25 YEARS OLD,
ACTOR, TARGET SHIBUYA OWNER

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>Arman is rather...</i>

23
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,582
Well, he's made a good impression
on the ladies.

24
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,416
-He seems to have no faults.
-For now at least.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,503
Him and Mizuki have something going.

26
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,213
-Yes!
-Their date in Kamakura.

27
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,757
{\an8}Wow.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,842
{\an8}It's like old Japan.

29
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,261
{\an8}Will you try this one, too?

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,179
{\an8}-That's cute. Maybe too cute.
-It is.

31
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,640
{\an8}It's freezing!

32
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,433
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD
MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,394
{\an8}It feels good!

34
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,023
{\an8}Mizuki turned into a whole new person.
Her voice changed.

35
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,526
The tone of her voice is higher.

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,657
Arman invited her to his match.
December 13th.

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,825
-I wonder what'll happen.
-A confession of love maybe?

38
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,495
<i>Terrace House</i> is known
for the ringside kiss scene.

39
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,667
{\an8}-That's true.
-Yes, for sure.

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,255
{\an8}And Yuriko told her ex-boyfriend
how she feels.

41
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,051
{\an8}Last time, I told you how I felt.

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,389
{\an8}I told you then
that I couldn't forget you.

43
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,143
{\an8}I'd just like to know
your honest feelings.

44
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,270
{\an8}TADAMICHI KAWANO, 25 YEARS OLD
YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD

45
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,774
{\an8}The episode ended
before we could find out his answer.

46
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,568
But his expression...

47
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:36,699
He's being forced into marriage
with his boss's daughter.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,326
Yuriko said she wants
to get back together,

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,411
but he can't say yes

50
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,331
because the boss's daughter
is right there waiting for him

51
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,500
-in her red convertible.
-That reason, right?

52
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,378
The sound of an engine right now
would get a reaction out of us, huh?

53
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,719
{\an8}I'd just like to know
your honest feelings.

54
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,313
I'm surprised to hear
you're leaving <i>Terrace House.</i>

55
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,444
But getting back together...

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,658
isn't an option.

57
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,248
The reason...

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,296
is the same as before,
when we first agreed to break up.

59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,468
The situation hasn't gotten any better.
I'm even busier than before.

60
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,054
-Now?
-So even if we get back together,

61
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,725
I don't think it'll make you happy.

62
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,438
There's something else I haven't told you.

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,154
I'm thinking of going back to my hometown.

64
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,993
I'm at a crossroads in my life...

65
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,042
and if I'm in a relationship,
I'd have to think about marriage.

66
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,754
I'm feeling very limited in my options.

67
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,301
These are my honest thoughts.

68
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:27,184
I don't plan for us to get back together.

69
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,147
I understand.

70
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,942
I'm not a student anymore.

71
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,654
I understand.

72
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,578
I'm gonna go now.

73
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,958
Thank you.

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,043
Good luck on your exams.

75
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,969
See you later.

76
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,643
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD,
ASPIRING FIREFIGHTER

77
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,562
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

82
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,462
{\an8}It's Yuriko's last day,
so let's give her a nice send off. Cheers!

83
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,964
Cheers!

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,553
-Bon appétit!
-Tasty!

85
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
-Hot pot was a good idea.
-Delicious!

86
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,475
-How was your interview, Arman?
-I haven't heard a response yet.

87
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,105
I passed the first interview,
and I went in for a second.

88
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,523
How do you feel about it?

89
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,609
-I'm not sure.
-You're not sure?

90
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,237
Did you tell everyone about your match?

91
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,698
Did I tell you?

92
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,076
-I told everyone.
-Yeah. So, yeah.

93
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,371
-Yeah, we heard.
-December 13th, is it?

94
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,750
-That's only a month away.
-Yeah, only a month.

95
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,170
We can witness you being cool.

96
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,505
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

97
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,508
-Oh!
-So? The result?

98
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,969
-The result?
-What happened?

99
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,637
-You announced it already?
-No, not yet.

100
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,599
We've been waiting to hear.

101
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,808
I...

102
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,893
was rejected today.

103
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,355
-For real?
-Seriously?

104
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,567
It was almost refreshing
how clearly he said no.

105
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,404
It's his loss for turning down
such a cute girl.

106
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,074
Arman, thank you!

107
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,410
-Did he say anything?
-Give you a reason?

108
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:38,375
After he said no,
I was in shock for the next few minutes.

109
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,793
I think he gave an explanation.

110
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,963
-But you don't remember?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,466
He said getting back together
was not an option.

112
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,218
Wow.

113
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,596
I think it was better than
if he tried to word it nicely.

114
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,265
Do you feel like you got closure?

115
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,892
-Yeah, I do.
-That's good.

116
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,270
What are you going to do now?

117
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:04,276
Well, in December, there's
a big national exam for med students.

118
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,654
-So you're going to focus on that?
-That's my plan.

119
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,989
That's good.

120
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,241
That's a big portion.

121
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,744
I think I deserve it.

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,622
-Eat, eat!
-Yeah, let me eat.

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,593
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

124
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,138
-That's a lot of luggage.
-Looks heavy.

125
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,183
But you got everything into two bags.

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,227
Yeah, barely.

127
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,729
Minori helped me last night.

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,943
Phew! Thank you for everything,
the last three months.

129
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,446
Thank you.

130
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,867
-Thank you for the last ten days.
-Thank you.

131
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,369
I guess I'll be going.

132
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,290
I'm going.

133
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,336
-Your key?
-Yeah, my key.

134
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,386
Bye!

135
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,306
-See you!
-Bye!

136
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,111
-Oh, man.
-Wow.

137
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,279
He completely cut her down.

138
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,157
It's so sad.

139
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,034
-It's Sad Triendl.
-Sad Triendl?

140
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,162
I'm a little shocked.

141
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:43,166
-"Not an option."
-They were strong words.

142
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,628
Strongly worded rejection
can garner criticism,

143
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,091
but vague rejection is similarly bad,
if not worse.

144
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,717
I don't get it.

145
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,137
Very true!

146
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,638
That might have been the best way.

147
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,643
But he said
he's going back to his hometown?

148
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,772
Does that mean he's opening a clinic?

149
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,775
Maybe he's actually
the son of a hospital director.

150
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,282
So, the boss's daughter scenario
never existed?

151
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,326
The reason being
that he was the boss's son.

152
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,622
What's going to happen now
that another person has left?

153
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,375
But there are relationships developing.

154
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,753
-That's true.
-Mizuki and Arman.

155
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,798
And we'll have to see what happens
between Minori and Uchihara.

156
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,508
It's the last spurt.

157
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,803
{\an8}Did you have dinner, Yuki?

158
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,973
{\an8}Not really.

159
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,725
-Wanna go eat later?
-Later?

160
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,103
-He said he wanted to go to Fuji Soba.
-I was thinking that, too.

161
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,772
-Tonight?
-Yeah, did you eat?

162
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,816
I ate already.

163
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,609
-Wanna eat again?
-No.

164
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,322
We went with Arman before.

165
00:10:55,405 --> 00:11:00,368
He was saying he had too much to drink,
and that he wanted something with broth.

166
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,455
So we went to Fuji Soba,
but he ordered a Ten Don.

167
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,708
He didn't order something
with broth at all!

168
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,960
What I really wanted was tempura soba.

169
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,421
So when I saw "Ten" on the menu,
I just ordered it.

170
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,425
-Oh, you thought you were getting Tensoba?
-Yeah, but they put rice in front of me.

171
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,968
I only ate half of it.

172
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,263
It was disappointing.

173
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,434
Can I get the door?

174
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,187
-Yeah. Should I get Mizuki?
-I'll go, too.

175
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,441
Maybe it's Mizuki.

176
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,109
Wait, here she is.

177
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,614
What's going on?

178
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,865
Should I open it?

179
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,659
-I wanna open it!
-Wait, me too!

180
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,996
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Good evening.

181
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,250
{\an8}-Let's invite her in.
-Come in!

182
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,170
This moment is always nerve-racking.

183
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,590
Good evening.

184
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,925
Hey!

185
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,430
{\an8}-Good evening!
-This is the turnout?

186
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,557
{\an8}KURUMI NAKADA, 23 YEARS OLD,
MODEL, MINORI'S OLDER SISTER

187
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,352
-Oh, don't do that!
-What?

188
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,020
I wasn't expecting this.

189
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,773
What?
You thought I was the new member?

190
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,275
We totally did!

191
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,527
-Here's a little something.
-Thank you.

192
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,530
Oh, Makocchan isn't here.

193
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,573
Weird!

194
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:25,912
This is for anyone who drinks.
And some cookies.

195
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,458
-Thank you.
-Because, you know, wine and sweets.

196
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,752
High-quality selection. Wow.

197
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,297
I just saw the episode that aired.
It was so sad!

198
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,676
Yesterday,
after we all watched it together,

199
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,470
she called and said, "Poor Tap."

200
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,514
Yeah, Yuriko was horrible!

201
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,433
-We didn't say that!
-But she was!

202
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,517
Why?

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,269
That's not just being oblivious.
That's being horrible.

204
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,523
-It's not horrible.
-Just oblivious.

205
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,525
That's just a cover.

206
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,861
-She represents the voice of the viewers.
-It's refreshing.

207
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,407
Minori says you always give your opinion.

208
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,494
-You wanted to complain, right?
-Oh, yeah, when Tap was lecturing Mizuki.

209
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:11,666
They talked about that a lot
and said how annoying that was.

210
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,544
I was like,
we don't all have the same priorities.

211
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,298
-Don't tell us that.
-I get tons of comments about that.

212
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,884
And you,
from a viewer's point of view,

213
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,637
-it's what we want to know the most.
-What do you mean?

214
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,683
-What was it like after?
-That's what you're wondering?

215
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,977
-Oh, you haven't heard?
-I haven't told her.

216
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,107
She wanted to watch it.
I saw her before we went to Odaiba.

217
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,736
She told me you guys were going on a date.

218
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,571
She was expecting your confession of love.

219
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,908
She knew what was coming!

220
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,621
Hey, that's unfair!

221
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,205
-Yeah, Uchi...
-So, you don't know what happened?

222
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,125
-I don't know.
-I've been put on hold.

223
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,005
Oh, yeah, she did tell me that.
So I asked her if she's making you wait.

224
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,883
Yes, that's how it is.

225
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,802
I'll be more expressive.

226
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,303
I like Uchi.

227
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,891
You've never pursued a guy, have you?

228
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,059
-No.
-Right?

229
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,686
-Never?
-Yeah.

230
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,522
Make her work for you.

231
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,690
Actually, I haven't pursued
anyone before either.

232
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,191
That's why it's taking so long.

233
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,073
-Excuse me.
-Please come in.

234
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,118
-Oh, it's really spacious.
-Yeah.

235
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,622
Minori and her sister's personalities
are nothing alike.

236
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,583
She's strong.

237
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,460
-The strong big sister.
-Yeah, she's straightforward.

238
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,588
-So, how's Uchi?
-We're going there?

239
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:46,010
-Of course.
-So you want him to be more expressive?

240
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,345
Not expressive, per se.

241
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,264
Like, embracing you
because he can't hold back anymore?

242
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,560
-Yeah, that'd be...
-That's totally what you want!

243
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,062
Wouldn't that make you happy?

244
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,816
I was totally going to ask him,
"Why don't you just hold her from behind?"

245
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,026
That seems completely unlikely.

246
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,362
So you're afraid
his feelings aren't at that level?

247
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,615
Yes, that's exactly it!

248
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,536
You won't believe his feelings are sincere
until he reaches that level.

249
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,706
-Amazing.
-Maybe he's never done that though.

250
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,375
-So maybe he just doesn't know?
-Even if he doesn't...

251
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,046
Even if he doesn't,
you don't mind going out with him, right?

252
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,257
Well, that came out wrong.
But if he pushes for it,

253
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,427
you're thinking you wouldn't mind, right?

254
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,763
I want to go out with him
with the best feelings.

255
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,934
-"Best feelings"?
-Like, you love him?

256
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,978
Why don't you put yourself
in that mindset?

257
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,104
I am.

258
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,608
Why don't you make him lunch every day?

259
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,779
No comment.

260
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,906
You can write "Still?"
with nori on his rice ball.

261
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,034
A noriben?

262
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,497
-I hope it works out for you.
-I'll try my best.

263
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
-You too, Mizuki.
-Yes, me too.

264
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,003
I do like Arman for now.

265
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,131
Her sister should just stay over.

266
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,883
They have an open bed.

267
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,011
-It's an amazing house.
-Is it?

268
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,930
-Was it messy?
-Super messy.

269
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,516
It shows people have really settled here.

270
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,808
Can I show her the playroom?

271
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,393
-Yeah, of course. Right?
-Of course.

272
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,520
She wants to see it.

273
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:22,064
-Maybe I'll have Uchi show me.
-Oh, really?

274
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,610
Surprised?

275
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,820
-We've got nothing to hide.
-Nothing to hide?

276
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,949
-The playroom is totally clean.
-He's very confident.

277
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,868
Are they gonna be okay?

278
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,540
-And here is the playroom.
-The playroom.

279
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,585
-It's surprisingly clean.
-Right?

280
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,547
Yeah, but there's a ton of dust.

281
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:50,968
Here are Minori's glasses.
She likes to leave them everywhere.

282
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,640
-Her glasses represent her lifestyle.
-How is she?

283
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,310
-Minori, um...
-I came to ask about that.

284
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,394
I see, well...

285
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,896
-You really like her?
-I do.

286
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,480
-Really?
-Yes.

287
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,734
Watching you,
I know you went on that date to Chichibu,

288
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,697
but I don't think you like her
as much as Minori is hoping.

289
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,074
Am I not coming on strong enough?

290
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,910
She's the person I love most in the world.

291
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,745
-You said that?
-No.

292
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,916
-My feelings aren't coming across.
-You should just say that.

293
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,252
But I'd rather prove myself
through action rather than words.

294
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,504
-Such as?
-Such as?

295
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,715
Such as...

296
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,260
Well, you know.
I think what she wants from you is...

297
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:37,849
that feeling of,
"I can't restrain myself around you."

298
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,309
-Minori?
-Yes, I think so.

299
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,815
So seeing her sleeping face
doesn't make you want to kiss her?

300
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,902
Seeing her sleeping face
does make me want to kiss her.

301
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,528
I do.

302
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,032
I do, but I can't bring myself to do it.

303
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,201
But if you do something like that,

304
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,162
it'll make everyone think,
"Wow, you like her that much."

305
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:04,166
I'll try my best.
That was good advice.

306
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,920
-Next time...
-I'm looking forward to it.

307
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:13,300
-I hope you'll be her boyfriend.
-Thank you, Kurumi.

308
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,803
I can't wait.

309
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,431
{\an8}DAIKAN-YAMA, TOKYO

310
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,685
I'm trying to decide on the label.

311
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,353
Which one do you like?

312
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,232
-If you had to pick.
-This one.

313
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,069
You like this one?
You're right.

314
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:40,494
Actually, I'm going to <i>Terrace House.</i>

315
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,333
-You don't have a boyfriend?
-Not for two years now.

316
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:52,840
Finding love would be nice,
but it would also be nice to make friends.

317
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,092
I'm very nervous.

318
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,970
And worried.

319
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,933
-She looks pretty.
-She looks beautiful.

320
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,268
Beautiful!

321
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,812
Really clear skin.

322
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,480
Yes, she looks like
she takes care of herself.

323
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,982
She seems like your type.

324
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,527
What do you think of that, Tokui?

325
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,030
I was just thinking she seems my type.

326
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,491
The sister is so cool!

327
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,205
She's like an action star.

328
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:25,915
So true.

329
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,253
-Really blunt.
-"So? Why don't you just say that?"

330
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,464
So cool!

331
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,592
The sister really gave a big push.

332
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:41,180
-It was probably really good for Minori.
-It really was.

333
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,101
She basically told them both
to make a move if they like each other.

334
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,855
Her words really reached Tatsuya.

335
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,943
That he should convey to her
that she is his only love in the world.

336
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,320
Wasn't that a little creepy?

337
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,657
He's giggling.

338
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,202
It's making me all itchy.

339
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,580
I think I'm allergic.

340
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,084
I think that Uchi,
when he gave that head massage,

341
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,881
{\an8}he already feels like
he reached second base.

342
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,385
{\an8}But it means nothing for the girl.

343
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,178
And we've got a new member coming.

344
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,181
This is probably
the last chance for Yuki.

345
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,020
-The next one's coming in.
-We'll get to see the full face soon.

346
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,313
I hope she has tiny eyes.

347
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,858
That'd be hilarious!

348
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,401
Or super wide-set eyes.

349
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,195
She won't look like that.

350
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,741
-What if her eyes are at her temples?
-Stop making fun.

351
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,243
She's about to make an appearance.

352
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,913
Who has eyes up at their temples?

353
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,041
When someone stands in front of her,

354
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,876
she'll be like,
"I'm sorry, I can't see you."

355
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,587
Even when dining together, she'll turn.

356
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,761
-"This is delicious."
-When did she turn into a fish?

357
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:03,846
Nobody like that exists!

358
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,932
But she'll see if you talk to her
from this angle.

359
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,309
There's no one like that!

360
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,274
{\an8}I wonder
what your sister and Uchi talked about.

361
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,358
Hopefully something good.

362
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,277
Probably exactly what she said
in our room.

363
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,987
That's true.

364
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:24,158
-She has no qualms.
-That's what's so great.

365
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,742
She's just happy if she's entertained.

366
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,287
She's probably thinking
it doesn't affect her.

367
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,248
Is Arman home in the afternoons?

368
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,919
-I wonder if he got the job.
-It's been a while, right?

369
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,798
Oh, Arman.

370
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,562
-Welcome back, Uchi.
-I'm home.

371
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,899
What are you guys doing?

372
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,400
-Nothing really.
-Working.

373
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,568
Working?

374
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,904
-Just Mizuki.
-Oh, yeah, just me.

375
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,076
-She's here!
-Why don't you get it, Yuki?

376
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,662
-I'm going to wait.
-She's here!

377
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,957
Yes?

378
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,959
<i>Hi, I'm the new roommate.</i>

379
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,586
-Oh, wow.
-She's peppy.

380
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,386
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

381
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,306
-Should we help with her luggage?
-Let's wait a bit.

382
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,893
-You can go.
-You're so nice.

383
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,853
I'm not trying to be nice.

384
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,651
-Hello.
-Hi.

385
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,821
-Wait, what?
-Hi.

386
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,868
-I've met Mizuki before.
-What?

387
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,829
-Through a friend of a friend.
-That's right!

388
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,957
Like a second cousin?

389
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,834
-It's nice to meet you.
-Wow.

390
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,421
I'm Arisa Ohata.

391
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,381
-Arisa?
-Arisa Ohata.

392
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,384
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Kagoshima.

393
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,510
The twang.

394
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,971
-Your accent.
-Yes, from Kagoshima.

395
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,307
-She's here, Arman.
-I'm new, too.

396
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,685
-It's nice to meet you.
-I'm Arman.

397
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,145
-I'm Arisa.
-Arisa?

398
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,813
Yes, Arisa Ohata.

399
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,274
What do you do?

400
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:25,112
I used to design clothes.

401
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,865
I'm now getting ready
to start my own hat brand.

402
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,996
-Your own brand?
-Yes, my own.

403
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,123
-Nice.
-That's amazing.

404
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,291
How old are you?

405
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,668
-I'm 25 years old.
-Same as you, Arman.

406
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,004
-The same?
-Yeah. 1990.

407
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,716
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Yes, that's important.

408
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,718
I don't have a boyfriend.

409
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,139
Why did you come to <i>Terrace House?</i>

410
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,977
{\an8}I've been in Tokyo for six years.

411
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,228
{\an8}ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD
HAT DESIGNER

412
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:02,316
I was so motivated in the beginning,
but lately, everyday...

413
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,944
has become repetitive.

414
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,992
If it continues like this,
there's no point of me staying in Tokyo.

415
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:16,788
I wanted to meet more people
from other fields, hardworking people,

416
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:21,085
and I wanted to remember
what that felt like.

417
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,006
Can I ask what's your type?

418
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,427
Someone who can survive
on a deserted island.

419
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,096
A deserted island?

420
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,680
-A deserted island?
-What do you mean?

421
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,308
Someone I can rely on.

422
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,435
Oh, if the two of you were
on a deserted island?

423
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,188
Yes, even if the environment changes...

424
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,649
-Someone you can rely on.
-...that person wouldn't.

425
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,902
-You can live together.
-Yes, and the place wouldn't matter.

426
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,989
Why don't you show her upstairs?
Do you need help with your luggage?

427
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,159
-Wanna go?
-Yes.

428
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,285
Please come in.

429
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,204
-Isn't it clean?
-It's always clean.

430
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,291
Wow, nice!
It's so clean.

431
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,625
It's spacious.

432
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,878
-Excuse me.
-Your bed's here, Arisa.

433
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,923
I'm so happy.

434
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,717
-I'll leave it to you guys.
-Bye.

435
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,470
-Thank you!
-See you later.

436
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,347
I should've dressed nicer.

437
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,852
You're worried about that?
Is she your type?

438
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,022
Not completely, but she's cute.

439
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,649
-She's cute?
-Yeah.

440
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,859
It's gonna be fun for you then.

441
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,737
If she can drink, she'll be perfect.

442
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,700
-What do you think, Yuki?
-She's really cute.

443
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,246
-She answered my question immediately.
-Which one?

444
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,290
What she came here for.

445
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,251
She said she wanted
to start her own brand.

446
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,589
-Yeah. That was appealing.
-It's a good day.

447
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,303
I don't know,
but I'm going to make it a good one.

448
00:25:55,137 --> 00:26:00,476
The fact that she tries to hide
her accent is great.

449
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,770
But yet the Kagoshima accent
still comes out.

450
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,272
I love it.

451
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,692
-You love it?
-You're so excited.

452
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:13,114
-That black hair... I love it!
-There it is. The black hair.

453
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,783
It's been awhile since I've felt this way.

454
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,577
That's so cute!

455
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,330
<i>Terrace House</i>
may have just pulled my fangs.

456
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,332
Darn it.

457
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,041
-This is a first.
-Yes, it is.

458
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,502
Since Season One.

459
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,379
I want to join the house.

460
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,880
I want to join <i>Terrace House</i> now!

461
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,591
I want to join!

462
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:39,306
Adachi doesn't stand a chance.

463
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,726
-No.
-Not at all?

464
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,353
He was trying to be cool again.

465
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,148
"She answered
when I asked about her dreams.

466
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,524
So she's all right."

467
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:56,323
-What's with that dream boss?
-I know.

468
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,242
Why is he so tough
on other people's dreams?

469
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:03,997
If they answered,
"Hmm, there's no specific reason."

470
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,082
Then it's an automatic rejection.

471
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,045
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

472
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:16,134
{\an8}I'm still unsettled.
Maybe because of the ceiling?

473
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,345
There's so much space.

474
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,765
I hope I can sleep.

475
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,143
You should take a long hot bath.

476
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,147
Arman and Yuki are probably drinking.

477
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,024
-They drink every night.
-Yeah.

478
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,444
-Together?
-Yeah.

479
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,447
-What do they drink?
-Pretty much beer.

480
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:41,159
Is anyone in love?

481
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,413
-Love? Are you looking for love?
-Yes.

482
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,748
Did anyone attract your attention?

483
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:51,127
Arman seemed easy to talk to.

484
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,132
He seems like he'd be able to survive
on a deserted island.

485
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,094
He's definitely that type.

486
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,014
I totally thought Arman
when you said that before.

487
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,309
Yeah.
