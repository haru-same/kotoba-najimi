1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,893
Hey!

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,938
-You scared me!
-It's only a matter of time until they...

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,355
When are you free?

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,819
Well, next Tuesday.

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,404
Wanna go to Mother Farm?

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,783
-Have you been to Mother Farm?
-I want to go.

7
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,201
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,620
Mother Farm sounds nice.

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,330
We'll be going there, thanks.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,582
Have fun.

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,083
Have fun!

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,212
-I--
-No way!

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,548
-No way.
-No way, a new member.

14
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,467
He's here!

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,639
-My heart's pounding.
-What are we gonna do?

16
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,057
Oh, man...

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,727
-He's here!
-I'm nervous!

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,519
I'm not going to look
until the last second.

19
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,313
He might be hot.

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,440
Let's see, let's see.

21
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,859
Hey.

22
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,656
I'm moving in today.

23
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,242
I'm Yamasato.

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,369
-Oh...
-Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,996
You can call me Ryota.

26
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:25,878
Torichan.

27
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,884
You haven't had much luck in love.
I've been watching.

28
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,512
-Yeah, so Torichan...
-Yes?

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,890
...really wants to find love.

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,184
So I came at a perfect time.

31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,855
-Excuse me.
-Sure. I'm Tokui.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,442
-I work at the aquarium.
-Oh, wow! That's great.

33
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,779
I'm working on becoming a firefighter.

34
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,657
-What?
-A firefighter.

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,408
-A firefighter?
-You're working on it?

36
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,076
I haven't passed the test yet.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,203
-How old are you?
-I'm 39.

38
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,539
-You're 39 and you're...
-Yes.

39
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,668
-You're trying to become a firefighter?
-Yes, a firefighter.

40
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,753
-I see. You're just starting.
-Yes.

41
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm still...

42
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,300
Are you wearing cow skin?

43
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,011
Yes, they're leather pants.

44
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,390
So, you're into fashion?

45
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,060
It's one of my interests.

46
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,021
I love stuff like this.

47
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,441
Since you're here...
Torichan, why don't you sit next to him?

48
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,109
What?

49
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,945
Is that how it's going to be?

50
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,073
-Why not for a little bit?
-Are you sure?

51
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,576
-Are you scared?
-Fine, I'll go then.

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,911
Is it such a big deal?

53
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,746
It seems like it took courage.

54
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,456
-So what are you going to do?
-What?

55
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,041
Are you really going to stay?

56
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,504
What? Well, I'm moving in today.

57
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,424
There's a romantic vibe here.

58
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,303
-Yes, well...
-Well, these two are going out.

59
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,513
How is it?

60
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,307
Living here and going out?

61
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,351
They're in the Japanese-style bedroom
every night.

62
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,686
Starting in the afternoon. It's crazy.

63
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,188
-No way! You can hear us?
-Yeah.

64
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,857
Oh, no!

65
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,901
-We can even hear you from the pool!
-Oh, my!

66
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,611
-From the pool?
-Yeah, it's something else.

67
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,823
-That's not good. We should be careful.
-Oh, man...

68
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,533
So... how long are we gonna keep this up?

69
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,704
Let's get started.

70
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,207
-Today's an important day.
-You're right.

71
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,210
-Okay.
-I know you want to mess around, but...

72
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,544
Let's be proper.

73
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,756
-Good evening, everyone.
-Good evening.

74
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,424
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women...

75
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,010
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

76
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,763
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

77
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,265
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

78
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,894
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes. Finally...

79
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,521
Tonight is the last episode.

80
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,732
And we are in <i>Terrace House!</i>

81
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,652
-It's nice. An amazing place.
-It's our first time here.

82
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,906
-It's amazing.
-This house is really amazing.

83
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,033
-There's an elevator.
-Yes, there's an elevator.

84
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,744
The one they kissed in front of.

85
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,871
-That's right!
-That's right, it's that elevator.

86
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,832
It's, like, don't do it there!
It's so easy to see!

87
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,834
Yeah, it's very visible.

88
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,502
It was there!

89
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,547
So, last week...

90
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,175
Let's take a look back.

91
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,304
Last week, the sixth couple formed
since the show started.

92
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,722
-Arman and Masako.
-Yes, Martha.

93
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,976
{\an8}It made me want to believe in you.

94
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,815
{\an8}-So, you'll go out with me?
-Yes, that's what I mean.

95
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,443
{\an8}Don't stare at me!

96
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,404
{\an8}<i>-They shared their first kiss on the boat.</i>
<i>-Yes, on the boat.</i>

97
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,448
{\an8}<i>Yes, they did.</i>

98
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,993
{\an8}And Rikopin and Hayato...

99
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,995
{\an8}I do like you.

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,624
{\an8}I want to go out with you.

101
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,879
{\an8}On Monday, in the evening,
I'll wait for you at the restaurant.

102
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,382
{\an8}If you think you can trust me again...

103
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,885
{\an8}then I want you to come.

104
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,013
{\an8}I still like him. But...

105
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,807
{\an8}I'm very worried.

106
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,934
{\an8}-You're still 18.
-Yeah.

107
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,145
{\an8}I think you should date more.

108
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,563
Yeah.

109
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,817
-She came back to Shinagawa station.
-That's right.

110
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,693
<i>-Will she go or not?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

111
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,362
<i>That's where we left off.</i>

112
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,866
<i>Terashima made dessert</i>
<i>and is waiting for her.</i>

113
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,036
-And you all think she'll go.
-Yes, I hope she does.

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,705
I'm sincerely hoping
she'll stand him up.

115
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,833
-Riko?
-Yes, for Riko to just cut him loose.

116
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,335
Her mom rather...

117
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,670
sort of pushed her to go for it.

118
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,423
-I think she'll go.
-I want her to!

119
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,841
We could have three couples.

120
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,428
I want to drink sake while watching
the scene where he gets axed.

121
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,098
Please!

122
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
{\an8}Make a wish!

123
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,478
{\an8}-With all your heart.
-I'll put my heart into it.

124
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,440
I want to be with Arman...

125
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,442
You're saying it out loud?

126
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,445
-What's your wish? Share it.
-No, no, no.

127
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,989
-Can I say it out loud?
-Sure.

128
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,657
Never mind. It's okay.

129
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,580
-Congratulations!
-Happy birthday!

130
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,433
Wait, wait.

131
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,809
Seriously?

132
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,188
Oh, no!

133
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,855
-Welcome home.
-I'm home.

134
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,608
-Come sit, Riko.
-Sit down.

135
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,070
-Thank you.
-Sure.

136
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,737
Welcome back.

137
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,786
I didn't go to the restaurant.

138
00:06:54,872 --> 00:07:00,295
I'm sure you gave it a lot of thought.

139
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,380
I thought hard about it.

140
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,009
I did think about going.

141
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,265
But I couldn't.

142
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,438
He said three different things.

143
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,774
I want to believe him...

144
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,404
but I can't right now.

145
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,660
You should message Hayato.

146
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,621
-Don't worry. I already have.
-You have?

147
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,331
-You have?
-Yeah.

148

00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,872
{\an8}-Hey.
-Welcome back.

155
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,916
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

156
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,253
-Good work.
-Good work.

157
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,385
-She didn't go.
-No, she didn't.

158
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,932
Maybe this is a weird thing to ask,
but how are you?

159
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,685
It's tough.

160
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,152
But that's the decision she made.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,406
I have to try and accept it.

162
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,952
At least there's closure.

163
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,539
Thanks for waiting up.

164
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,502
We weren't waiting up for that to happen.

165
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,422
I'm going to sleep.

166
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,635
I'll be okay. I'll be better tomorrow.

167
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,304
Yeah, rest up. Seriously.

168
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,807
I'm sorry I made you guys uncomfortable.

169
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,227
I'm sorry I haven't told Martha either.

170
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,503
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

171
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,633
-You're up early.
-Yeah.

172
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,762
You're wearing makeup.

173
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,973
-I have work today.
-It's early.

174
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,023
You thought it over...

175
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,027
and it's the decision you made.

176
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,779
So I'll take it.

177
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,531
I mean...

178
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,575
I'll accept it.

179
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,290
I'm sorry I made you feel bad.

180
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,297
We'll be normal roommates from now on.

181
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,884
I hope we can still be friends.

182
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,387
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

183
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,348
That would be better.

184
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,267
Okay.

185
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,563
-Friends then?
-Yeah, friends.

186
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,991
-Cut.
-Cut!

187
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,577
-She cut him loose.
-Yeah.

188
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,706
-That was unexpected.
-I thought she'd go talk to him.

189
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,250
But she didn't.

190
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,629
-You were drinking sake happily.
-Sake has never tasted better.

191
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,674
I wavered for a moment
and thought she might go.

192
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,176
But I'm glad I believed in her.
She cut him loose!

193
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:05,057
I feel like I witnessed a woman's strength
in those moments.

194
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,059
-I know what you mean.
-We did see it.

195
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,480
"We'll be roommates from now on."

196
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,232
"That would be better."

197
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,734
-That was...
-It was good.

198
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,404
-It was very mature.
-Yes.

199
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,365
For an 18-year-old, that much is true.

200
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,367
She made her decision.

201
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,577
"That would be better."
What a great line.

202
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,995
It was a good line.

203
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,499
And then there was the scene
with them sleeping naked in bed.

204
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,042
-That was a surprise.
-Yeah.

205
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,628
But with those two,

206
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,172
-it doesn't seem too graphic.
-That's true.

207
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:41,260
So it's heaven for the two couples,
and hell for the other two members.

208
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,721
That's what we're going to watch?

209
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,139
-I wonder.
-Yeah.

210
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,434
I don't know what's going to happen.

211
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,061
{\an8}-Oh, no.
-What?

212
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,855
{\an8}-It's starting to hit me.
-Yeah, it sucks.

213
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,408
This brings back memories.

214
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,414
The first letter Misaki gave me.

215
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,749
No way! What did I write?

216
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,921
"Thanks for the iron.
Let's go shopping together again."

217
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,050
-That's so cute.
-It's like in elementary school.

218
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,512
-It's really from when I first came.
-Yeah.

219
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,973
I saved it.

220
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,101
It brings back memories.

221
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,979
So what are you going to do, Arman?

222
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,732
-About what?
-With Martha?

223
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,568
I'll be in Japan
until the end of September.

224
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,365
-The end of September?
-No, I meant the end of August.

225
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,158
We'll take it slow.

226
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,245
Yuuki, you're not going to live together?

227
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,747
With Misaki?

228
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,291
Not at first.

229
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:58,170
You're used to this, though.
You'll probably miss her.

230
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,840
Yeah, we've talked about that.

231
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,760
But I told her she can come over any time.

232
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,345
It's nice that you live close
to each other.

233
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,931
You live close,
even if you don't live together.

234
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,058
-Yeah, that's true.
-You can see her when you want to.

235
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,477
I can see her when I want to.

236
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,187
But I'm going to make an effort.

237
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,482
Nice.

238
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,320
{\an8}YOMIURILAND

239
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,418
Nice.

240
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,752
You changed.

241
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,213
Do you still want this?

242
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,760
-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit.

243
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,221
{\an8}The flow pool...

244
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,890
{\an8}-It was fun.
-What?

245
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,059
{\an8}-It was fun.
-Yeah, it was fun.

246
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,938
It's coming to an end.

247
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,023
<i>Terrace House.</i>

248
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,442
Yeah.

249
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,237
-We can be alone now.
-Yeah.

250
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,325
That's something to be happy about.

251
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,372
Hayato and Riko seem fine.

252
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,418
-We can leave in peace.
-Yeah.

253
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,212
We can leave...

254
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,465
smiling happily.

255
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:10,553
You should stop.
You're going to start crying.

256
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,473
I'll be okay. I'm not alone anymore.

257
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,561
-After it's done, you mean.
-I have you now.

258
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,938
So I'll be okay.

259
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,695
{\an8}-You went to a water park?
-Yeah, we went to a water park.

260
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,447
-How was it?
-It was fun.

261
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,658
Which water park was it?

262
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,992
-Yomiuriland.
-Yomiuriland?

263
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,161
-Oh, Arman!
-What?

264
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,374
Don't worry about it.

265
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,171
-Yeah, I went a while back.
-That's right!

266
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,423
How are you two?

267
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,509
-The same.
-Yeah, the same.

268
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,137
Nice. There's an aura of happiness here.

269
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,557
You seem okay now.

270
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,100
Yeah, I'm totally good.

271
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,977
So you're roommates and friends now?

272
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,688
-Yeah.
-I see.

273
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,402
-I'm getting sad.
-Yeah, it's a little sad.

274
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,822
Living alone will be so lonely!

275
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,616
Alone? You're staying in Tokyo?

276
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,868
-Yeah, work is here.
-That's true.

277
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,163
Someone's home.

278
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,001
-It's so hot!
-Oh, it's Yuuki.

279
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,378
-It's so hot!
-It's hot!

280
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,010
We're here to visit!

281
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,805
Long time no see.

282
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,266
It's been a while!

283
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,980
Hansan!

284
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,147
Thank you!

285
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,818
-Riko! How have you been?
-Nacchan!

286
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,194
I can't see your face.

287
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,865
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm Natsumi Saito.

288
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,117
-I'm Martha. Nice to meet you.
-What?

289
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,203
-Martha. Nice to meet you.
-Martha? I'm Natsumi Saito.

290
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,289
Nice to meet you.

291
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,417
-She's embarrassed.
-I'm embarrassed because of Hansan.

292
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,506
I've been keeping in touch,
so I invited them.

293
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,134
-Really?
-It's nice to meet you.

294
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,552
{\an8}Hansan and Natsumi...

295
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,304
{\an8}-Nacchan.
-I'm Natsumi.

296
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,766
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

297
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,308
Oh, someone's home.

298
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,396
Welcome home.

299
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,942
-Hansan.
-Hey, how are you?

300
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,736
-You're Nacchan, right?
-Yes.

301
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,195
Byrnes?

302
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,365
-How are you?
-It's been a while.

303
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,869
I'm so surprised!

304
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,580
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

305
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,542
How have things been since you left?

306
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,335
-She went to Singapore.
-I want to hear.

307
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,297
-Yeah.
-You live in Singapore?

308
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,257
No, I don't live there.

309
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,844
I've been going overseas for work.

310
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,096
For commercial shoots...

311
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,683
and other little jobs.

312
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,810
-Do you have a boyfriend now?
-No.

313
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,103
-Anyone you like?
-There isn't anyone.

314
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,563
I see.

315
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,526
She looked at me like, "Poor you."

316
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,696
Did you see her face?

317
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,280
"I see."

318
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,953
That's great.
It brings back memories.

319
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,412
It's great. It was totally like this.

320
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,289
It brings back memories?

321
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,834
They're never on the same wavelength.

322
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,089
No, no. We understand each other.

323
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,675
It takes time to reach an understanding.

324
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,180
-What about you, Hansan?
-I've been building as usual.

325
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,016
I just finished a café yesterday.

326
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:49,438
I've also started doing something
other than architecture.

327
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,399
I'm preparing to sell furniture as well.

328
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,569
-Wow.
-That's amazing.

329
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,405
I can't survive without working.

330
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,574
-And you just graduated.
-Yeah.

331
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:05,037
But I have to study as well.

332
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,498
What about your girlfriend?
Are things going well?

333
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,126
Yeah, well,
I haven't been able to see her.

334
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,754
-You're so busy?
-You still haven't seen her that much?

335
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:18,926
I was pretty busy when I lived here,
but now she's busy.

336
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,511
We don't see each other.

337
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,640
-How's work going, Misaki?
-Me?

338
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,644
-It's so-so.
-So-so?

339
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,773
It's not so-so.
You've got things lined up.

340
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,274
You haven't talked about it?

341
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,984
Not really.

342
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,361
-A commercial...
-Seriously?

343
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,447
And a TV drama.
Tiny parts, though.

344
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:46,037
-I'll watch.
-Even a small part is good.

345
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>Terrace House</i> is ending.

346
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,583
We're all moving out next Monday.

347
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,044
-What?
-Yeah.

348
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,129
Really?

349
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,674
-Then I'm glad we came before.
-Yeah.

350
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,182
{\an8}It's the last day tomorrow.

351
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,643
Did it go by quickly for you?

352
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,395
Very quickly.

353
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,107
But a lot happened to you.

354
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,069
I didn't even like Arman at first.

355
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,737
-That's right.
-Yeah.

356
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,543
-Gross.
-It's pretty bad.

357
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,593
The last day of a luxurious lifestyle.

358
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,303
With that pool...

359
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,316
-I'll leave the trash bag here.
-Thank you.

360
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,734
That helps.

361
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,527
-Oh, Riko. Welcome back.
-I'm back.

362
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,529
-Riko's back.
-You're home early.

363
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,865
Am I?

364
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,034
I thought I was running late.
It's so clean.

365
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,161
What are you doing?

366
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,746
What was that?

367
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,416
I'm taking down the charms.

368
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,878
-Shouldn't Hayato take them down?
-That's true.

369
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,007
Oh, wow.

370
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,677
Is there anywhere that hasn't been wiped?

371
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,429
-There isn't.
-What about here?

372
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,231
Ready?

373
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,815
Watch your feet.

374
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,360
Done.

375
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,363
{\an8}Let's get in.

376
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,532
{\an8}-For the last time.
-Yeah, the last time.

377
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,994
-I wonder if it's cold.
-It'll be fine.

378
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,549
It feels so good!

379
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,219
Ready?

380
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,154
That was close!

381
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,115
-Prosciutto?
-No.

382
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,658
-What is it?
-It's meat.

383
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,203
-Looks good.
-Here.

384
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,620
Looks amazing.

385
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,871
Tongue.

386
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,623
-There's tongue, too?
-Yeah.

387
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,375
-Looks delicious.
-Looks delicious.

388
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,961
Feeling better?

389
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,379
-Are you feeling better?
-Yeah.

390
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,466
-It's gotten warm again lately.
-Yeah.

391
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,343
I wonder how long it'll last.

392
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,224
I'm really glad.

393
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,601
This has really been fun.

394
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,769
-It was fun.
-It was.

395
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,565
-Seriously fun.
-It's like I was a student again.

396
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,652
The last two months were the best.

397
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:10,199
We went camping, skateboarding.
I got in an accident, but...

398
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,243
it was really fun.

399
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,829
Let's all work hard starting tomorrow.

400
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,165
It's so sad. I'm really sad.

401
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,255
Everyone who lived at <i>Terrace House</i>
hasn't kept the sink area clean.

402
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,381
Yeah.

403
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,966
Even if you never clean it,
it wouldn't look like that.

404
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,970
-No, it wouldn't.
-What's coming out of them?

405
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,972
The kiss.

406
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,558
-It was so nice.
-The kiss at Yomiuriland.

407
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,394
Oh, the one in the pool.

408
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,438
-Yeah, inside the pool.
-And the tube!

409
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,776
Where the girl's in the tube
and the guy hangs on it like this?

410
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,488
So that's how couples do it.
I'm jealous!

411
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,283
-That's been around since the '80s.
-Yeah!

412
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,578
I guess that's been a thing
since my time.

413
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,914
Yeah, you always see that.

414
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,625
Pools are nice.
That couple is so...

415
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,710
They're so close.

416
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,671
-It's so nice!
-They're going out...

417
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,048
but could you say that?

418
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,509
"I'm not alone anymore, so I'll be okay."

419
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,678
-"Because you're here."
-"I'm so glad you're here."

420
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,098
They say it naturally, not jokingly.

421
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,642
-It's amazing.
-I'm so jealous!

422
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,688
And Arman and Martha, too.

423
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,149
-When they're cleaning.
-When they're messing around?

424
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,733
-That was nice, too.
-Yes, it was.

425
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,360
-Really great.
-It was very cute.

426
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,113
Neither one of those two guys...

427
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,824
really hides anything.

428
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,828
Isn't that nice to see?

429
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,122
That's what you should do.

430
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,207
Could you do it?

431
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,836
-Ken could do it.
-Yeah, I think so.

432
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,088
That's not fair.

433
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,925
I was the worst of the worst
when I was around Kentaro's age.

434
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,761
-I was the worst of the worst.
-What?

435
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,680
-How?
-What were you like?

436
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,890
-I was seeing four girls at once.
-What?

437
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,351
-Four?
-Yes, four.

438
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,980
So since I was always bringing
different girls home, my mom would say,

439
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,275
"Yoshimi, my home is not a love hotel."

440
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:11,862
I'd hate that.

441
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,491
-That's when I realized how bad it was.
-Yeah, if your mom had to say it.

442
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,868
When did you stop?

443
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,161
Probably two years ago.

444
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,538
-So recent.
-No, no.

445
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,583
-Well, we're at the end.
-It's the end of the end.

446
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,543
That was quick.
We're at the end already?

447
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,549
-Let's toast.
-Cheers.

448
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,552
{\an8}-Cheers.
-Cheers.

449
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,222
-This is our last night.
-The last celebration.

450
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,099
-Shall we have Arman lead it?
-Yeah.

451
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,310
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

452
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,362
I'm hungry.

453
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,156
-Should we start cooking?
-Let's cook.

454
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,451
What is everyone gonna do?

455
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:04,039
Ideally, I would live six months here
and six months in Hawaii.

456
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,584
When he asked me out,
he said he'd go back for two months.

457
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,961
That's what he said.

458
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,713
But he's changing what he said.

459
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:16,552
Beforehand, I would've said,
"That's different from what you said."

460
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,555
But it's Arman's life.
I want to support him.

461
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,516
And I have more things I want to do now.

462
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,101
And there are lots of things I need to do.

463
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:30,065
So if we can both work hard
and meet where we can...

464
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,568
That's so cool!

465
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,152
-Yeah.
-That's too cool.

466
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,614
We were saying
that we hope to live like that

467
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,826
and still be a good couple.

468
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,578
That's what we were saying.

469
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,120
Wow, that's great.

470
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,999
I'm so happy
that she really understands me.

471
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,084
What about you, Hayato?

472
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,505
I want to open my own restaurant.
My goal is to open one next year.

473
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,966
I'll go.

474
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,260
You never came!

475
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,304
-That's true, I never went.
-We should go.

476
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,097
-You didn't come once. Come.
-Let's go.

477
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,474
Come by after this show.

478
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:07,561
If you open a place,
Hansan can do the interior.

479
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,481
-It'd be nice if we can all do something.
-Yeah.

480
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,983
-We're all leaving tomorrow, right?
-Let's head out together.

481
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,193
We're all done after this meal.

482
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm about to cry.

483
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,044
It's been a long year.

484
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,046
Well, almost a year.

485
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,593
Oh, man.

486
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,221
Let's not talk about this.

487
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:46,725
Getting off at the same station,
walking down the same street...

488
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,977
That kind of thing.

489
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,481
We won't have that anymore.

490
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,170
It's cool in here.

491
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,713
It's cooler.

492
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,952
That's a nice top. It's cute.

493
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,456
-Isn't it?
-Yeah, when did you get it?

494
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,209
-Need a tissue?
-I'm okay.

495
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,218
It was a really good...

496
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,970
half year.

497
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,600
If we look up at the sky,
we'll all see the same moon.

498
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,977
That was cheesy. Too cheesy.

499
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,980
That was cheesy.

500
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,484
Are we all okay now?

501
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,533
Shall we go?

502
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,327
Let's go.

503
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,873
Here it is.

504
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,459
The day to take my own key has arrived.

505
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,835
It's arrived.

506
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,130
This is also my first time.

507
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,215
I've been using this for ten months.

508
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,062
-I'm off!
-I'm heading out!

509
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,440
-I'm leaving.
-I'm out!

510
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,233
I'm leaving.

511
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,735
Thank you!

512
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,655
Thank you very much.

513
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,948
Thank you.
