1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,767
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,851
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,145
{\an8}<i>living together, and we observe</i>
<i>how they interact with each other.</i>

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,732
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,068
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,154
{\an8}Many things happened last week.

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,240
{\an8}First, there was
Uchi and Minori's very nice date.

9
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,201
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,120
{\an8}Well, I asked you out because I like you.

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,165
{\an8}What do you mean, you like...

12
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,209
{\an8}Oh, I'm so bad with this stuff!

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,211
{\an8}<i>He told her he liked her.</i>

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,215
Minori didn't answer, but was embarrassed,
like, "Oh no, what should I do?"

15
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,677
-And Makoto...
-You almost forgot, didn't you?

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,597
Ma-ko-to.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,516
He gave Minori sneakers as a present,

18
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,144
and they went for an evening run together.

19
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,896
{\an8}And gave you the shoes.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,900
{\an8}So, until the season is over,
I wanted to close the gap between us.

21
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,612
{\an8}After the season, when I have more time,

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,989
{\an8}maybe we can go somewhere.

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,991
{\an8}That's what I was thinking.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,117
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,079
{\an8}He said a line that will go down
in <i>Terrace House</i> history.

26
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,164
"And gave you the shoes."

27
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:27,254
The way things ended
for Yuki and Yuriko...

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,465
-That was shocking, right?
-It was shocking.

29
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,094
{\an8}You remember how I once told you about
how I broke up with my ex?

30
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,388
{\an8}I haven't been able to forget him.

31
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,474
{\an8}I think I should take the initiative
and call him,

32
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,769
{\an8}and tell him I miss him.

33
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,936
{\an8}That's good.

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,688
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD
YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD

35
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,357
{\an8}-It's a good day.
-A good day.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,276
{\an8}<i>"It's a good day."</i>

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,993
<i>What a good day</i>

38
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:03,999
And Mr. Chou would appear and say,
"How about an ending to love like this."

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,044
You guys are terrible.

40
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,839
Aren't you getting sick of people?

41
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,801
-That's not true, right?
-No, not at all.

42
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,510
Just a little bit more.

43
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,889
That's what a monster would say.

44
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,974
"See, humans are no good."

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,352
I think I might see a tail behind me.

46
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,574
{\an8}GIRLS AWARD AUDITIONS

47
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,837
Is this your first time
auditioning for a runway show?

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,421
-Yes, it's my first time.
-Your first?

49
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,300
{\an8}Then imagine
30,000 attendees watching you.

50
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,719
{\an8}TOSHIYA UO
DIVISION DIRECTOR

51
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,054
{\an8}Please walk with that image in mind.

52
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,224
You're entertaining 30,000 people.

53
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,572
What did you think?

54
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,287
The clothes for this show,
Jill by Jill Stuart, are a little...

55
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,332
We have this image of the models

56
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,377
wearing something chic.

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,422
So that image, and as I mentioned earlier,

58
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,385
30,000 attendees will be watching you
the entire time.

59
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,680
So we want your walk to be fun,

60
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,475
and still express our brand.

61
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,229
In that sense, you're still too stiff.

62
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,065
But I hope you work at it.

63
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,693
I'll work on it.

64
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,946
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

65
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,837
She could be good.
She has long limbs.

66
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,673
She's got a clean look.

67
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,094
She's still too stiff.

68
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,139
-But the clothes look good on her.
-Yes.

69
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,450
Hello? This is Yuriko.

70
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,870
It's been awhile.

71
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,498
I'm sorry for calling so suddenly.
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:56,213
Oh, thank you for the LINE message.

73
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,174
And...

74
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,803
I thought it'd be nice...

75
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,140
to see you again.

76
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,017
Could we meet?

77
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,487
-Hey.
-Game?

78
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,531
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

79
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,408
-By yourself?
-Yeah.

80
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,661
What's up?

81
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,918
-I wanted to talk to you.
-What is it?

82
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,839
We went running the other day, right?

83
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,218
I've been thinking about stuff since then.

84
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,431
I was wondering about your timing.

85
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,603
I thought if I let things be,

86
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,148
you'd lean toward Uchi.

87
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:04,197
I'll take that to mean
that you're interested in me.

88
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,369
But the next time we decide to hang out,

89
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:15,458
it's not intended to mean
I'm responding to your feelings toward me.

90
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,503
That's how I feel right now.

91
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,509
We got along so well at first.

92
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,220
I said I was interested in you.

93
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,890
I liked you, but...

94
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,185
to be honest...

95
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,479
I had no idea what you were thinking
or what you wanted to do.

96
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,525
You'd say you were going to ask me out,

97
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,695
but wouldn't follow through.

98
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,489
And so I went on a date with Uchi,

99
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:51,494
but then you got upset,
and wouldn't talk to me.

100
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,621
Well, it wasn't that
you didn't talk to me,

101
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,290
but you were obviously avoiding me.

102
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,875
I wasn't avoiding you.

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,004
It was just plain jealousy.

104
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,965
But that happened...

105
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,718
and it would be an overstatement
to say I was disgusted...

106
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,305
but I didn't like it.

107
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,890
And so at this time,

108
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:18,688
I don't want to go out with you again.

109
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,774
So that's where you're at?

110
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,279
Got it.

111
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,577
-Sorry to bother you.
-Later.

112
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,080
-Good night.
-Good night.

113

4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

119
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,605
{\an8}-Hey.
-Hey to you.

120
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,983
-Everyone's still awake today?
-Yeah.

121
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,902
I was...

122
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,698
talking with Minori downstairs.

123
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,618
I told her we should hang out
after my season ends.

124
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,580
-Yeah, I remember you saying that.
-You asked her out?

125
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,872
But then...

126
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,126
she said something about bad timing.

127
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,586
What timing?

128
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,631
Us going out after baseball.

129
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,384
But she said she didn't want to.

130
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,303
-She rejected you?
-Yeah, she said no.

131
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,305
Really? Why?

132
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,517
She knows I like her
but can't reciprocate, or something.

133
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,270
She said something like that.

134
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,732
She didn't say it outright,
but I guess she dumped me.

135
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,776
-Dumped?
-Yeah.

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,655
-Without telling her you liked her?
-I never told her.

137
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,367
You never clearly told her your feelings.

138
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,786
So I don't think you'd get a clear answer.

139
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,124
-So you were wrong?
-I was wrong.

140
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:49,547
Wow, so Makoto finally admits
that he was wrong.

141
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,840
-I'm glad.
-He was wrong?

142
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,926
-He was wrong.
-But when he was dumped,

143
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,262
how did you want him to react?

144
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:01,559
In the guys' room,
I wanted him to say, "Good luck."

145
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,270
-To Tatsuya.
-Oh, I see.

146
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,356
-"It didn't work out for me, so..."
-"Good luck to you."

147
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,026
Man, you're so thoughtful
to come up with something like that.

148
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,446
I was thinking
Uchihara was laughing hysterically inside.

149
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,574
Not hysterically.

150
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,618
No, not laughing hysterically.

151
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,288
I thought he was pinching himself.

152
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,582
Too obvious!

153
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,670
-It was good Minori spoke up.
-It was.

154
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:35,677
Because she feels his interest,
even though he hasn't said anything,

155
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,680
and she tells him clearly
that she won't reciprocate.

156
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,350
-Why couldn't Yuriko do that, too?
-I knew you would say that.

157
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:47,147
Even her call to her ex,
wasn't it kind of nasty?

158
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,192
-I think it was normal.
-What?

159
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,652
I felt like I was watching a reenactment.

160
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,615
From what she said, it's obvious
that she wants to get back together.

161
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,329
Yeah, for the guy, it's just a matter of
when and if he wants.

162
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,415
It was too obvious.

163
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,170
But if Yuriko was the one
who dumped him in the first place,

164
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:14,131
then the guy must be happy
that she came back.

165
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,925
{\an8}Busy day?

166
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,971
{\an8}Yeah, it was crazy.
A girl from Hokkaido came to see me.

167
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,224
-I was moved.
-Wow, she watches <i>Terrace House?</i>

168
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,685
-Yeah, she saw the show.
-Wow!

169
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,979
-What a nice day.
-Yeah, it was nice.

170
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,441
-You know how we practiced walking?
-Oh yeah, we practiced together.

171
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,735
Together? I don't understand.

172
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:38,490
-I was practicing for the audition.
-Yeah, I watched as she practiced.

173
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,243
-It was for Girls Award.
-The one you mentioned before?

174
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,370
-Oh, really?
-You said you were going.

175
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,665
I did, and I passed the audition.

176
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,835
-That's a big one. Congrats! Wow!
-Congratulations!

177
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,796
-That's impressive.
-I have to practice.

178
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,425
Is there something we can do to help?

179
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,886
Hmm, something we can do?

180
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,513
Come get your hair done.

181
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,348
-What?
-Come get your hair done.

182
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,642
Treatment and head massage.

183
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,893
I want a head massage!

184
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,395
-Oh, nice!
-Sure.

185
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,272
I want a head massage!

186
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:15,318
-It's a nice day today.
-Yeah, it's a nice day.

187
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,322
BLAST
DAIKAN-YAMA, TOKYO

188
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,616
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

189
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,285
{\an8}Let's start the morning meeting.

190
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,745
{\an8}Any announcements?

191
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,497
{\an8}MIKI TAKEUCHI, DIRECTOR OF THE SALON

192
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,126
{\an8}Today is a holiday,
and we expect to be busy around 2:00 p.m.

193
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,212
So, please plan ahead in the morning

194
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,840
along with your assistant.

195
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,636
Also, we have a job offer.

196
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,807
There's a hair and make-up job
on October 24th.

197
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,935
It's the hair and make-up for Girls Award.

198
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,814
It's for a few of the models.

199
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,191
The members currently assigned are

200
00:12:55,274 --> 00:13:01,280
Nishikaji, Otani, Kojima,
me, and Uchihara.

201
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,284
Once we work out the details,
I'd like to have another meeting.

202
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,498
{\an8}MARUNOUCHI, TOKYO

203
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,428
{\an8}-How are you?
-How are you?

204
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,138
{\an8}TADAMICHI KAWANO, M.D.
YURIKO'S EX-BOYFRIEND

205
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,557
{\an8}-Did you wait long?
-No, not at all.

206
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,226
-I went ahead and sat.
-Oh, that's all right.

207
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,187
I thought you'd bring me a Hepalyse.

208
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,441
It's seriously been awhile.

209
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,777
You've been busy, right?
What department are you in now?

210
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,404
Nephrology now.

211
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,155
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

212
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,949
Are you pretty busy, too?

213
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,997
Mmm, exams are coming... in a week.

214
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,332
-In a week?
-What? Yes.

215
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,002
Are you ready for them?

216
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,715
-Look so good.
-Yeah.

217
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,759
-You like bagna càuda, right?
-Yeah.

218
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,886
-You liked it, right?
-Yeah.

219
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,471
I remember it...

220
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,933
It's been awhile
since I've had such good food.

221
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,687
You usually don't eat much?

222
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,773
I rarely eat out.

223
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,400
At the hospital?

224
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,361
I've eaten most of the food
delivered to the hospital.

225
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,154
Of course.

226
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,748
-You surprised me.
-Where are you looking?

227
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,750
This way, please.

228
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,589
-Head massage and treatment, right?
-Yes, please.

229
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,008
"Yes, please"?

230
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,177
I'll take care of you.

231
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,641
-What? What?
-I get to see you work.

232
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,435
This is embarrassing.

233
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,339
-Does it hurt?
-No, it feels nice.

234
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,646
The massage is done.

235
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,233
Relaxed?

236
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,819
Relaxed. It felt really good.

237
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,450
It's so soft.

238
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,912
-Silky, right?
-Yeah, silky. It's amazing.

239
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,914
Super silky, right?

240
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,125
You know what?

241
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,045
If you make me dinner, we'll call it even.

242
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,213
Really?

243
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,842
What kind of food?

244
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,385
Think of something for me.

245
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,096
-Oh, there it is again.
-Yep.

246
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,182
-I don't even know what you like.
-Think of something for me.

247
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,937
Pasta?

248
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,356
You're gonna make pasta for me?

249
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,108
Yeah.

250
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,319
-When?
-Whenever you want.

251
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,490
-Today works for me.
-All right.

252
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,578
So today, um...

253
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,623
There's something I want to tell you...

254
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,710
which is why I asked you out.

255
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:48,299
We broke up in a positive way.

256
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,678
But really...

257
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,308
I haven't been able to forget.

258
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,731
I still love you.

259
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,776
I thought maybe we could start over.

260
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,655
Or I thought...

261
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,911
When you called me asking to meet,

262
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,913
I was honestly happy...

263
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,001
and I was looking forward to seeing you.

264
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:29,549
But seeing you in person today
and talking like this...

265
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,637
I felt like it wasn't really like you.

266
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:41,143
You told me
you couldn't forget about us...

267
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,731
but it didn't quite make me feel ecstatic.

268
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:50,319
Before exams, we always tried
to focus on our own studies.

269
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,072
At least while we were together.

270
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,869
I know you're looking for an answer,

271
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:03,082
but I'd rather you concentrate
on your studies as a med student now.

272
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,003
I can't give you an answer right now.

273
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:12,258
After I get through exams...

274
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,177
will I be able to get an answer?

275
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,597
I think I'd like to
give you an answer then.

276
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,766
I understand.

277
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,856
Oh, wow.
How was your head massage?

278
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,525
It's so soft now, and it felt really good.

279
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,612
-So you're all ready.
-Not even close.

280
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,656
I can't walk straight yet.

281
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,074
-You're practicing today too, right?
-Yeah.

282
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,201
-It's going to take a while, right?
-Yeah.

283
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,495
-Call me when you want to practice.
-Okay.

284
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,080
I'll help you.

285
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,673
-Oh, you're cooking.
-I'm cooking.

286
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,383
Looks so good!

287
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,927
Bon appétit.

288
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,727
It's delicious.

289
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,688
What's my score?

290
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,230
A hundred points.

291
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,608
All right, I got three stars.

292
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,072
It's almost the Girls Award thing.

293
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,990
Which brand are you working for?

294
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:22,078
It's still in discussion,
so I still don't know the details.

295
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,537
I see.

296
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,500
But afterward,
we should go out for dinner.

297
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,213
-Okay.
-Whenever our schedules work.

298
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,006
You're not busy afterward?

299
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,801
I think it'll calm down.

300
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,845
I want something tasty.

301
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,138
Then let's get something tasty.

302
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,100
So soft...

303
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,646
{\an8}You're posing here and there, right?

304
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,107
Go ahead.

305
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,660
Minori!

306
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,709
Good!

307
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,672
-Looking at it, what do you think?
-Yeah, it's actually straight.

308
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:21,178
You don't do that thing anymore
where your left foot goes out to the side.

309
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,974
-I think the practice is paying off.
-I'm glad.

310
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,394
Of course, you were working so hard.

311
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,357
If I'd started working on it
a long time ago,

312
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,985
it wouldn't have been like this.

313
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,446
Have confidence.

314
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,407
Thank you.

315
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,953
Uchi and Minori are set now.

316
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,663
For sure.

317
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,456
The head massage...

318
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,500
What you said was classic Professor Tokui.

319
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,002
Please say it again.

320
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,586
It's an Indian foreplay.

321
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,174
The <i>Kama-sutra.</i>

322
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,428
-Head massages are an Indian foreplay.
-Thank you very much.

323
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,638
All that steam, with his hands...

324
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,683
Oh, stop that movement.

325
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,395
And plus, her face is here.

326
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,108
And so to come over like this,
to get close like this is fresh, isn't it?

327
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,860
-Here...
-Her face...

328
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,989
The face...

329
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,159
Stop! You're troubling Ayumu.

330
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,078
Ayumu, close your eyes
and cover your ears!

331
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,290
You're too good for this place.

332
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,127
But Yuriko's ex...

333
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,963
He's such a good guy!

334
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,924
Anyone who wears a sweater like that
is not a bad person.

335
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,676
The one with the white spots
around the top?

336
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,304
No bad person wears that.
Sawabe used to wear that.

337
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,557
-Oh yeah, a good guy then.
-Definitely a good guy.

338
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,311
-But that was a stylish scene.
-You're right.

339
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,857
She tells her ex
that she wants to get back together,

340
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,774
and he replies, "That's not like you."

341
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,028
Mr. Tokui, somehow when you say it,

342
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,654
it comes out sounding a little dirty.

343
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,826
Really? But I wasn't trying.

344
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,160
It's just natural to you.

345
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,288
Oh, so it's kneaded
into the dough already.

346
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,542
-Like spinach pasta.
-Oh, I see.

347
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,755
Do you remember
our nasty comments from last week?

348
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,341
-What did we say?
-"Oh, he saw her on TV."

349
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,638
"I'd hit that one more time.
Just one more time."

350
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,727
{\an8}He probably saw her on TV and thought,
"Hey, she looks pretty good."

351
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,148
{\an8}Yeah, he probably thought
maybe one more time.

352
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,609
{\an8}Just one more time.

353
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,987
You said he was trying
to do her one more time!

354
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,571
He did say that.

355
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,323
That was Tokui!

356
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,492
That was me.
I deeply apologize!

357
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,701
We're so sorry.

358
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,623
When I'm hurt,
I'd like for you to treat my injury.

359
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,754
{\an8}So I...

360
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,549
have an announcement.

361
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,010
What is it?

362
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,098
The league matches end on October 18th.

363
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,766
I told you before, right?

364
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,979
And when it's over...

365
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,359
-I'm thinking of moving out.
-For real?

366
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,738
-When you're done with baseball?
-Yeah.

367
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,366
I'm thinking of moving out.

368
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,743
Well, not really thinking.

369
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,288
I've already decided.

370
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,503
What made you decide?

371
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,965
After baseball is over...

372
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,885
I want to think about
what my next move will be.

373
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,264
And I considered doing that here.

374
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,475
But if I really want to move forward,

375
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,021
I think I need to put more pressure
on myself.

376
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,067
Even if it's not as a baseball player,

377
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,652
I'm sure there are lots of other paths.

378
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,365
I'm sure there are.

379
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,868
Both of you guys are independent.

380
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,788
You're both working, and seeing that...

381
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,835
Something...

382
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,381
I felt something.
