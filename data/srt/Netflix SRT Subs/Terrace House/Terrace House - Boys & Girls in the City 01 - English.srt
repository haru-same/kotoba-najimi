1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,097
It's been a while, everyone.

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,099
It's been a while.

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,394
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,606
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,276
{\an8}All that we've prepared
is a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,071
As usual, there is no script at all.

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,698
No, there is not.

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:36,328
<i>Terrace House</i> has now
been revived by Netflix.

9
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,205
Wow. Amazing.

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,459
It's an amazing thing.
Netflix came to our shores

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,671
and showed their interest
in <i>Terrace House.</i>

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,882
They may have said,
"We must do <i>Terrace House."</i>

13
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,844
Japanese with a foreign accent.

14
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,887
They were like,
"I want to see Tokui."

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,932
Did they actually say "Tokui"?

16
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,476
I'm so honored.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,519
So this studio...

18
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,857
Yes, this is a Netflix office.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,149
I see.

20
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,402
What a great place!

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,154
Isn't it?

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,573
Amazing.

23
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,743
I would like to greet
a new member to our team.

What do you think of the show?

32
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:42,645
I watch it with my mother.
I get really emotional.

33
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,229
Oh, you're that type.

34
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,649
Did anyone leave an impression on you?

35
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,193

Well, Ms. Kakei was very determined.

Oh, stop!
I'm going to melt.

39
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,788
All this brilliance.

40
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,998
Melting from this overwhelming brilliance.

41
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,499
You just can't take it.

42
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,461
-So this is the new title.

00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,592
And it will be located in Tokyo.

45
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,304
Last time it was in Shonan.

46
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,932
And this house is brand new.

47
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,935

-I used to play soccer.
-Oh, really?

156
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,068
In high school.
I joined the team but quit right away.

157
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,319
I got too busy with dance.

158
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,113

I also work as a barista there
twice a week.

162
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,042
What's a barista?

163
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,459

Another one?

167
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,351
-I was... a little nervous.
-It's a guy.

168
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,020

A sewing machine?

00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,819
He seems nice and fresh.

172
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,279
He's holding something.

173
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,988
-It's a sewing machine.
-Sewing machine?

174
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,365
He brought a sewing machine.

175
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,159
Here he is.

176
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,786
Is it okay if I sit here?

177
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,413
Excuse me.

178
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,374
-I look forward to living with you.
-Likewise.

179
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,462
I am Tatsuya Uchihara.
I'm 23 years old.

180
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,130
What's that?

181
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,965
Oh, it's my favorite age.

182
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,175
Really?

183
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,054
{\an8}-I'm a hair stylist at Daikan-yama.
-A hair stylist.

184
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,680
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD
HAIR STYLIST

185
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,101
-Why the sewing machine?
-Sewing machine?

186
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,479
I've recently got into sewing.
So the machine is for clothes.

187
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,813
-You make them?
-Yes, I make them.

188
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,065
Separate from work?

189
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,151
Yes, aside from work.
It's just a simple hobby.

190
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,319
Wow.

191
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,204
Someone's here.

192
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,914
It's heavy.

193
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,750
She said it's heavy.

194
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,752
-Should we help?
-Oh, she's up.

195
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,003
Oh.

196
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,713
-Did she see us?
-She hasn't.

197
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,343
She's reacting to the room.

198
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,886
That's right.

199
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,429
-Hello.
-Hello.

200
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,223
Hello.

201
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,974
Phew. It's heavy.

202
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,727
Guys, help her.
Please help.

203
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,024
I look forward to living with you.

204
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,442
Likewise.

205
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,031
Excuse me.

206
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,953
I am Yuriko Hayata.
I'm 23 years old.

207
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,623
What do you do?

208
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,169
I'm in my fourth year of university.

209
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,253
Ah.

210
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,713
What type of university?

211
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,799
It's a medical university.

212
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,176
Wow.

213
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,344
-Medicine.
-A doctor?

214
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,429
{\an8}Yes, I aspire to be one.
Yes.

215
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,847
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD, MED STUDENT
4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

216
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,932
{\an8}Well, I haven't become one yet.

217
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,392
{\an8}-But...
-I'm going for it.

218
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,976
Amazing.

219
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,732
Wow, I've never been in a place like this.

220
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,984
There's a pool, too.

221
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,861
-It's amazing.
-Wow! You're right!

222
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,697
-There's a pool.
-A pool.

223
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,948
What?

224
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,950
Let's have fun this month.

225
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,952
-Of course.
-Yes.

226
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,039
Yes! So it begins.

227
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,458
So it starts.

228
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,627
The girls are beautiful.

229
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,919
All of them.

230
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,463
{\an8}The three girls are quite distinct
from one another.

231
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,672
{\an8}-Yes.
-You think so, too?

232
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,384
{\an8}Yuriko is like, you know, girlie.

233
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,803
{\an8}-Yes.
-And Minori is the lively model.

234
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,305
{\an8}Yes, with the exotic look.

235
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,431
{\an8}Right?

236
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,017
{\an8}And then Mizuki is the career woman.

237
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,519
{\an8}Very frank.

238
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,312
{\an8}She also works as a barista.

239
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,897
{\an8}-Really.
-Wow.

240
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,566
So out of the three,
you would be, more or less...

241
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,944
-Yes.
-...interested in Yuriko Hayata?

242
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,613
-Yes.
-I see.

243
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,822
She is very attractive.

244
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,660
Any guy would be
into someone like Yuriko.

245
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,787
-Any guy.
-For sure.

246
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,707
Generally, though, at first glance,
you can say which person

247
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,751
most guys would be into.

248
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:36,381
But she could be the type
that would slowly reveal her dark side.

249
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,550
-Yes, well, it was like that before.
-You are right.

250
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,217
What about the guys?

251
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,803
{\an8}That hair stylist...

252
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,388
{\an8}-Tatsuya.
-He is so handsome.

253
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,848
{\an8}-There it is.
-Teacher Triendl.

254
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,142
{\an8}What is that?

255
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,394
He works at Daikan-yama.

256
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,520
He's invincible.

257
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,148
There's nothing negative about him.

258
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,733
He's tall, too.

259
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,944
And his hobby is making clothes.

260
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,863
I hope he has bad taste, at least.
Then I can laugh at him.

261
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,408
"How could you make this appliqué!"

262
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,119
You need something like that
or he has no flaws.

263
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,663
Wouldn't there be a struggle?

264
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:13,668
{\an8}Well, Makoto had those pit stains,
being anxious and all.

265
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,879
{\an8}Doesn't that come across badly
with women?

266
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,798
-No.
-Not at all.

267
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,841
Really?

268
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,092
He's fine.

269
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,635
He seems to be full of vigor.

270
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,929
Yamasato, you just don't know anything.

271
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,475
You really haven't learned anything.

272
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,059
{\an8}Is it the tap dancer
that's in trouble, then?

273
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,979
{\an8}What do you mean, "in trouble"?

274
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,897
{\an8}Yes, that's all you're talking about.

275
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,984
{\an8}I want to figure out now who is going
to be my target for the next 18 episodes.

276
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,194
{\an8}Throughout 18 episodes?

277
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,990
{\an8}Wow, amazing.

278
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,578
{\an8}-Fantastic.
-This is great.

279
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,829
This is amazing.

280
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,498
Look at that kitchen!

281
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,832
So who can cook?

282
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,001
Who can cook?

283
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,545
It would be a waste if no one can cook.

284
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,672
-Wow.
-Amazing.

285
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,924
-Amazing.
-Do you cook?

286
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,009
I don't cook.

287
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,552
This makes me want to cook.

288
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,347
I think the women
can make good use of this.

289
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,432
The men here aren't too--

290
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,183
I think we've got our hands full
with all of this!

291
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,727
A dishwasher.

292
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,147
We got a dishwasher?
I'm so happy.

293
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,859
{\an8}Amazing!

294
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,528
{\an8}I wanted to try it.

295
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,613
{\an8}This is great.

296
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,782
This is so nice.

297
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,660
It's soft.

298
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,537
-This is nice.
-So nice.

299
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,788
Awesome.

300
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,040
This is great.
How many meters is it?

301
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,959
-Awesome.
-Fifteen meters?

302
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,420
What about upstairs?

303
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,047
Incredible.

304
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,715
Yes, I wonder about upstairs.

305
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,842
It looks very spacious.

306
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,894
{\an8}Wow, a bunk bed.

307
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,270
{\an8}Amazing.

308
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,897
{\an8}-The girls get bunks too?
-Adorable.

309
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,733
{\an8}Come over here.

310
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,944
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

311
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,779
Wow! Wow!

312
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,531
What is it?

313
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,990
Amazing!

314
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,744
-Wow.
-Is there a Jacuzzi?

315
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,747
-It's there for sure.
-Yes, it's there.

316
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,708
Is that a TV?

317
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,250
A TV!

318
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,211
This is awesome.

319
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,297
There are three shower heads

320
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,757
-so we can all shower together.
-So we can all shower together.

321
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,175
You're right.

322
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,260
Ready, go!

323
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,138
We're the same.

324
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,264
That's mine.

325
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,641
Okay, you're over there.

326
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,352
Rock, paper, scissors?

327
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,395
First time rock.
Rock, paper, scissors!

328
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,772
Right, so I'm over here.

329
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,402
-Do you want to switch once a month?
-Want to? Monthly.

330
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,572
Amazing.

331
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,198
This is great.

332
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,577
Okay, here we are.

333
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,204
{\an8}This is nice.

334
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,164
{\an8}Three beds.

335
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,625
{\an8}It's a cool design.

336
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,753
{\an8}Who will go where?

337
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,631
I'm not sure which one is the best.

338
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,092
-I want to go up top because I am tall.
-Yeah?

339
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,471
-I don't really care.
-Me neither.

340
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,889
No, really.

341
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
Really, is it okay?

342
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,810
Yeah, no problem.

343
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,228
I'll be here.

344
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,814
I get the top?

345
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,483
Yes, it's all right.

346
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,442
Hey, I just realized,

347
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:29,697
I'll hit my head on the ceiling.
Ouch!

348
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,448
Can we switch?

349
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,742
Where do you want to be?

350
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,578
Would you like to be here?

351
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,539
-Yes, over there.
-Right, so I'll go up.

352
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,749
You can take this one, too.

353
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,208
This is fine.

354
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,252
Does it fit you perfectly?

355
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,006
Well, perfect or not,
you need to try it to see if it works.

356
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,257
Sure.

357
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,885
So...

358
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,470
The next one?

359
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,972
Another room.

360
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,643
{\an8}This is awesome.

361
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,477
{\an8}Nice.

362
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,230
{\an8}-This is like a conference room.
-Check out the cabinets.

363
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,232
This is amazing.

364
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,652
A TV.

365
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,945
There it is.

366
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:14,241
This is the place where
we bring our stories and talk.

367
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,453
-While we drink.
-Can you drink?

368
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,538
No, I can't.

369
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,791
And you, Makoto?

370
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,167
Yes, I can.

371
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,669
I can drink a lot.

372
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,253
I can't drink at all.

373
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,172
What will you do instead?

374
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,424
I'll drink a cola instead.

375
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,468
-A cola?
-I'll talk while drinking cola.

376
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,639
{\an8}We need to go shopping.
There's probably no food.

377
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,769
Pots. Kettle.

378
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,147
I think that turns on.

379
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,358
-The women...
-Huh?

380
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,651
Cooking.

381
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,778
-What are you guys doing?
-Are you cooking?

382
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,572
-I'm getting hungry.
-How are your rooms?

383
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,281
The rooms are amazing.

384
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,242
I'm hungry.

385
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,077
-Yes.
-What do you want to eat?

386
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,622
I like omu-rice.

387
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,415
-How cute.
-He's cute.

388
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,001
-So cute.
-Omelet filled with rice?

389
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,961
It's not something
everyone can eat together.

390
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,840
-Yeah.
-You can't make it in a single batch.

391
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,636
Can we let the women
take care of the cooking?

392
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,596
No, I don't think that will be the case.

393
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,766
-How are your skills?
-Not that good.

394
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,517
This is where you can impress us.

395
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,688
No, I don't like this vibe
of being judged or something.

396
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,858
-Tatsuya looks down on people.
-I'm generally strong-minded.

397
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,944
-Well...
-It's just that we're hungry, so...

398
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,655
Let's not get hung up about cooking.

399
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,572
What about hand roll sushi?

400
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,286
-Oh, that sounds nice.
-Yeah, we can make them as we eat.

401
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,997
So we go to the supermarket?

402
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,207
Rock or paper, go!

403
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,794
-Oh, man.
-Okay, let's go with that.

404
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,634
Did the girls talk?

405
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,719
-About what?
-You know, whatever.

406
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,681
Do you think you girls will get along?

407
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,223
-We are fine.
-Yes.

408
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,517
And you guys?

409
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,561
We are totally fine.

410
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,523
Though I think Tatsuya
is a little peculiar.

411
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,067
I mean, something...

412
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm so hungry.

413
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,531
What's Tatsuya up to?

414
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,950
Isn't he taking a long time?

415
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,993
Did he say he was taking a shower?

416
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,705
He'll be doing this a lot.

417
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,206
Right now?

418
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,251
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

419
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,670
I took a bath.

420
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,221
What will you do tomorrow?

421
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,139
What shall I do?

422
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,641
-Study?
-Study?

423
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,227
It's summer vacation, right?

424
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,561
Yes, it is.

425
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,814
You don't cook?
Do you live by yourself?

426
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,315
Yes, I do.

427
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,609
-I sometimes eat out.
-Do you have a specialty?

428
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,027
A specialty?

429
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,947
Let's see.
Traditional?

430
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,531
You can cook traditional Japanese?

431
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,408
Well, traditional simmered dishes.

432
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,827
-Isn't that difficult?
-Really?

433
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,078
Yes, simmered dishes.

434
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,331
So make some for me next time.

435
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,750
Make you some simmered dishes?

436
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,879
{\an8}NISSIN WORLD DELICATESSEN
AZABU-JUBAN, TOKYO

437
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,630
What was it he said?

438
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,798
Green tea, shampoo...

439
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:16,966
Sake.

440
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,718
But I don't know much about sake.

441
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,052
It doesn't matter.

442
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,428
Where is the shopping cart?

443
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,639
-Vegetables, this way?
-Vegetables, this way?

444
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,891
There's lettuce.

445
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:25,975
Let's get some lettuce.

446
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,477
What about cucumber?

447
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,688
-Yes. Cucumber.
-Tomatoes.

448
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,275
Which one?
This one?

449
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,526
Leafy?

450
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,652
How much?

451
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,196
-This is 2,000 yen.
-2,000 yen?

452
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,408
This is going to be
a really expensive dinner for us.

453
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,827
-It's fine. It's the first night.
-You're right.

454
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,082
-So let's have a toast.
-Good idea.

455
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,001
{\an8}So, cheers.

456
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,252
{\an8}Cheers!

457
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,130
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

458
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,589
Cheers!

459
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,223
This looks so good.

460
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,684
Oh, you went for the salmon.

461
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,061
Delicious.

462
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,855
When is everyone waking up tomorrow?

463
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,440
Tomorrow we're going for a swim.

464
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,817
-Our group is going to take it easy.
-Yes.

465
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,069
Yes, we decided on getting in the pool.

466
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,155
Tomorrow is my regular working day.

467
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,239
Are you off on weekends?

468
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,283
Usually, yes.

469
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,536
But often there are soccer matches
on weekends.

470
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,581
Then I take a day off
during the week.

471
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,083
I see.

472
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,876
But you like baseball.

473
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,544
-I also like it.
-Earlier you said...

474
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,302
Is there someone you like, Tatsuya?

475
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,762
-What?
-All of a sudden.

476
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,474
-We have to make sure we ask you.
-What do you mean, someone I like?

477
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,351
A hair stylist would be popular.

478
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,061
There's no one right now.

479
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,437
So you're recruiting?

480
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,441
Yes, I'm recruiting a girlfriend.
That's why I'm here.

481
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,945
-That's why you're here?
-Whoa!

482
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,446
Amazing.

483
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,824
Does everyone here
have a significant other?

484
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,076
No, I don't right now.

485
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,371
So, just casually, what is your type?

486
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,582
Just casually...

487
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,417
Maybe it's not a good time
to get a drink right now.

488
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,587
He heard.
He can hear.

489
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,047
I'm listening.

490
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,635
Well, someone who tries hard
and someone I can respect.

491
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,678
-Respect, yes.
-That's important.

492
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,681
-What about appearance?
-Appearance?

493
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,684
I like cute-looking guys.

494
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,353
-Cute-looking?
-Cute-looking guys?

495
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,480
Aren't you a cute-looking guy?

496
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,816
It's hard to tell
once you begin to like them.

497
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,735
You can't tell.

498
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,362
-Someone who tries hard.
-Yes.

499
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,325
-Are you with someone now?
-No.

500
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,826
So everyone is single?

501
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,953
Everyone is single?

502
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,039
Everyone is single.

503
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,331
And what are you into?

504
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,541
Tall people.

505
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,626
-Oh, really?
-Tall people?

506
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,421
Right, you are tall.

507
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,713
That's right.

508
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,966
Do baseball players tend to be tall?

509
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,593
-It depends on their position.
-Right.

510
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,221
Did we ask you what position you play?

511
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,140
-Pitcher.
-Yes, pitcher.

512
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,227
-You got stitches?
-My elbow.

513
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,478
Surgery?

514
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,813
It won't extend.

515
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,231
What?

516
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,358
-Is that baseball elbow?
-Yup.

517
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,818
You know your stuff.

518
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,654
-Oh, it stays like that.
-It won't extend.

519
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,531
-What?
-That's crazy.

520
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,284
Wait, you haven't told us, right?

521
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,370
You haven't told us yet
what your type is.

522
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,122
As for appearances...

523
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,542
cute...

524
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,587
is my type.

525
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,006
-I could see that.
-It's not very interesting, is it?

526
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,217
-What? No, it is.
-Everyone's started eating now.

527
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,469
Everyone started eating.

528
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,179
I lost interest in talking.

529
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,182
Everyone put their hands out
at the same time.

530
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,104
So they're already talking
about what type they're into.

531
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,605
-Yes.
-So...

532
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,774
He's a hair stylist
and has many qualities.

533
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,652
You would think he would be popular,
but it's not the case.

534
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:09,323
Unfortunately, Tatsuya has a high voice.

535
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,494
He has the tendency to get picked on.

536
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,287
How do you see them?

537
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,000
I think Tatsuya is...
The medical student, was it Minori?

538
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,626
-Yuriko.
-Yes, Yuriko.

539
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,169
I think he's into her.

540
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,171
-Really?
-Right, he keeps at it.

541
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,631
I guess he can tell.

542
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,591
I think in the near future...

543
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,301
Hasegawa...

544
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,969
Makocchan?

545
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,223
...seems interested in Yuriko.

546
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:39,020
But the barista,
because she works in the field of sports,

547
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,687
-is into Hasegawa.
-Right.

548
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:47,319
But the barista isn't the type
that reveals her interests easily.

549
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,071
So, even if she likes him,
she won't say it.

550
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,407
Like they've got this common sport thing

551
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,119
and she has this attraction
as a team assistant or something.

552
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,703
-Right.
-A-ha!

553
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,372
But won't say how she's feeling.

554
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,791
Although Makoto
is checking out Yuriko now,

555
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,334
it will eventually happen.

556
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,421
Your prediction is amazing!

557
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,880
Well, I want that to happen.

558
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,218
He seemed kind of happy
that she knew what his injury was.

559
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,929
-Baseball elbow, right?
-She did know it well.

560
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,681
It's also attractive.

561
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,683
I think they'll get closer
by being friends.

562
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,060
-Yes, that's right.
-Right?

563
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,727
-Like, through a mutual connection.
-Oh!

564
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,146
It's like he'll go for Yuriko,

565
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,482
but realize,
"The barista was always by my side."

566
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,819
Can you stop referring to her by her job?

567
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,239
-There's one thing that concerns me.
-Right.

568
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,866
Yuriko keeps saying she's hungry.

569
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,994
-That girl's probably selfish.
-That girl?

570
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,247
Has she already been caught
on your radar?

571
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,832
Yes, selfish.

572
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,127
You know, it's a new season,
but it's already quite fun.

573
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,671
Yes, it's been fun
since the very beginning.

574
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,131
The last group made such an impression,

575
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,507
I thought it would be difficult to match,

576
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,259
yet this group is beginning
to distinguish itself.

577
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,010
-Really.
-I am already thinking

578
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,846
that the previous group is history.

579
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,474
Well, maybe.

580
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,272
{\an8}It's buried somewhere.

581
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,316
You've got a lot of things there.

582
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,694
Yeah, I just couldn't decide what to take.

583
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:14,030
I put a bunch of things in,
but I'm still missing something.

584
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,074
-Your shoes!
-What?

585
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,370
-Those shoes.
-Sloppy? It shows my personality, right?

586
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,665
Tatsuya was pretty determined.

587
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,335
Yeah, I thought things
would be a little gentler.

588
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,381
"Well, that is why I came here."

589
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,133
-I wonder if that's true.
-He's so open.

590
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,009
He is really open.

591
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,763
Everyone is so easy to talk to.

592
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,723
I thought people would be
more eccentric here.

593
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,517
What do you mean, "eccentric"?

594
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,021
I wonder what they're thinking
over on their side.

595
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,360
-I'm sure they're talking about us.
-Yeah.

596
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,237
Cute.

597
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,697
She's cute.

598
00:26:55,781 --> 00:27:00,661
Before we arrived, I was more concerned
about the dynamics with the guys...

599
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,793
that I was going to share the room with
than the girls.

600
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,629
It doesn't seem like
we need to worry about that.

601
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,047
Yeah.

602
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,715
I am so glad.

603
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,467
So she's cute?

604
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,760
She's cute.

605
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,264
Well, it was mentioned a lot.

606
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,184
Like, you're into this girl.

607
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,102
It would be Mizuki.

608
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,148
Right, Mizuki.

609
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,567
-Like, the mature woman.
-The mature woman.

610
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,944
-Whoa.
-The mature woman.

611
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,698
You were hammering questions
at Yuriko, though.

612
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,741
I thought it was obvious.

613
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,328
-Didn't you think so?
-Yes, I did.

614
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,745
Right?

615
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,665
Well, we start from here.

616
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,083
-From here.
-From here.
