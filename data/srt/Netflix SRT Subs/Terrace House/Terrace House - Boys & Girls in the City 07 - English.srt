1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,431
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,184
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show
about six strangers, men and women

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,769
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,605
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,107
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared</i>
<i>is a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,901
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,654
{\an8}In the last episode,

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,907
{\an8}Tatsuya and Mizuki had a date at Odaiba.

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,742
{\an8}It was a good date.

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,286
{\an8}-It was a good date.
-Good date.

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,121
{\an8}Next will be my turn.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,456
{\an8}-Okay.
-I'll think of something.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,124
{\an8}I look forward to it.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,626
{\an8}I'm so sorry about that.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,045
{\an8}Oh, I'm so sorry, too.

16
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,630
{\an8}-This isn't good.
-It's not good.

17
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,715
{\an8}CLOSED FOR TODAY
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN

18
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,008
{\an8}This feels really new to me.

19
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,259
{\an8}New?

20
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,680
{\an8}I've never been out for dinner
with someone dressed so beautifully.

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,014
It took a lot of effort.

22
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,265
-You did?
-I did.

23
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,185
-Why?
-It's not like it was Yuriko's fault.

24
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,354
I think it was the way I approached her.

25
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,939
Among other things.

26
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,776
So Tatsuya regrets that it didn't go well
because he had to put in a lot of effort.

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,861
-Right.
-Right.

28
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,572
And what happened behind his back
was shocking.

29
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,575
Makoto's tattling and the LINE incident.

30
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,909
That's right.

31
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:21,456
His date with you was carefree and fun.

32
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:26,419
But it seemed he was
quite tense on our date.

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,298
Uchi told him something like that.

34
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,927
So, I heard that from Makocchan.

35
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,805
After that, Makocchan texted me,

36
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,851
something like,
"I don't want to see you sad."

37
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,144
I kinda forgot.

38
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>So awkward.</i>

39
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,024
What we don't know is

40
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,403
whether Makocchan is stupid,
or in fact a truly malicious schemer.

41
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,530
That hasn't become clear yet.

42
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,199
What did you think of
the whole turn of events?

43
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,536
I thought Makoto was such a coward.

44
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,290
-You said it.
-I told you.

45
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,708
I told you so.

46
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,460
-Acting with seniority.
-Showing seniority to him.

47
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,881
You said you were rooting for Makoto,
didn't you?

48
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,507
-Yes.
-That's the real him.

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,011
Don't get so puffed up.

50
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,179
Sorry.

51
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,682
Everyone makes mistakes.

52
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,975
You don't look that cool.

53
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,327
Uchi, are you up yet?

54
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,133
-Morning.
-Morning.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,142
Already ready?

56
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,604
Well, there's something...

57
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,900
I need to talk to you about.

58
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,987
I've been thinking about it.

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,490
Telling you...

60
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,035
what Makocchan told me

61
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,287
doesn't feel right, but...

62
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,042
You told him you could have
a fun date with Mizuki

63
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,005
without any effort,

64
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,133
but that you had to be cautious

65
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,512
a great deal during the date with me...

66
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,849
is what I heard.
And it made me feel pretty down.

67
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,936
Well, it's true, I was really cautious.

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,773
I'm just being honest.

69
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,690
But...

70
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:56,236
it wasn't your fault.
It was me.

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,366
I couldn't find the best way
to get to know you.

72
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,996
I was thinking of using
a different approach next time.

73
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,957
If that's the case,

74
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,294
I understand completely.

75
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,339
Makocchan shouldn't have told you that.

76
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,968
But I thought
I had to have a talk with you.

77
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,346
So I went to the boys' room,
but Makocchan was there.

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,349
I wonder what was on his mind.

79
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,813
So I wanted to explain to you

80
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,148
and apologize about yesterday.

81
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,150
-That's why you're here.
-Yeah.

82
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,652
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, no.

83
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm sorry, too.

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,952
Shall we go out, then?
I'll get ready.

85
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,163
I'm glad we talked.

86
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,433
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR AT MEIJI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

87
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,353
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

92
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,667
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,839
{\an8}-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

94
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,844
{\an8}Everyone tells me
that female doctors can't get married.

95
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,138
Why?

96
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,348
First, they're too busy to meet anyone.

97
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,433
Same with hairstylists.

98
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,436
You aren't allowed to ask
customers out, right?

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,564
Not that we aren't allowed,
but I won't date customers.

100
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,109
And we work long hours.

101
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,528
Plus, our days off are irregular.

102
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,739
So we tend to date within the profession.

103
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,787
How many girlfriends have you had?

104
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,584
Not many.

105
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,753
What? You can't...

106
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,505
-More than you can count?
-Not that many.

107
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,881
Four or five.

108
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,675
Me too. Five.

109
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,593
The first relationship was long.

110
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,722
My first girlfriend was
when I was a freshman in high school.

111
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,849
We went out for four years.

112
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,602
-That's long!
-It was crazy.

113
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,729
I erased all the other girls' addresses.

114
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,606
-Co-ed?
-Yeah.

115
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,360
We saw each other between classes.

116
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,030
-Wow.
-I walked her home every day after school.

117
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,781
I thought that was normal.

118
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,992
-She was my first girlfriend.
-I see.

119
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,994
"This is what dating is like."

120
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,871
Since you're popular with girls,

121
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,417
I thought you went through them quickly.

122
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,045
But you're not like that.

123
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,421
-The first...
-I feel bad.

124
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,716
It was fun talking about your love life.

125
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,179
Well, I wanted to talk about it.

126
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,390
The day before yesterday,
all I did was listen.

127
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,227
You got me.

128
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,064
Are you coming home late?

129
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,526
I finish around 8:00 p.m.,
so I'll be home around 9:30 p.m.

130
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,945
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

131
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,030
Let's go.

132
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,963
-Yo.
-Hey.

133
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,635
-Sit down.
-What?

134
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,802
Come sit.

135
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,975
I think I know what this is about.

136
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,518
That wasn't cool.

137
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,486
I wanna know what you were thinking
when you told Yuriko.

138
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,988
Well, what I said...

139
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,115
I don't blame Yuriko, but--

140
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,076
I heard that Yuriko asked you.

141
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,161
So...

142
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,458
I feel this is like a boy's club,

143
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,835
so I'm being frank.

144
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,088
So, if someone tattles...

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,258
I just think it's not right.

146
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,552
But,

147
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,388
it was the first date for you two.

148
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,391
It's normal to feel tense.

149
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,226
But it was thoughtless of you.

150
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,480
If I were Yuriko,
I'd also get upset...

151
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,777
if I heard that someone had to be
cautious around me.

152
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,323
But is it such a bad thing
to put in effort for someone?

153
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:57,245
She had also heard
that the date with Mizuki had been fun.

154
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,832
You told her that I hadn't needed
to put in any effort with Mizuki,

155
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,251
but that I had with her.

156
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,465
She thought that I compared them
and found her more difficult...

157
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,134
It'd hurt to know, wouldn't it?

158
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,139
Well,

159
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,352
I'll get angry next time. Really.
I may kick your butt.

160
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,064
I'll be careful.

161
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,857
Well...

162
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
Don't be so serious.

163
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,278
-I have to.
-No need.

164
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,991
Mizuki woke me up late last night
and told me--

165
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,201
Well, that's...

166
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,620
It's important to be told clearly once...

167
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,037
Man...

168
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,791
Yuriko was pretty hurt.

169
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,297
Mizuki told me to apologize to you two.

170
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,424
Yeah, I want an apology from you.

171
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,888
Do I need to apologize to Yuriko?

172
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,725
You need to talk with her about that.
I don't know.

173
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,444
You should think about how others may feel
before you say or do something.

174
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,413
-Okay.
-Well...

175
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,331
I got it.

176
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,501
I'm gonna hit the showers.

177
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,691
I'm starting to feel sorry for
the hairstylist that I've been loathing.

178
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,360
It wouldn't be easy to speak up, either.

179
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,737
He didn't want to, but he had to,
so he said it,

180
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,031
and that was the reaction he got.

181
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:01,077
Yeah, and the expression on his face said,
"I'm really repressing my anger."

182
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,120
That twitch between his eyebrows.

183
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,708
-That reaction is hard to take.
-It's too much.

184
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,126
I don't think it's because he's stupid.

185
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,214
-What is it?
-Is he simply a jerk?

186
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,507
Perhaps he lacks empathy.

187
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,133
He might have meant well,

188
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,511
but if someone doesn't like it,
it's wrong.

189
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,679
I agree.

190
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,889
So he needs to realize
that he owes apologies.

191
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,266
Exactly.

192
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,393
-You're so right.
-What's bad is bad.

193
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,186
It may have felt right to him.

194
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,646
You sound like a bossy mom.

195
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,733
If someone says it's wrong, it's wrong.

196
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,443
Even if you think it's right.

197
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,571
-Big mama.
-Big mama.

198
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,698
There was a political candidate like you.

199
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,743
-What's bad is bad.
-Bad is bad.

200
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,953
"I will fix this city. So vote for me."

201
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,124
What made me think he's a jerk

202
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,003
is when he said,
"I don't want to blame Yuriko, but..."

203
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,713
What's obvious here is,

204
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,133
even though he says
it's his fault and not hers,

205
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,595
what he really wants people to hear
is that it was Yuri's fault.

206
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,474
That kind of tactic is something
only a jerk would use.

207
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,643
I know it because I'm a jerk myself.

208
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,479
-You use that method?
-You're a jerk too?

209
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,440
I do. I use it when
I don't wanna admit something

210
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,443
or when I'm dissatisfied with something.

211
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,362
So he's a jerk just like me.

212
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,532
-Same jerk?
-Same jerk.

213
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,784
Not all athletes are innocent.

214
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,495
I'm certain he's even worse.
How exciting!

215
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,080
-You want more juicy stuff.
-I want more.

216
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,582
This is not the end of it.

217
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,751
You can squeeze out more good stuff.

218
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,336
Squeeze out good stuff...

219
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,547
-More good stuff?
-Much more.

220
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,677
{\an8}TAKESHIBA FERRY TERMINAL

221
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,263
{\an8}Welcome aboard.

222
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,100
{\an8}-Here you are.
-Thank you.

223
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,769
{\an8}We made it.

224
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,068
{\an8}-Nice.
-This is great.

225
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,700
First date?

226
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,951
-Huh?
-Your first date?

227
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,537
Do you consider running together a date?

228
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,121
-Yes, I do.
-You do?

229
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,082
-Then this is my second.
-Okay, second.

230
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,545
Did you two reconcile?

231
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,923
Reconcile?
We weren't on bad terms.

232
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,092
We weren't fighting or anything.

233
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,386
My impression of Makocchan changed a lot.

234
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,637
What? How?

235
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,348
-Huh?
-How did it change?

236
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,684
I thought he was calm and collected.

237
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,812
-He isn't?
-He isn't. Not at all.

238
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,772
He's revealed his true colors.

239
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,400
What will he do now?

240
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,152
{\an8}IZU OSHIMA

241
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,780
{\an8}-There it is.
-I wanna fish.

242
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,282
Wow! Amazing.
The ocean.

243
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,581
-Gorgeous!
-Gorgeous!

244
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,876
Amazing view.

245
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,587
Have a good day.

246
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,589
-Amazing.
-Amazing.

247
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,300
{\an8}We're off to Izu Oshima! Uchi & Minori
I'm off to a lesson in Sendai!! Yuki

248
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,893
So cold!

249
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,187
How come nobody's here?

250
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,779
{\an8}-We can't catch anything.
-Nothing at all.

251
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,580
-The end.
-No. One more chance.

252
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,668
Too close.

253
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,589
What? What?

254
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,883
-You've got something. Pull!
-Help me pull!

255
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,679
It's coming!
It's coming!

256
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,222
On the very last one?

257
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,476
You did it!

258
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,106
-We got it.
-We got it. One fish.

259
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,236
Wow, what a smell!

260
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,405
Cows.

261
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,535
-They are gobbling.
-Amazing.

262
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,870
I hope they'll come near.

263
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:13,996
Cows!

264
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,124
You like them?

265
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,586
-I hear you want to work at a ranch.
-Yeah.

266
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,215
{\an8}-To take care of them?
-I want to.

267
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,633
-Cows?
-Yeah.

268
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,012
Cows.

269
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,224
Cows.

270
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,267
Cows!

271
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,313
CAMELLIAS - SOCIAL AREA - RECREATION AREA

272
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,399
Let's eat the lunch that you made.

273
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,653
-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit!

274
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,282
-Good?
-Good. Delicious.

275
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,076
Very picnic-like.

276
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,746
You're a good cook.

277
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,874
-You noticed?
-I noticed.

278
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,335
This is very nice. This...

279
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,421
Nature surrounding us.

280
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,715
Feels date-like?

281
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,009
The most date-like date so far.

282
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,053
Out of the three,
this is the most date-like.

283
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,598
Did your impression of Mizuki change
after the date?

284
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,849
It did.

285
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,309
Did she become a girl?

286
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,228
Did she become a girl?

287
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,732
-She is a girl.
-So am I.

288
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,652
You're more like a little brother.

289
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,531
In my eyes, you're my little brother.

290
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,366
-Why not a little sister?
-You're boyish.

291
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,869
But you're the most comfortable one
to be with.

292
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,622
-I'm probably the most comfortable type.
-You are.

293
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,583
-What?
-What?

294
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,084
-It makes me happy.
-Does it?

295
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,513
{\an8}How was the Uchi Week?

296
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,807
A lot happened.

297
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,184
I heard bits and pieces from people.

298
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,351
What happened? What--

299
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,271
Something else happened
between Makocchan and me.

300
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,273
What? A fistfight?

301
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,528
I made a negative comment about
how I had to cater to someone.

302
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,031
But it's not something
the person needs to know about.

303
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,241
But it's not something to hide, either.

304
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,118
Did you try to hide it?

305
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,079
Not necessarily hide it,

306
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,165
but there are things a person should know

307
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,335
and things you don't want them to know.

308
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:28,505
Earlier, we all talked about
how we should share our thoughts

309
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,133
about who likes or dislikes whom,
about which girl we're into or not into.

310
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,971
But if it's just going to leak out,
I'm not going to share my thoughts.

311
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,015
If you don't want to share,
you don't need to.

312
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,394
What was that sneer?

313
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,606
-Huh?
-What was that sneer?

314
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,149
I won't share anything then.

315
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,328
{\an8}OSHIAGE, TOKYO

316
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,013
There you are.

317
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,683
-How are you?
-Sorry for making you wait.

318
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,059
{\an8}All right, let's go.

319
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,354
It's huge.

320
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,443
Amazing.

321
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,572
-Beautiful.
-Yeah.

322
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,577
It'd be nice to have this
on the wall of my house.

323
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,916
Even <i>Terrace House</i>
couldn't put this on the wall.

324
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,292
They sure couldn't.

325
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,671
They're all looking in the same direction.

326
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,631
At the perfect angle.

327
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,843
I wonder what they're looking at.

328
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,680
I feel the strong determination.

329
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,265
-They look like you.
-Why?

330
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,060
Seems like they're looking
straight into the future.

331
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,228
There. There they are.

332
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,774
Tonight's highlight is garden eels!

333
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,194
Amazing!
I've never seen such long ones.

334
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,529
What does the color difference mean?

335
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:19,158
These are splendid garden eels
and these are spotted garden eels.

336
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,995
I wonder how they breed.

337
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,456
Maybe they do things under the sand.

338
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,792
Under the sand?
You're nasty!

339
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,590
{\an8}ASAKUSA, TOKYO

340
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,842
{\an8}BENTEN

341
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,593
{\an8}OKONOMIYAKI MONJA

342
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,553
{\an8}-Thank you so much.
-For what?

343
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,764
{\an8}-The aquarium.
-You're very welcome.

344
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,141
{\an8}-I had a lot of fun.
-Spotted garden eels.

345
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,518
Yeah, but I liked the penguins.

346
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,313
But that wasn't the highlight.

347
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,815
You wanna have them cook it?

348
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,275
Let's cook it ourselves.

349
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,320
-It already looks delicious.
-Does it?

350
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,280
I'll definitely spill it.

351
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,074
We'll make it work.

352
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,035
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

353
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:08,124
Have you danced since the last tap event?

354
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,126
After watching that event,

355
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,586
I understood why, on your birthday,

356
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,172
you talked so passionately.

357
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,050
Really? Well, I did make you cry...

358
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,594
But now I really understand.

359
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,597
I heard Uchi was going to take you
to an aquarium,

360
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,767
so I thought,
"That'll overlap with my plan!"

361
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,059
You said you liked jazz,

362
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,311
so I thought maybe Blue Note, then...

363
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,314
I love Blue Note!
But isn't that place expensive?

364
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,191
One of the staff...

365
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,069
I know a guy who works as the bartender.

366
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,364
I talked with him,
and he gave me a schedule.

367
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,698
-Really?
-Yeah.

368
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,785
I love Blue Note so much!

369
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,202
It's nice, isn't it?

370
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,246
Do you dance there too?

371
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,957
It's one of my goals.

372
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,503
If you perform at Blue Note,
you'll be unapproachable.

373
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,548
-Not at all.
-No?

374
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,929
I want to go to Blue Note.

375
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,305
What? Blue Note?

376
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,639
Let's go.

377
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,183
You mean it?

378
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,267
Let's go.

379
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,816
{\an8}OMOTESANDO, TOKYO

380
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,239
Thank you very much.

381
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,758
-Hi.
-Hi.

382
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,637
-Sorry for the unexpected visit.
-No problem.

383
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
{\an8}-Can we talk now?
-Welcome.

384
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,809
{\an8}You look cool.

385
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,103
{\an8}What would you like?

386
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,396
-Hazelnut.
-Hazelnut. Okay.

387
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,112
Cute!

388
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,030
-So amazing!
-Here you are.

389
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,033
Thank you.

390
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,702
-Looks good.
-It's best when it's fresh.

391
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,374
Tasty.

392
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,960
What brought you here?

393
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,086
Huh?

394
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,715
I haven't checked out
everyone's workplace, so...

395
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,175
We saw Yuki's.

396
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,343
Right.

397
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,595
Yuki looked so cool.

398
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,265
I thought of going
to Makocchan's place, too.

399
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,308
-Makocchan?
-The practice field.

400
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,476
Right.

401
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,978
Let's go together.

402
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,312
-I'll go.
-Yeah.

403
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,564
We can invite Minori, too.

404
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,609
Minori...

405
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,819
What?

406
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,157
I just wondered about her.

407
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,409
Remember, at first,

408
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,412
-all of us liked Makocchan?
-We did.

409
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,788
The other day,

410
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,625
I brought trouble to you and Uchi.

411
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,504
I thought my feelings might change
after that incident.

412
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,881
-Toward Makocchan?
-Yeah, yeah.

413
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,633
But they didn't change.

414
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,469
-I see.
-They didn't.

415
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,139
I don't know how to put this.

416
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,101
-He's still...
-I know you don't dislike him.

417
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,062
He's still at the top.

418
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,354
-The top?
-The top.

419
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,023
Seriously?

420
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,816
But...

421
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,778
If Minori has feelings for him too,

422
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,990
and if I go to him knowing that...

423
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,493
I can't, after all this.

424
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,706
After everything that's happened,
asking him out

425
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,084
seems so odd.

426
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:43,047
You heard Minori might like him,
so you can't make a move.

427
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,215
I understand.

428
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:48,177
But if you think you like him,

429
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,472
pretending that you don't
seems like a shame.

430
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,019
Thank you.
I'll take it here.

431
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,937
Thank you so much.

432
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,151
-Why?
-Why?

433
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,902
-Why?
-What does she like about him?

434
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,280
-Wait a minute.
-I don't get it.

435
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,449
Shall we try figuring it out one by one?

436
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,745
But I like what Minori said.

437
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,248
Makoto "revealed his true colors."

438
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,460
-That's something we'd say.
-Right.

439
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,714
She must be really disgusted with
his saying something like that.

440
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,549
Since she liked him at first...

441
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,262
He looked calm and collected,
but in reality he's just a child.

442
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:35,099
{\an8}If Makoto started singing a song
with a guitar, he would be that guy.

443
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,725
{\an8}YOSUKE IMAI (30)
JULY 2013 - MARCH 2014

444
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,104
{\an8}-That guy. Once again.
-It'd be bad.

445
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,149
That conversation in the boys' room...

446
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,443
-"Then you don't have to."
-You can't say that.

447
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,819
That was bad!

448
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,945
The worst thing to say.

449
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,823
It would make anyone say,
"Then I'll stop sharing things with you."

450
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,200
I could see that coming.

451
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,952
"Okay, then.
You don't have to say anything."

452
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,747
Sounds like an ugly girlfriend.

453
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,250
-Indeed.
-But, at that moment,

454
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,420
Tap should've said something.

455
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,839
If it's not about dreams and stuff,
he's like...

456
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,175
Is that so?

457
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,801
"I don't know."

458
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,637
"I don't care what happened in the past."

459
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,972
But Yuriko still likes him.

460
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,808
-Why?
-Why?

461
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,851
She says Makoto's still at the top.

462
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,480
But she went to the aquarium with Tap
and ate monja.

463
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,940
I don't get that either.

464
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,901
And Blue Note?

465
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,321
She whispers that she wants to go.

466
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,239
"I wanna go to Blue note."

467
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,658
It's amazing she could do such a thing.

468
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,618
She must really want to go.

469
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,080
That must be the reason.

470
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,124
-She really wants to go to Blue Note.
-She does.

471
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,419
But in that situation, guys would think,
"She wants to go with me."

472
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,753
We would.

473
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,130
-They would.
-We would.

474
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,257
She could've used a normal voice.

475
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,301
The first word was very crass.

476
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,760
-Remember?
-What?

477
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,762
-She said "expensive."
-Right.

478
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,931
-"Isn't it expensive?"
-She said that.

479
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,685
I thought, "Oh man, she's good."

480
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,732
She has probably wanted to go
for a long time, but it was too expensive.

481
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,693
That's not a juicy part.

482
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,320
I drooled.

483
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,946
Thinking she's a schemer, too.

484
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,531
So juicy, you thought.

485
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,951
What's so attractive about Makoto?

486
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,037
She hasn't seen
that disagreeable scene yet.

487
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,583
She only knows that she told on him.

488
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,293
Right. She hasn't seen that.

489
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,338
Plus, she's got a LINE message,
"I don't want to see you sad."

490
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,464
That's true.

491
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,091
She doesn't know his true colors yet.

492
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,386
She doesn't know his retort yet.

493
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,930
What do you think, Ayumu,
about Makocchan,

494
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,308
who you were rooting for in the beginning?

495
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,393
What do you say?

496
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,437
I'm being influenced by your opinion.

497
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,275
Good boy.
Is that so?

498
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,277
It's a comfortable place, isn't it?

499
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,298
What are you watching?

500
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,967
The previous season of <i>Terrace House.</i>

501
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,219
Can we...

502
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,096
talk downstairs?

503
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,933
-What?
-Let's talk.

504
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,060
Is the playroom okay?

505
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,270
Okay.

506
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,525
Sorry.

507
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,985
So people won't hear us.

508
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,280
What is this?

509
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,949
What's the matter?

510
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,453
Well...

511
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,164
Since the other day,

512
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,210
I've been feeling a little confused.

513
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,504
I'd been thinking...

514
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,717
I liked Minori a lot at first.

515
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,848
My feelings then, and my feelings now,
are completely different.

516
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,975
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

517
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,770
The reason is,
there was the Uchi Week, right?

518
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:14,235
He announced that he was gonna have
a date with each of you.

519
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:19,155
He said he wanted to observe each of you

520
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,158
when he was alone with you.

521
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,786
Back then, I thought it was okay...

522
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,415
I accepted the situation.

523
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,000
But later,

524
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,046
I felt that it was wrong.

525
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,758
How can girls,

526
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,676
without thinking too deeply,

527
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,346
go out with him after that?

528
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,765
I couldn't understand it.

529
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,602
Minori and I were pretty close,

530
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,855
and I think she knew how I felt.

531
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,735
But I saw her making lunch for the date.

532
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,738
That kind of thing

533
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,409
made me lose interest in her.

534
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,620
I honestly thought it was weird, too.

535
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,914
But Uchi said

536
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,668
that he wanted to get to know
each of us individually

537
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,629
and see how the relationships play out.

538
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,465
I was like,
"So that's what he was thinking."

539
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:22,344
-So I understood it.
-You understood it?

540
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,596
Minori gets along well with Uchi,

541
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,349
and Minori said,

542
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,270
"I don't think Uchi thinks that way."

543
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,563
Something like that.

544
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,357
So I thought if Minori said so,
it must be true.

545
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,651
After I heard that,

546
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,696
I thought maybe I was overreacting.

547
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,493
And so, now,

548
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,332
I have no feelings for her.
I liked her at first, but...

549
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,542
Nothing.
How do I put this?

550
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,044
But, Makocchan,

551
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,672
I thought you liked Minori, so I'm...

552
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,301
-Really?
-Yeah.

553
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:05,220
Well, I did, but...

554
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,472
I did...

555
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,765
I see...
