1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,892
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,519
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,271
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,985
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:31,156
Last week, Minori and Uchi...

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,702
-left the house.
-That's right.

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,662
<i>It was a tearful goodbye.</i>

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,664
<i>It finally felt like</i>
<i>everyone was under one roof.</i>

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,125
<i>Some warmth was finally back</i>
<i>at</i> Terrace House.

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,503
This was all thanks to the meat incident.

13
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,004
That's true.

14
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,966
Meat can do so many things.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,926
It's not just delicious.

16
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,972
And if they left, that means...

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,726
-Misaki's arrival.
-That's right. Tamosan is here.

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,770
-I'm sorry, what was your name again?
-I'm Misaki Tamori.

19
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,105
-Misaki?
-Misaki.

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,858
My friends call me Tamochan or Tamosan.

21
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,942
Tamosan?

22
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,944
-Super cute?
-Yeah?

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,112
Your type?

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,197
-She's pretty high energy.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,699
I love that.

26
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,077
Dreams for the future?
We haven't asked that yet.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
An amusement park.

28
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,287
-To build one?
-Yes.

29
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,208
-An amusement park of everyone's dreams.
-That's right!

30
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,003
<i>-A pretty girl.</i>
<i>-Yes, very beautiful.</i>

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,673
-Her dream is to build an amusement park.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,967
Didn't you know someone like that
as a kid?

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,345
"When I build it,
I'll do your store, too!"

34
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,765
It's a little strange to say
after you turn 20, though.

35
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:39,642
That's right.

36
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,185
-The new guy is coming today.
-Yes, that's right!

37
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,479
-He seems mature.
-Very mature.

38
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,482
I'm very interested to see
what he looks like.

39
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,318
What made you decide?

40
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,655
I'm graduating...

41
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,573
I figured it'd be a good change of pace.

42
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,117
-Seems like the smart type.
-Yes.

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,662
-That's what's nice.
-I want to see his face.

44
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,665
-I want to see his face. Let's watch.
-Shall we watch?

45
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,550
I'm really nervous for some reason.

46
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,760
Maybe because it's so sudden.

47
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,305
-Wow.
-What do you mean, "Wow"?

48
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,058
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,267
I'm Handa.

50
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,520
It's nice to meet you.

51
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,772
-Kanda?
-Kanda.

52
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,482
What was your name again?

53
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,943
-Handa.
-Oh, Handa.

54
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,321
-I'm Yuto Handa. It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,949
-What do you do?
-How old are you?

56
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,243
I'm currently still in university...

57
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,747
-You're a student?
-I'm graduating in March.

58
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,542
I major in architecture
at Tokyo University of the Arts.

59
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,505
I'm studying architecture.
I'm 27, trying to become an architect.

60
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,216
-He's older!
-He's older!

61
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,927
-You seem happy.
-You're super happy.

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,638
If you study architecture,
do you also design?

63
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,473
-Yes.
-Design?

64
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,642
Mainly designing and drafting, too.

65
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:10,232
I've been taking outside projects
such as renovating and designing cafés.

66
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,193
I'll continue to do it
and work independently.

67
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,778
With tools.

68
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,072
-You do it all yourself?
-I do.

69
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,657
-Wow.
-Not the best results.

70
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,660
-Oh, then he can make my amusement park.
-Amusement park?

71
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,746
-It's her dream.
-She wants you to design it.

72
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,040
Design an amusement park?
Sounds difficult.

73
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,002
-The dream is big.
-The dream is huge.

74
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,004
Why did you come to <i>Terrace House?</i>

75
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,590
I'm graduating,
but I don't plan on looking for a job.

76
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:39,011
I plan to spend this year preparing
to study abroad.

77
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,765
Is there a specific school in mind?
A school you're hoping to get into?

78
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:46,977
I'm aiming for Harvard in Boston.

79
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,312
-That's my first choice.
-Harvard?

80
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,439
-Harvard Architecture? That's impressive.
-Wow.

81
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:56,194
Yes, if I can get in.
Otherwise, maybe Columbia.

82
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,240
-You must be really smart.
-Not at all.

83
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,577
What do you need to do to get in?
Know English?

84
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:08,916
English, a portfolio of my work,
and an interview.

85
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,375
What about studying?

86
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,170
I do have to study a little.

87
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,547
A little bit.

88
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,465
So you finished school,
but you want to go back?

89
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,843
Yes. Graduate school.

90
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,386
-Wow.
-For a master's degree.

91
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,681
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-I do.

92
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,390
-You do?
-Yes.

93
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,518
-Where? I mean, not where...
-Where?

94
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,813
How long have you been together?

95
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,524
-A little over two years.
-Oh, a long time.

96
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,275
How old is she?

97
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,612
She's turning... 23, I think.

98
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,615
-She didn't oppose to your moving here?
-That's right.

99
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,538
She did a little bit,
but she sent me off in good spirits.

100
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,497
-Do you drink?
-What?

101
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,875
-Do you drink?
-Yes, I do.

102
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,085
That's good.

103
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,337
Would you like a drink now? No?

104
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,965
Sure. Is that okay?

105
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,594
-Have you had dinner yet?
-Only a little.

106
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,804
-There's curry.
-Curry?

107
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,181
Sure, I'd love some.

108
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,852
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

109
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,522
I'm gonna get water.

110
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,358
What do you think of...
Oh, you've only seen the living room.

111
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,276
-Yes.
-Me, too.

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,572
The exterior surprised me, though.
It's huge!

113
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,449
Right, this is right up your alley.
Are you looking around?

114
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,244
I'm planning on taking
a closer look at the details later.

115
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,704
Details? What details?

116
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,873
-Oh, the finer points around the--
-Here you go.

117
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,042
Thank you.
That's a big serving.

118
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,210
Is it?

119
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm used to serving Hikaru.
I thought maybe that's not enough.

120
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,757
I can totally eat.

121
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,091
-Can I go ahead?
-Of course.

122
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,175
Thank you.

123
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,305
It's delicious.

124
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,349
Do you like to keep things clean?

125
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,893
-Nope.
-Not at all?

126
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,227
I'm super messy.

127
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,646
Super messy?

128
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,857
So besides Natsumi,
does anyone else keep clean?

129
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,234
She just came in,
so I don't know how bad she is.

130
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,445
-I think it's pretty bad.
-You seem like you'd be messy.

131
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,241
Maybe that was rude.

132
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,952
Of course I'll keep clean, though.
It's a co-op after all.

133
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,914
Yay! I'm glad.
Let's do it together.

134
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,957
How long have you been together
with your girlfriend?

135
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,210
This is the second time you've asked,
but two and a half years.

136
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,423
He's so mature.

137
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,091
The way he answered that.

138
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,219
Two and a half years, huh?

139
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,098
It's that complicated point
in a relationship.

140
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,226
-That's your opinion.
-You said that earlier, too.

141
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,106
That's true.
It can be complicated.

142
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,983
-Especially during spring time.
-Right?

143
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,319
What do you mean, "Right"?

144
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,238
What are your plans tomorrow?

145
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,324
My friend just got married.

146
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:52,705
He asked me to build a table for him,
so I need to work on that.

147
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,790
Do you have tools with you?

148
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,000
-I have a lot.
-Really?

149
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,586
Where do you keep it?

150
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,589
I keep it at the studio.

151
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,298
-You have a studio?
-Yes.

152
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,217
Where is it?

153
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,302
We're asking so many questions.

154
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,012
Where is it?

155
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,641
Um, near Ueno.
Near the school.

156
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,568
He was nice enough
to pick up the trash here.

157
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,319
I thought maybe I dropped it.

158
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,489
Isn't that hardened leftover noodles?

159
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,700
-Hardened noodles?
-When is that from?

160
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,494
-I don't know.
-That's true. It's a little hard.

161
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,787
It's hard?

162
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:38,000
-I like that about him.
-He made your heart flutter?

163
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,168
I'll show you the rooms.

164
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,254
Can I put my luggage away?

165
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,047
-Me, too.
-That's right.

166
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,341
I'll wash this later.

167
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,385
You're so sweet!

168
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,763
-Well, I'm the one who ate it.
-I'm impressed.

169
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,098
Oh, thank you.

170
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,392
-Is this it?
-Yes, that's it.

171
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,019
I'll lead the way.

178
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,403
-Is that a traditional-style tattoo?
-Yeah.

179
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,030
-It's really cool.
-Thanks.

180
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,325
It had been just completed.
Added the color.

181
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,118
What are you working on right now?

182
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,581
My priority right now is the café project.

183
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,333
-The...
-You're doing the interior?

184
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,627
-The exterior.
-The exterior?

185
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,796
They asked for a more stylish exterior,

186
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,508
so that anyone would recognize it
as a café.

187
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,759
That was the request.

188
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,470
It's about 80% done.

189
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,807
It's really small, so it's quick.
Well, it was supposed to be.

190
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,976
But more requests came up.

191
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,896
So I'm just finishing some details.
Things like re-painting.

192
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,773
I'll be happy to help.

193
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,400
-There's a lot I need help with.
-Of course.

194
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,904
-I can help paint at least.
-Yeah, that'll be great!

195
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,866
Is there something you want
to accomplish at <i>Terrace House?</i>

196
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,620
I didn't come here with any clear goals.

197
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,288
I consider it an adventure.

198
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,457
I don't know what'll happen.

199
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,128
I just thought
something new would come out of it.

200
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:50,090
I don't think there are too many people
in co-ed living situations.

201
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,845
I thought it could be fun.
Not just as friends, you know?

202
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,516
-So you'd be mad if it was messy here.
-No.

203
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,935
This much is okay?
Of course, of course!

204
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:06,982
But leaving cups out all dried up...

205
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,567
That's not me.

206
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,819
No, I think it's you.

207
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,198
It's your first day,
but I feel so comfortable with you.

208
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,283
Yeah?

209
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,038
Probably because you girls are so nice.

210
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,915
-Yeah!
-I think that's why.

211
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,669
-What about the guys?
-The guys...

212
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,129
They're nice, too.

213
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,424
-But a little scary?
-Not scary--

214
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,427
-I feel like Hikaru might explode someday.
-That's true.

215
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,097
I didn't think
a guy would also come today.

216
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,473
Me neither.

217
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,976
-But he has a girlfriend.
-Oh, yeah.

218
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,728
I forgot.

219
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,897
-That's right.
-I was so surprised.

220
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,066
-It was a surprise.
-Wasn't it?

221
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,234
He seems really nice.

222
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,112
-He seems mature.
-But dirty.

223
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,448
-Dirty?
-No, that's not what I meant.

224
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:59,284
He said he didn't like to clean.

225
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,412
But when he picked up that trash...

226
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,123
-I'm sure he's a cleaner.
-Really?

227
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,001
-He was just being modest?
-Yeah, he knows how to be modest.

228
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,962
Hansan...

229
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,089
I wonder...

230
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,341
He's got a girlfriend, you know?

231
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,596
But you never know.

232
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,806
They might break up.
They'll probably break up.

233
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,725
They're probably gonna break up?

234
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,602
Well, I don't know, but...

235
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,021
It doesn't matter if he has a girlfriend.

236
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,941
If I fall for him, that is.

237
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,985
-Seriously?
-It doesn't matter at all.

238
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,114
Oh, man.
Mr. Perfect is here.

239
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,409
What? Is that the chat room opinion?

240
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,079
The voice of the chat rooms.

241
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,414
I can't believe Mr. Perfect is here.

242
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,753
-A real good one arrived.
-Yeah.

243
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,881
He's the type of guy
that's really popular.

244
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,509
-Yes, very popular.
-What do you think, ladies?

245
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,010
-He's hot.
-He's hot.

246
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,428
There you have it.

247
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,973
You can go to him for advice.

248
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,517
I want to go to him for advice!

249
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,934
Torichan!

250
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,980
-We've got a strong contender.
-You never know!

251
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,275
Don't be fooled by the way he talks.
He's not saying much.

252
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,819
He's just saying he's building a café.

253
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,071
It just sounds cool
because he's saying it all low-key.

254
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,115
Why are you talking so fast?

255
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,951
I have no idea what you just said.

256
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,453
It was just ugly.

257
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,957
It was ugly.
That speed was ugly.

258
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,086
It's nice that he's not aggressive.

259
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,381
Since it's likely
he won't make the first move,

260
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,384
-it makes you want to make the first move.
-What are you saying, Torichan?

261
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,512
-What are you saying?
-What was that?

262
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,638
He's got a girlfriend!

263
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,765
-He doesn't seem cold.
-Yes.

264
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,518
-That's right! And--
-Torichan!

265
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,979
Did you pee your pants?

266
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,190
You're too excited.

267
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,735
When he lightly said,
"This is the second time you asked."

268
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,903
-His light teasing.
-Yes, very light.

269
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,863
"This is the second time you asked,
but it's been two years."

270
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,239
I loved that.

271
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,450
If he had said it like
"This is the second time you asked!

272
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,243
The second time!"

273
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:09,081
-That would've been bad, right?
-That would just be chilling.

274
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,000
Even when he said
he wants to go to Harvard,

275
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,796
he didn't force all his plans on everyone.

276
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,758
He was asked, and he just answered,
"I'm thinking of Harvard."

277
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,426
-In a humble tone.
-That's right.

278
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,721
-That's what was different from Tap.
-Totally different.

279
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,347
YUKI ADACHI, TAP DANCER

280
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,641
Tap aggressively announced it.

281
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,643
Maybe he's got a really weird mole.

282
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,459
Actually, it'd be great if he had one.

283
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,316
-What if it looked like a face?
-"Oh, it's a mole. How nice!"

284
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,318
And then I'd feed the mole.

285
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,779
"Open wide!"

286
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,864
Wow.

287
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,326
Wait, this can't be happening.

288
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,330
I can't even bad mouth him.
He has no faults.

289
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,876
-No, he doesn't.
-Everything is just right.

290
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,379
But there have been many instances
in <i>Terrace House</i>

291
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,673
where there's sort of a bubble
on the first day.

292
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:00,924
Oh, the first day bubble?

293
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:05,596
-The bubble has burst in the past.
-I'll try not to have expectations.

294
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,848
Bubble, burst, please!

295
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,017
This might be the bubble that won't burst.

296
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,645
Well, bubbles always burst, you see.

297
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,814
-History has proven this.
-That's true.

298
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,358
Your upper lip is all sweaty.

299
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,279
Bubbles burst.
He's determined.

-Good morning.

304
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,181
I went for a run.

305
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,183
-You did?
-Yeah.

306
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,143
-Oh, Hansan.
-Hansan.

307
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,813
-Good morning.
-Morning. You look a little pale.

308
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,690
-Are you okay?
-I always look like this.

309
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,568
Are you okay?

310
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,653
-Low blood pressure?
-Yeah.

311
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,448
-You're studying English?
-Yeah, a vocabulary book.

312
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,869
It's been a long time.
I've forgotten everything.

313
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,957
Feel free to ask any questions,
or I can read that to you.

314
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,166
Great.

315
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,294
Okay.

316
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,509
I went for a run.

317
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,012
How healthy of her.

318
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,140
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

319
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,350
Excuse me.

320
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,476
Morning!

321
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,103
-Good morning.
-I'm back.

322
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,772
Welcome back.

323
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,316
Were you able to sleep?

324
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,026
-Totally.
-No way!

325
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,862
-What's your part-time job?
-My part-time job?

326
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,615
-I work at a convenience store.
-Really?

327
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,950
-Today?
-No, I'm off today.

328
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,869
You're going out?

329
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,413
Yeah, I was going
to pick up things I needed.

330
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,832
-That's a good idea.
-Wanna go?

331
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,291
I'm missing so many things I need.

332
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,962
-You're off today?
-I was going to do some work,

333
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,422
but I'm going to have drinks
with some friends in the evening.

334
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,509
-So shopping works, too.
-Oh!

335
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:09,553
Will you get some Gekiochi scrubbers?

336
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,346
-Oh, good idea.
-Nice!

337
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,516
Finally, someone who understands.

338
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,475
Yeah, the corners are a little dirty.

339
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,602
Yay!

340
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:21,356
You need to clean square off,
but not round at the corner of the floor.

341
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,694
If you guys have time,
I'd love to get some help.

342
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,239
-Doing what?
-I need to build some furniture.

343
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,324
-Totally!
-It sounds fun!

344
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,702
-Come to my studio.
-Sure. Where is it?

345
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,625
UENO, TOKYO

346
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,710
-Thank you for having me.
-Please, come in.

347
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,422
Thank you for having me.

348
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,007
It's a little messy.

349
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,301
-Thank you for having me.
-Oh, wow.

350
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,511
It's clean.

351
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,555
-Is it?
-Yeah.

352
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,222
It's not at its best.

353
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,725
Amazing.

354
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,435
-Feels like a studio.
-Right?

355
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,395
-Did you live here?
-Yeah.

356
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,479
It's stylish.

357
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:03,231
-It's so stylish!
-Yeah.

358
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,442
-It's so nice.
-Not at all.

359
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,986
-Thank you for having us.
-Of course.

360
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,363
You do your work here?

361
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,576
The messier projects I do over there.

362
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,244
I work mostly on my computer here.

363
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,455
-Wow.
-Or I draw out here.

364
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,374
Wouldn't this be great if you were a girl?

365
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,670
-What do you mean?
-Like, "Here's my studio."

366
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,673
-Yeah, it's cool.
-Right, it is cool.

367
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:31,384
-That's how he got the girl.
-Oh, is that your strategy?

368
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,054
Maybe that is how I got her.

369
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,432
-What do you want us to do today?
-Oh, right.

370
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,560
Today...

371
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,104
I'm making a table.

372
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,899
So I thought I'd have you paint.

373
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,362
-Sawing might be difficult.
-Yeah, forget about it.

374
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:55,450
So painting and sanding.
I'll lend you something to wear.

375
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,078
-So I'll have you change.
-Yay.

376
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,581
I hope we can be of help.

377
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,041
You can just cheer us on, Tamochan.

378
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,294
"Go, team, go!"

379
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,046
I could.

380
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,633
Got it.

381
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,267
Here it is.

382
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,144
It's a little cramped.

383
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,939
It's a little messy.

384
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,024
-Wow.
-Amazing.

385
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,568
-Here are the gloves.
-Okay.

386
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:30,861
For everyone.

387
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,239
-Thanks.
-I've never painted before.

388
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,658
-Oh, really?
-Me neither.

389
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,076
-Here I go!
-Please do.

390
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,705
When did you decide you wanted to do this?

391
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:46,334
-I've known since kindergarten.
-What inspired you?

392
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:50,422
I went to an unusual kindergarten
where we had to build a shack together.

393
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:54,176
So we all made a shack
to keep all the cleaning supplies.

394
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,678
A pretty big one.

395
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,639
-A real one?
-Yeah, we used saws.

396
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,016
-Oh, so that made you...
-Yes.

397
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,060
I realized how fun it was.

398
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,270
-That's amazing.
-So that never changed for you?

399
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,273
Well, I did give up on it once.

400
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,569
But I realized again
that this is what I want to do.

401
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,987
-So I re-applied to college.
-I see.

402
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,948
So you went to a normal college as well?

403
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,992
Yes, I graduated
and then went to the school of arts.

404
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,828
That's amazing.

405
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,080
Dust is gonna fly.

406
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,915
I'm scared!

407
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,879
Amazing!
The machine, yes.

408
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,256
-So cool!
-Yes, the machine is.

409
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,675
Amazing.

410
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,678
I can't picture the end product.

411
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,348
Yeah, I'm sure it's hard to picture.
I'll show you when it's finished.

412
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,601
-Yay.
-Finished?

413
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,567
-Where's Hansan?
-He said he'll be back around 11:30 p.m.

414
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,319
-He's out drinking with friends?
-Yeah.

415
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,446
-You can put that there.
-Here?

416
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,910
I'm sure the curry tastes even better.

417
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,372
Why? Why?

418
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,665
Because it's the second day.

419
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:09,126
You guys seem like
you're good friends already.

420
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,628
-We are.
-We are.

421
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,962
-What?
-We get along really well.

422
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,255
-You do?
-Yeah.

423
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,591
-For now at least.
-For now?

424
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:20,012
-You never know, right?
-Yeah, you never know what'll happen.

425
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,014
Hansan's place was really great.

426
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,349
-Hansan's?
-His studio was really nice.

427
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,477
-Really. What was it like?
-Stylish.

428
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,271
Was it hard to make the table?

429
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,357
-It was easy.
-We just painted today.

430
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,695
You know how he was wearing that outfit?

431
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,447
I got a different impression from him.

432
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:41,784
-How?
-It made him look really cool.

433
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,827
Kind of badass.

434
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,747
-He was glowing.
-Yeah.

435
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,415
-Right?
-He was excited.

436
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:52,210
When you're doing what you love...

437
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,004
-Lucky.
-You glow.

438
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,757
He's known what he's wanted to do
since kindergarten.

439
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,466
What he's doing.

440
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,469
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

441
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:02,805
Bon appétit.

442
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,683
-It's good.
-It's good.

443
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,934
-Is it?
-It's good.

444
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,602
-The flavor is good.
-Yeah.

445
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,022
-Nice.
-Hats off to Nacchan.

446
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,149
-Impressive.
-Yeah.

447
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:18,361
-Do you have a grasp of each of us now?
-Yeah.

448
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,323
Hansan is still a mystery though.

449
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,241
What did you think when he said
he had a girlfriend?

450
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,327
-I was surprised.
-Yeah.

451
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,747
To come to <i>Terrace House</i>
when you have a girlfriend...

452
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:32,710
Really? I'd want to live here
even if I had a girlfriend.

453
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,920
I wouldn't let you
if I were your girlfriend.

454
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,006
Stop me? But not every guy comes here
looking for a relationship.

455
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,593
True. Maybe not stop you,
but I wouldn't like it.

456
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,847
Some girls might say that.
But maybe his girlfriend's not like that.

457
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,849
I'm full.

458
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,226
-Thank you for the food.
-Thanks.

459
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,811
Thank you for the food.

460
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,566
Once again, we were taken care of...

461
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,193
by Nacchan again.

462
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,278
Thank you, Hikaru.

463
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,614
Thanks.

464
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,033
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

465
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,827
-Thanks, Little Hikaru.
-I don't usually, so--

466
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,538
-What'd you call me?
-Thanks, Little Hikaru.

467
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,331
-"Little Hikaru"?
-Little Hikaru.

468
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,209
-Little Hikaru.
-Little Hikaru!

469
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,545
I'm just teasing.
Don't be mad.

470
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:18,547
-I'm not.
-Don't be mad.

471
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,465
It's as if I'm the angry guy.

472
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,051
You do get angry easily.

473
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,970
I'm not mad.
That's not mad.

474
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,723
You were mad yesterday.

475
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:31,059
You guys saying I was mad
when I wasn't is annoying.

476
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:33,270
See, you're mad.

477
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,106
-This is not mad.
-All washed?

478
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,483
Done.

479
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:43,363
Have you gotten used to things?
It's only been two days.

480
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,990
A little bit.

481
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,827
It's pretty easy to get comfortable.

482
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,205
I'm surprised that everyone is nicer
than I expected.

483
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,709
I don't think there's anyone bad here.

484
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:58,461
I wonder what'll happen.

485
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,549
I want to do something fun.

486
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,843
-Something fun?
-With everyone.

487
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,512
Yeah.

488
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,097
-You don't like going places?
-I do.

489
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,516
With everyone?

490
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,311
-Do you have a lot of free time?
-Yeah, I'm pretty free.

491
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,481
-Have you seen my motorcycle downstairs?
-I did.

492
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,150
I was wondering whose it was.

493
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,653
It's mine.
You can ride it.

494
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,030
I can't.
I don't have a license.

495
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,117
It's scary riding the back.

496
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:33,163
-It's not scary with me.
-I think I'd definitely be scared.

497
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,709
-I might speed up on purpose though.
-I think you would.

498
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,669
I'm just kidding.

499
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,005
I seriously want you to ride with me.
Just normally.

500
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,342
I'm scared though.

501
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:58,480
-Is it cleaner than usual in here?
-Yeah.

502
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:05,153
Earlier, when Nacchan and I went upstairs,
what did you guys talk about?

503
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,031
I was planning on asking her out.

504
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,493
Like, "Let's go somewhere."

505
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:14,747
I was planning to, but... I couldn't.

506
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,000
I couldn't find the right opening.

507
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,960
It was kind of difficult.

508
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:23,046
I did say,
"Let's go somewhere on my bike."

509
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,758
Or that's what I meant to say.

510
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,677
But I don't think she got it.

511
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:32,347
I think it's fine to just ask.

512
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,225
But she did say
she wanted to ride the bike.

513
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,852
-She did?
-Yeah.

514
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,897
She said that but you didn't ask then?

515
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,567
I asked if she wanted to ride with me.

516
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,318
You didn't say, "Let's go somewhere"?

517
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,820
Well...

518
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,699
maybe I just didn't say it right.

519
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,285
-Just ask her casually.
-Casually?

520
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,370
Yeah, casually.
You know, normally.

521
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,666
Like, "Let's go somewhere together"?

522
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:00,876
-On the bike?
-On the bike.

523
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:04,296
"You said you wanted to ride,
so let's go somewhere."

524
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,507
Nice. Sounds fun.

525
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,177
-Should I ask her now?
-Now or sometime soon.

526
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,681
-It's fresh now. She may forget later.
-She might forget.

527
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,809
It's like I'm Yuki.
I don't like it.

528
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,269
Well, everyone has their own timing.

529
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,355
I should do it today.

530
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:28,361
So he takes everyone to his studio...

531
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,656
He's so cool.
It was a good move.

532
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:34,993
-You seem happy.
-Very happy.

533
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:38,539
And his motivation, that was 100 points.

534
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:39,832
It was 100 points.

535
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:43,251
He built something when he was a kid,
and he couldn't forget how fun it was.

536
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:47,464
He went to college to study,
but he still wanted to try.

537
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,634
And then he's able to get
into Tokyo University of the Arts.

538
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:51,927
-Right?
-Right?

539
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,388
From School of Education
at Waseda University.

540
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,266
-And he never mentions it.
-He doesn't.

541
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,435
"I gave up on it once.

542
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,897
I went back."
He's so cool!

543
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,944
So perfectly balanced.

544
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:13,031
-His pentagon diagram would be perfect.
-Beautiful.

545
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:16,409
When Tamosan said,
"So this is how you got your girl."

546
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,245
His reaction wasn't,

547
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,497
"No, I don't do that!"

548
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,457
But, "Maybe it was."

549
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,585
-So good.
-That was good.

550
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:27,921
-It was really good.
-He's in a bubble. He can do anything.

551
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,173
-Anything.
-Everything.

552
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,551
-Everything he does is good.
-True.

553
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:35,137
Apparently he's always pale.

554
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,430
I don't mind that at all!

555
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:39,517
I'm totally with you.

556
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,561
So this is the bubble!

557
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:44,813
-We've seen this happen a few times.
-We have.

558
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:49,527
We've seen it a few times,
but I knew the mask would come off.

559
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,696
-This time, it's the real deal.
-It may be the real deal.

560
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,240
In the past,
even if everyone fussed over someone,

561
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,909
I knew it wouldn't last.

562
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,827
-I had a sixth sense.
-Yeah.

563
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,206
Also, the bubble tends to burst

564
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,751
when relationships get involved.

565
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,712
Their quirks tend to come out,
and the bubble usually bursts.

566
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:12,007
-So we'll see if that'll happen here.
-That's right.

567
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,678
-But Nacchan's facial expression...
-She likes him.

568
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,387
-Right?
-She likes him.

569
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,433
In the morning,
when Nacchan came back from jogging,

570
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,061
and Hansan came to the sofa...

571
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:30,776
And then she says, "I went for a jog,"
and sort of leaps from the sofa.

572
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,153
That behavior...
It was very girly.

573
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,447
-It was.
-She leapt.

574
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,407
She seemed excited.

575
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,786
Completely different from
when she was arguing at the sink before.

576
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,037
She said if she fell,

577
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,665
it wouldn't matter
if he had a girlfriend or not.

578
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,835
-So I'm sure she'll come on strong.
-I'm sure.

579
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:51,338
-I want to see how he evades those moves.
-Me too.

580
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,216
-He's gonna say something good.
-Yes, he will.

581
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,968
-I want to see it.
-He's going to deftly decline.

582
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,678
-I'm sure of it.
-I want to see!

583
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:02,182
Like, in a way that shows his sincerity.

584
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,267
Yeah.

585
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:08,271
With no false niceness from him.
Nothing fake.

586
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,942
Like, I'd want to be rejected this way.

587
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,861
You're totally seeing Hansan
from a female perspective.

588
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:20,408
Let's watch.
I want to see Handa.

589
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,083
-Welcome back.
-Hey.

590
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,335
Hey.

591
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,798
-They're smiling.
-What?

592
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,428
What movie did you guys watch?

593
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,056
-Nothing.
-Oh, really?

594
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:46,184
Hansan will be home soon.

595
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,562
Hansan said he'll be back at 11:30 p.m.

596
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:50,648
The two of them went to the studio today.

597
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,065
-I went, too.
-Arman went, too.

598
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,776
You were there, too?

599
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,654
-I thought it was just the two of you.
-I see.

600
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,989
Did they say I wasn't there?

601
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,159
You weren't mentioned, Arman,

602
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,828
-since you drove.
-So you went, too?

603
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,330
I need to use the bathroom.

604
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,752
-Do you want water, Arisa?
-I'll get it myself.

605
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,548
I'm tired of this drink.

606
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,592
There's Aoyama.

607
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:19,718
-What?
-Aoyama.

608
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,219
-What was it?
-Awamori?

609
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,144
Hansan's running late.

610
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,814
-What time is it?
-11:40 p.m.

611
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:37,360
What I was going to say...

612
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,613
What is it?

613
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,866
Do you seriously want
to go somewhere on the bike?

614
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,242
-Sure.
-You want to go?

615
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:47,746
-Where?
-You can pick.

616
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,624
-If you don't care where, I can pick.
-I don't care where.

617
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,418
You're okay on the back of a bike?

618
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,295
-The back?
-You're not riding on the back?

619
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,755
-We're taking the bike, right?
-Yeah.

620
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,965
-Are you driving?
-Wait, what?

621
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,217
-You riding behind me, right?
-Yeah.

622
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,428
Then I'll decide where.
When are you free?

623
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,556
-You're mostly free, right?
-Mostly free.

624
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,308
-What do you mean I'm mostly free?
-Because you are.

625
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,893
I am mostly free.

626
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,979
I'll ask you on a day I'm free.

627
00:30:12,081 --> 00:30:14,335
I'm going to ask you when you're free.

628
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,192
Okay.
It can be anywhere.

629
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,402
Far or close.

630
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,614
Is there something you want to do?

631
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,157
I'll leave it to you.

632
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,495
You were thinking "What a hassle!"
just now, weren't you?

633
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,413
-I wasn't.
-You're lying.

634
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,457
-It's easier when it's up to me.
-Really?

635
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,418
I can do whatever I want, right?

636
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:36,587
That's right.

637
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,673
-Then I leave it to you.
-Okay.

638
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:41,509
Okay.

639
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,012
I'll be looking forward to it.
