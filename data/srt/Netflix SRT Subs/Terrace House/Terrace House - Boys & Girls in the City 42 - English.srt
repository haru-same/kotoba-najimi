1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,934
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,519
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,313
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,024
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,984
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,277
{\an8}KENTARO FUJIMURA NOT PRESENT
DUE TO A FILM SHOOT.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,779
Things are happening at <i>Terrace House.</i>

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,781
-Last week...
-Yes, they seem to be.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,492
-We had our fifth couple form on the show.
-That's right.

11
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,663
{\an8}I like you.

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,332
{\an8}I want you to go out with me.

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,168
{\an8}I like you, too.

14
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,672
{\an8}YUUKI BYRNES, 23 YEARS OLD
MISAKI TAMORI, 24 YEARS OLD

15
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,383
{\an8}-Do you really like me?
-I really like you.

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,761
{\an8}<i>There's no stopping their feelings.</i>

17
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,223
-Yeah, it was so great.
-In Yokohama...

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,684
There's some anxiety.

19
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,768
They go camping.

20
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,981
-Yes, it turns into a harsh trip.
-That's right.

21
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,899
Lots of things happened at camp.

22
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,236
-Can so much happen in one night?
-It could.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,740
Misaki cries, frustrated at herself
for being jealous of an ex.

24
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,743
That's right.
It was an old picture on the camera.

25
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,160
Does she like him too much?

26
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,286
{\an8}I realized...

27
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,124
{\an8}how much I really like you.

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,416
{\an8}Me, too.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,920
{\an8}-I realized how much I like you.
-I really thought that.

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,338
{\an8}I'm sorry.

31
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,173
{\an8}-I'm sorry.
-I just have to believe you.

32
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,804
-After she said, "I'm sorry."
-Right?

33
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,765
Like, "I love you."

34
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:43,436
Anything that happens to them turns
into something positive at this point.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,398
-They're in a cool spot.
-That's right.

36
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,483
{\an8}A festival or to see fireworks.

37
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,110
{\an8}HAYATO TERASHIMA, 29 YEARS OLD
RIKO NAGAI, 18 YEARS OLD

38
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,112
{\an8}You sure you're okay it's with me?

39
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,406
{\an8}I want to go with you.

40
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,158
{\an8}Let's go then.

41
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,746
{\an8}<i>-They're going to wear yukatas.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

42
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,081
He asks if it's okay that it's with him...

43
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,458
But, "Let's go!"

44
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,002
He says let's go.

45
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,962
Like, is it okay to attack, too?

46
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,590
Poor Martha.

47
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,217
-Yeah...
-Yes, poor girl.

48
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,721
-Arman's engine was roaring.
-That's right.

49
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,807
Even though he's got no tires.

50
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,476
{\an8}Of all the girls I met here,
not many would say what's on their mind.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,438
{\an8}-You mean my personality?
-Yeah. And you're cute, too.

52
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,023
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD
MASAKO ENDO, 22 YEARS OLD

53
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}Out of all the girls that have been here,
I think you're the cutest.

54
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,237
{\an8}I'm serious. Why are you laughing?

55
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,614
{\an8}He might still be able to convince her.

56
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,492
I don't know. She looked sad.

57
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,495
The guy she likes
is out there with another girl.

58
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,958
And while she's thinking about that,
this guy's coming on to her.

59
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,919
<i>Even though there are fireworks,</i>
<i>nothing is fun at that point.</i>

60
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,796
<i>-I suppose.</i>
<i>-Yeah, for Martha...</i>

61
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,341
But Martha is headstrong,
so I'm sure it won't end there.

62
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,845
What move will Terashima make?

63
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:58,971
And Arman...

64
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,764
Arman... even at skateboarding,

65
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,850
<i>Byrnes was doing well, but he...</i>

66
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,977
<i>Arman was terrible!</i>

67
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,896
<i>He was quietly falling</i>
<i>in the background.</i>

68
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,149
The kind of fall
that has no entertainment value.

69
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,277
{\an8}That's Seina.

70
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,571
{\an8}-This person?
-Yeah.

71
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,701
{\an8}They started going out at <i>Terrace House.</i>

72
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,912
{\an8}These two...

73
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,040
-Oh, you mentioned Daiki before.
-Yeah.

74
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,877
Martha...

75
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,128
Why are you hanging out?

76
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,046
-We were...
-It's unusual.

77
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,589
-You were watching <i>Terrace House?</i>
-Yeah.

78
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,591
-The movie version.
-Which one is it?

79
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,885
The movie version?

80
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,847
What's wrong? You seem down.

81
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,557
Yeah, during the campfire, too.

82
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,351
There was something wrong.

83
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,479
-She asked if I was okay...
-There was something wrong.

84
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,358
Misaki asked if I was okay.

85
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,653
-I can stop it, it's okay.
-Oh, no. Okay.

86
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,489
-Take it slow.
-I'm sorry about yesterday.

87
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,783
No worries.

88
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,535
There's been a lot on my mind.

89
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,703
I've been bothered.

90
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,874
Since the barbecue,

91
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:13,170
I found myself being careful
about my behavior.

92
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,214
Sort of being reserved.

93
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,634
And at the campfire, Arman invited me
and it was the two of us.

94
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:24,222
And the other two are somehow
in perfect position in front of us.

95
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,936
So I don't know.
We'd talk, right?

96
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,565
But my focus keeps going over there.

97
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,984
None of what Arman was saying
was registering, right?

98
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,821
It did! It did, but...

99
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,199
But still, it's like,
why is this happening?

100
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,951
I couldn't help but think that.

101
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,036
But that bothered feeling

102
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,747
is probably there
because I'm aware of my uncertainty.

103
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:50,833
I don't know.

104
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,922
And then afterward, we all gathered
and went to get fireworks.

105
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,131
But after that...

106
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:03,136
Riko asked Hayato out on a date.

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,805
Oh, really?

108
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,891
Riko was talking really happily.

109
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,769
That expression really affected me.

110
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,731
-You must really like him.
-No, but...

111
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,274
Maybe.

112
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,568
If it's making you cry this much.

113
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,324
It's what you want to do about it.

114
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,326
I really don't know.

115
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,287
-Yeah.
-I thought that you...

116
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,791
I thought you'd be the type
to ask him out more casually.

117
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,087
-But you're pretty...
-I was going to try that.

118
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,381
I thought about asking casually.

119
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,634
I think that's fine.
Just ask him.

120
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:47,764
Because you never know.
It might not work out either.

121
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,769
But you're thinking about Riko.

122
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,022
So is that why you can't?

123
00:05:55,105 --> 00:06:00,193
If I just casually ask him out to lunch,
I think it'd be okay.

124
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,113
I don't think there's any reason
you have to withdraw.

{\an8}-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

132
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,127
{\an8}-You look sleepy.
-Why do you have your hat on?

133
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,545
I went straight to work.

134
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,547
Oh, that's right.

135
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,840
To work, that is.

136
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,758
-I'm exhausted.
-You must be super sleepy.

137
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,469

-What?
-You're in pajamas.

140
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,850
Yep, I'm in pajamas!
Oops, I kicked my leg.

141
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,019
-The pajama-look is great, isn't it?
-No way.

142

-It's looks cute.
-That makes me happy.

144
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,942
What? With Misaki?

145
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,818
An easy make-up?

146
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,071
-Yeah.
-It wasn't awkward?

147
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,156
That's good.

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,953
Hayato, for lunch...

149
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,414
What do you do during work?
Just eat at work?

150
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,458
-Food from work?
-No.

151
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,293
I eat out. Whatever I feel like.

152
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,711
No way.

153
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,381
Let's go grab quick lunch.
A quick lunch.

154
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,424
-Sure. Lunch?
-It could be tea.

155
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,426
Sure.

156
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,388
Okay.

157
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,390
-It'll be late though, most likely.
-What?

158
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,849
How about tea?

159
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,603
-No, I...
-Why did you stutter on "tea"?

160
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,980
-Tea?
-No, I...

161
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,774
What happened?

162
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,403
After lunch time,
so it'll be around 2:00 or 3:00 p.m.

163
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,571
-That's fine.
-You'll get hungry.

164
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,407
-Most people would be.
-I can wait.

165
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
-You want to?
-A quick lunch.

166
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,161
Should we go, then?

167
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,039
-Let's go.
-Okay.

168
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,706
Any day.

169
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,958
-Any day that works for you.
-This week works.

170
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,210
Any day that works for you.

171
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,379
Okay.

172
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,341
{\an8}GAIENMAE, TOKYO

173
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,392
{\an8}-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Hello.

174
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,936
-Is here okay?
-Yeah.

175
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,147
-Break time?
-Yeah, break time.

176
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,441
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Not at all.

177
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,401
-Did you wait long?
-Not at all.

178
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,904
-I'm hungry.
-You're hungry? Should we order?

179
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,325
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

180
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,162
I haven't been doing anything.

181
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,830
Just a quick lunch?

182
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,416
We haven't really talked.

183
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,502
-What?
-I've been meaning to ask.

184
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,629
You invited me to lunch, right?

185
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,720
-What are your motivations...
-My feelings, you mean?

186
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,888
I'm sure it's just casual, but...

187
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,684
I asked because I wanted to get to know
you better.

188
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,977
Of course.

189
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,481
Why? Why?

190
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,444
For me, because I know how Arman feels.

191
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,738
Not that he's fallen for you yet.

192
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,240
He said something?

193
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,119
-Well, he's asked you out on dates, right?
-Yeah.

194
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,624
-So it's tough to go out with you.
-I see.

195
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:47,879
-So I wanted to make that clear.
-It's the same for me.

196
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,423
-It's the same for me.
-Because of Riko?

197
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,217
But...

198
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,345
But I... Oh, thank you.

199
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,849
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

200
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,810
Did you hear that Riko asked me out?

201
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,856
To the festival? You heard?

202
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:12,570
For Riko, I think it took a lot of effort.

203
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,283
How did it make you feel?

204
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,910
Is it okay to ask? You don't have
to say if you don't want to.

205
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,245
It made me happy.

206
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,330
-Yeah, it was the first time, right?
-Yeah.

207
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,041
But I'm not sure if it's okay.

208
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,377
What makes you think that way?

209
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,963
-She's working hard right now.
-What do you mean?

210
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,090
-With work. She's just starting.
-Yeah.

211
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:38,596
My presence might have
a negative impact, I think.

212
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,059
But that's not for you to decide, is it?

213
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,146
-It's not, but it concerns me.
-Well, yeah.

214
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,278
If Riko asks, would you be able
to tell her about this?

215
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,571
-I could.
-You could?

216
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,199
-You mean this lunch, right?
-Yeah. You can totally tell her?

217
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,035
I don't mind telling
Arman about this, too.

218
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,038
Of course we can tell them about this.

219
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,541
I could, but...

220
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,252
But what?

221
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,048
Maybe we shouldn't go out
alone together anymore.

222
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,343
Us, you mean? Sure.

223
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,096
That's totally fine.

224
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,685
-I'm sorry.
-No.

225
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,821
He knows what's right, it seems.

226
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,115
It's Arman's fault?

227
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,411
-He turned her down.
-He turned her down, but he's Terashima.

228
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,374
People don't usually say
this stuff at this point.

229
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,253
-Yeah.
-I mean, it was just lunch.

230
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,297
-Yeah.
-It'd be embarrassing if you're wrong.

231
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,965
-It's hard to bring up.
-It is.

232
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,801
-What if you're wrong?
-That's right.

233
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,219
But Terashima can be like that.

234
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,138
But at this point,
the two of them are meeting.

235
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,849
I think so too, Torichan.
We're the same.

236
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,727
-You. Hey, you...
-The same?

237
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,729
-What?
-You...

238
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,357
You've never experienced this.

239
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,941
What?

240
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:19,906
Two girls tell you they like you.

241
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:26,913
And then you have to do
right for both of them.

242
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,332
You're not picturing it!

243
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,250
You're not able to picture it at all!

244
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,169
Your canvas is blank.

245
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,713
So Terashima is going with Riko?

246
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,174
-The love triangle is over?
-Yeah.

247
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,842
-It's ended.
-Yeah.

248
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,929
So Arman can get in when she's vulnerable.

249
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,181
I don't know about that.

250
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:50,728
There's a slim chance
that a miracle may happen.

251
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,647
Yeah, there is that slim chance.

252
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,277
But I'm not sure that Arman
will take that chance.

253
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,322
He probably won't see the slim opening.

254
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,411
Yes?

255
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,582
Why are you knocking?

256
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:11,958
In case you were doing something.

257
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,710
-Hey.
-Hey.

258
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,338
Sorry to come in suddenly.

259
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,506
-Not at all.
-I don't mean to be all formal.

260
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,886
But there's something I have to tell you.

261
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,390
Something I should have said earlier.

262
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,516
Oh.

263
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,477
-Oh?
-Oh.

264
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,771
You know how we went camping?

265
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,567
And it naturally split off into
me and Arman, Riko and Hayato,

266
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,695
and Misaki and Yuuki.

267
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,824
It really bothered me at the time.

268
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,160
So yesterday, I asked Hayato,

269
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:53,583
even if it's between shifts,
if he'd want to get lunch with me.

270
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,876
I invited him out.

271
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,336
So we went out to lunch today.

272
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,008
But he said he felt guilty.

273
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,720
He clearly said he felt guilty.

274
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,640
And that he couldn't go out
with just me anymore.

275
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,392
So...

276
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,603
So, I know it's kind of late,

277
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:18,816
but I felt that maybe
I should have told you earlier.

278
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,487
I'm really sorry I'm telling you now.

279
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,780
No...

280
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,867
I totally didn't notice.

281
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,288
-Really?
-I've never asked anyone out before.

282
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,248
So my mind was occupied with that.

283
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,421
I couldn't think of anything else.

284
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:46,135
So I don't think just the two of us
will be going out anymore.

285
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,557
Are you okay with that?

286
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,185
It's not that I've stopped
being interested in him.

287
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,937
That's the truth.

288
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,856
I don't want you
to have to lie to yourself.

289
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,820
And I don't want you
to agonize over it.

290
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:11,536
When I move on, I'm sure I'll be able
to tell you more honestly next time.

291
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,581
I'm glad to hear that.

292
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,167
With this as an opportunity.

293
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,089
I'm still not sure about Hayato.

294
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,925
I'm not really sure how I feel.

295
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,929
But he understood that it took effort
for you to ask him out.

296
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,140
I see.

297
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,602
He noticed the effort it took?

298
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,481
{\an8}MISHUKU, TOKYO

299
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:47,196
{\an8}We did go to lunch, since he agreed to go.

300
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,198
{\an8}We went yesterday.

301
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,324
{\an8}Wow, real-time.

302
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,618
{\an8}MAMI NAKAMURA
HAIR AND MAKE-UP

303
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,495
{\an8}-It's super real-time.
-So we went.

304
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,664
He told me the two of us
can't go out alone anymore.

305
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,668
I was rejected before
I could ask him out on a date.

306
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,130
That's what happened.

307
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,048
-Really?
-Yeah.

308
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,175
Now I...

309
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:14,140
I want to support Riko.

310
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,893
-I see.
-Yeah.

311
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,437
When you have
someone you're interested in,

312
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,650
can you really hold back your feelings?

313
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,111
I'm running from my feelings.

314
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,280
It makes me run away, I think.

315
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,115
Maybe it's pride.

316
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,995
-You can't be honest?
-No.

317
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,666
I get how you feel.

Hey.

323
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,541
Welcome back.

324
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,963
What's wrong, Yuuki?

325
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,638
What?

326
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,518
Arman and I were going to the market.

327
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,980
And...

328
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,817
we were on skateboards.

329
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,028
I suddenly heard a big sound.

330
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:57,034
And when I looked up,
a car was stopped in the intersection

331
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,953
and Arman was on the ground.

332
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,708
We called the ambulance
and he went to the hospital.

333
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,044
When did that happen?

334
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,088
-Just a while ago.
-Just a while ago?

335
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,757
How is he?

336
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,385
-His head was bleeding.
-Seriously?

337
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,511
Yeah.

338
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,722
Was he conscious?

339
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,974
-He was.
-He was.

340
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,148
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

341
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,402
What should we do? Just wait?

342
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,665
Hey.

343
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,421
-How are you?
-You surprised me.

344
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,967
-We were so worried.
-I'm alive.

345
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,302
I'm so relieved.

346
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,724
Your shirt's ripped.

347
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,770
-I'm so relieved.
-Sorry to worry you.

348
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,730
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

349
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,191
No bones are broken.

350
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,819
-Scary.
-I just need to take meds.

351
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,904
I got four stitches.

352
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,572
I'm so relieved, though.

353
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,407
I'm sorry, Yuuki.

354
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,915
-I'm glad.
-I'm really relieved.

355
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,751
I'm seriously sorry.

356
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,545
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

357
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,602
-Sorry.
-You might have been dead.

358
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,821
-My tooth chipped a little.
-Do you want some water?

359
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
Thanks.

360
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,200
-Your tooth chipped?
-Yeah, it did.

361
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,414
It's fine that you're always...

362
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,711
so care free to do what you like.

363
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,840
-That's something good about you, but...
-Let me just switch seats.

364
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,008
But...

365
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:24,265
But I want you to realize
when things are dangerous.

366
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,560
You're right.
I won't do anything stupid anymore.

367
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,604
Seriously.

368
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,651
I'm sorry for making you worry.

369
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,279
Everyone.

370
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,701
-Remember that there are people who worry.
-Yeah.

371
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,086
{\an8}No, I've never done Gravia.

372
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,546
{\an8}Shonen Sunday Shoot!

373
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,423
{\an8}-So it's your first Gravia?
-Yes, my first time.

374
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,722
Well, since it's your first time...

375
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:11,187
-Yes.
-There's probably a lot to consider.

376
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,439
Like how to pose.

377
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,484
-Ready to begin.
-Ready.

378
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,486
{\an8}WEEKLY SHONEN SUNDAY
COVER GRAVIA SHOOT

379
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,865
{\an8}-Very cute.
-Cute.

380
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,035
Bring your hood up higher.

381
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,704
-She's the cutest girl in Japan.
-In all of Japan?

382
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,832
Looks cute.

383
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,208
Without the hood...

384
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,462
-Can you do it without the hood?
-Yes.

385
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,173
-You're okay?
-Let's take off the jacket.

386
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,719
Show us your waistline.

387
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,888
-Amazing.
-Stop.

388
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,556
-Please stop.
-You don't like that right?

389
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,851
-Yeah, I really don't.
-You don't?

390
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,436
-It's embarrassing.
-Please stop that.

391
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,023
Okay. Nice.

392
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:04,031
The innocent look is nice.

393
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,410
Can you lean forward a little?

394
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,871
-Forward?
-The light...

395
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,250
Okay. Good.

396
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,837
Okay, it looks good.

397
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,671
Good work.

398
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,217
Then let's wet her hair.

399
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,220
We'll do a shot
like you came out from the pool.

400
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,856
Are you okay?

401
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,951
Okay.

402
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,204
Good, good.

403
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,374
Okay.

404
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,251
Good, good.

405
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,962
Nice, nice.

406
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,382
{\an8}Okay, we're done.

407
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,301
{\an8}-Good work.
-Thank you.

408
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,388
I was remembering things.

409
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,599
-It made me emotional.
-You were remembering?

410
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,643
{\an8}Right now, I'm sure there will be times

411
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,937
{\an8}YUJI MATSUO
MANAGER

412
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,854
{\an8}when you're not sure
about what you're doing.

413
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:23,152
But in the end, I'm sure
it'll become something you're happy with.

414
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,361
Yes.

415
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,031
Thank you.

416
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,991
-I hope you work hard.
-Yes.

417
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,082
{\an8}Did you see the drawings I did?

418
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,001
{\an8}-You've only done two, though.
-I haven't finished.

419
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,045
-Hayato looks like him, though.
-Right?

420
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,130
-Riko too, actually.
-It looks like Riko, right?

421
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,218
-What are you doing about meals?
-I eat whatever.

422
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,344
-No way.
-Seriously.

423
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,097
-Tell me when you're off.
-Okay.

424
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,766
-Tomorrow.
-I don't know about tomorrow.

425
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,395
If I have time,
I'll totally make something.

426
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,773
I'll be living like this
for the next three days at least.

427
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,026
I think it'll be more than three days.

428
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,071
-You're taking time off work, too?
-I am.

429
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,118
There's so many areas to put this on.

430
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
Looks painful.

431
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,751
Looks really painful.

432
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,005
Can I just ask you to do my face?
Just here.

433
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,465
-Why, can't you do that yourself?
-I can't see.

434
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,092
-Okay.
-Thanks.

435
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,761
Here.

436
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,098
It looks super painful.
You sure it's okay?

437
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,395
-Just kidding. It's not bad.
-But it looks seriously painful.

438
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,022
It looks so painful.

439
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,358
-I can put some here?
-Yeah.

440
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,776
Looks painful.

441
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,196
Yeah, just there.

442
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,074
-Looks so painful. Okay.
-Okay, thanks.

443
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,661
What about your ears?

444
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,498
-The ear looks painful.
-The ears are fine. It's dry.

445
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,750
-I put some on yesterday.
-It's dry here, too.

446
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,670
I just wanted you to put it on.

447
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
Who? By who?

448
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,341
Oh, it's Yuuki Byrnes.

449
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,260
You came back together?

450
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,554
-Yeah, we came back together.
-Welcome back.

451
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,139
-Welcome back.
-I saw him at the station.

452
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,308
-Oops, I said I'm back.
-Welcome home.

453
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:21,187
I saw a bunch of books. Are you studying?

454
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,106
-Yeah, a little.
-I see.

455
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,234
-To be a child care worker?
-Yeah.

456
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,946
Did you go?

457
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,534
With Hayato?

458
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,828
Didn't you say you were going
to lunch with him?

459
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,789
-Yeah, I did.
-You said you were going to...

460
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,543
-I told Misaki, but I haven't told you.
-Yeah.

461
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,795
-Yeah, I did.
-How was it?

462
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,215
I forgot about it already.

463
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,342
-It's fine.
-You forgot?

464
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,886
-What about with Arman?
-What?

465
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,639
Well, Arman's in this state, right?

466
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,392
So what about your plans?

467
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,728
-Won't be until later?
-Yeah.

468
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,189
After I get better.

469
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,359
So you guys just had lunch?

470
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,945
-Yeah, we just had lunch.
-I see.

471
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,905
You didn't talk?

472
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,866
We did talk.

473
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,161
But I've forgotten the details already.

474
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,163
When did you go? Recently?

475
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,750
Last week? For now...

476
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,129
the two of us can't go out alone.

477
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,505
Why?

478
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,007
There's a reason for it.

479
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,553
Having heard the reason...

480
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,096
well...

481
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,849
I felt he had a point.

482
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:46,397
-So I understood.
-Well, we'll see how things go anyway.

483
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,900
-Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
-I see.

484
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,611
I didn't realize.

485
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,828
You asked if she went out
with Hayato, right?

486
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,666
Arman didn't know about it.

487
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:10,462
You know how Martha feels
and you know how Arman feels.

488
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,340
-I do.
-Knowing that,

489
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,967
it's something you shouldn't have asked.

490
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,722
That's what I thought.
If Arman wasn't there...

491
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,101
then you could've asked how it went.

492
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:29,273
I'm sorry about that.
I wasn't thinking at all.

493
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,444
We all live together,
so it's something you should think about.

494
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,822
Yeah. I'll be careful from now on.

495
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,049
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

496
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,843
-You're up?
-I'm up.

497
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,094
What are you making?

498
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,637
-Green curry and...
-Seriously?

499
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,723
And Tom Yum Gai soup.

500
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,015
-Oh, nice.
-Do you like it?

501
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,767
-I love it.
-Seriously?

502
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,312
-You said you liked Thai food.
-I love it.

503
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,689
-It's my first time.
-What?

504
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,483
-It's my first time.
-What is?

505
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,486
Being run over by a car
and then having someone cook for me.

506
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,737
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

507
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,323
Did you talk to Yuuki?

508
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,326
Yeah. We did.

509
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,788
When we were all together,
you said you had lunch with Hayato.

510
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,957
-Yeah.
-So, about that.

511
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,166
You were concerned about it?

512
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,878
He apologized for saying it
without considering it.

513
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,464
I'm fine, though. I don't mind.

514
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,924
You seem like you'd be fine.

515
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,513
How was it, though?
Was lunch with Hayato fun?

516
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,349
It was fun. It was fun, but...

517
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,143
Yeah.

518
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:53,274
Like I said yesterday,
it's not like anything's going to happen.

519
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,861
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

520
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,655
-We can finally eat.
-Looks great.

521
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,159
-How is it?
-It's good.

522
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,246
-It's edible?
-It's great.

523
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,831
-You have to go to the hospital tomorrow?
-Yeah.

524
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,793
Get better quick so we could go somewhere.

525
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,127
Yeah.

526
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,841
If I get cleared,
let's go somewhere this weekend.

527
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,843
-This weekend?
-Yeah.

528
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,304
It was really good. Thank you.

529
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,264
-No problem.
<i>-Kapunka.</i>

530
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,017
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

531
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,978
-Thanks for the meal.
-I'm going to go get ready.

532
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,274
I'm going to go get ready.

533
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,900
Leave it. I'll wash up later.

534
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,862
-Will you really?
-I will. I'll be home all day.

535
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,489
So you are going to be home.

536
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,329
I'm full.

537
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,164
I'm so full. See you later, Arman.

538
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,749
Yeah, good luck.

539
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,547
-That was surprising.
-I was so surprised.

540
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,677
So they went to the market on a skateboard
and Arman was run over by a car?

541
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,554
When he looked, Arman was on the floor.

542
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,098
-I mean, he was so terrible at it.
-Yeah.

543
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,016
It was too much.

544
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,896
{\an8}Also, according to the law,
"For streets with heavy traffic,

545
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:21,111
{\an8}the use of roller skates, and other
similar activities, are prohibited."

546
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,657
{\an8}Arman was reprimanded by the officer
in charge of the case.

547
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:29,035
-So Arman was at fault.
-Totally.

548
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,124
-Things are going well with Martha.
-She just put medicine on him.

549
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,877
-She also cooked for him.
-That's true.

550
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,796
"Ointment-play" is a thing.

551
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,633
Really? It is nice to have ointment
rubbed on you.

552
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,718
The mucous membrane, right?

553
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,803
I've heard of that before.

554
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,056
So when I hear he's got a fever,

555
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,184
-I really want to put in the enema.
-I don't understand.

556
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,811
"Let me put it in!"

557
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,188
-You've totally lost us.
-Really?

558
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,191
I was right with you
but then you took off!

559
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:06,698
So I'm happy when they're vulnerable.

560
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,117
I have heard you should
attack when they're vulnerable.

561
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,704
-Well, attack, yes...
-It's like threading a needle.

562
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,916
It's the smallest path. It's there, but...

563
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,127
It's like what we were saying
about a slim chance.

564
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,379
So it's flipped around.

565
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:24,508
-It was a miracle.
-Yes, thanks to the accident,

566
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:29,095
they ate together,
and though Martha wasn't love-struck,

567
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,847
she was comfortable.

568
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:35,018
She realizes it's easy to be with him.
She doesn't have to try so hard.

569
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,312
If she feels that way, then maybe...

570
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,899
Well, even as we say this,
after the accident,

571
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,902
he may have thought
he could get closer to Martha,

572
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,779
but then Yuuki Byrnes comes along

573
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,741
and reveals Martha likes Terashima.
Oh, his expression...

574
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,869
When Arman was run over,

575
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,581
Byrnes was the one
who apologized the most.

576
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,875
-Even though he cried the most.
-He cried the most.

577
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,545
But he dumped salt on his wounds.

578
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,921
Here, take that!

579
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,467
-Of course, Misaki was upset.
-Yes.

580
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,845
Riko's tears over her Gravia shoot.

581
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,433
According to Triendl,
your first shoot was like that.

582
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,602
-Tends to make you feel that way.
-I see.

583
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,895
You didn't like to do bathing suit shots?

584
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,564
I never did a bathing suit shoot.

585
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,066
-You haven't?
-I haven't, but...

586
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:28,238
But you felt that way at shoots
where you had to show more skin?

587
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,742
-That's never happened to me before.
-Oh, you haven't.

588
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,702
Father, please!

589
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,912
She was acting like she understood.

590
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,582
Well, she's the only here who would.

591
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,208
What about you?

592
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,336
I have, but just sumo wrestling
in a bathing suit.

593
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,381
-Ah, that kind.
-It might've been a little different.

594
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,134
-You didn't cry?
-No, I didn't.

595
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,178
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

596
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:57,976
{\an8}It's raining. And its my second time
going to 109 with you.

597
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,815
{\an8}-There's so many.
-There's a lot.

598
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,652
{\an8}Where should we start?

599
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,364
Did Hayato say what kind he likes?

600
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,575
Hayato...

601
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,412
said something pastel colored.

602
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,331
-Pastel?
-That's what I wanted anyway.

603
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,751
Pastel?

604
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,672
Maybe a white base? That's cute.

605
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,133
-Is this more mature?
-Yeah, it's cute.

606
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,427
This one, then?

607
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,220
Is this one really okay?

608
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,681
Does it match my face?

609
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,810
Yeah, it's good.
The belt will change it's look.

610
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,687
Then I'll go with this one.

611
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,855
Okay, it's decided.

612
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,740
I'm surprised you decided to go.

613
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:58,954
Because you invited him,
have your feelings changed?

614
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:04,543
If I'm restricted by my own rules...

615
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,921
-Like Arman said?
-Yeah, I can't be happy.

616
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,092
So if I feel like I want to go,
then I should go.

617
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,426
That's true.

618
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,136
Hayato understands, right?

619
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,889
Because you told him
you didn't want a yukata date at first.

620
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,059
But now that you've asked him...

621
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:27,440
Even though you haven't said so in words,
he must know how you feel.

622
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,739
I don't know how Hayato feels,

623
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,032
but what are you going to do
if he says something?

624
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,744
-If he says he likes me?
-Yeah.

625
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,581
I'd be happy, but...

626
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,207
-You'd think about it.
-Yeah.

627
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,379
And I'd still feel like, "Really?"

628
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,548
I'd have doubts.
I'd want to be sure.

629
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,717
Yeah.

630
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,344
But that means you're already...

631
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,766
-I must have feelings for him.
-Yeah.

632
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,519
It's gradual.

633
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,024
-You're getting closer to liking him?
-Yeah.

634
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,942
-I know I'm slow, but...
-Yeah.
