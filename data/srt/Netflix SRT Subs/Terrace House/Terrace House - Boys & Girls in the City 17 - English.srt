1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,725
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,310
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,188
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,816
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,818
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:30,781
{\an8}Previously, love ended for two people.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,490
{\an8}It was hell, wasn't it?

9
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,702
{\an8}-Let's use it sometime.
-The car?

10
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,287
{\an8}Everyone said they wanted to go to Costco.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,872
{\an8}I'll think of where we can go
for a day trip.

12
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,248
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD

13
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,417
{\an8}-A day trip?
-Yeah, with the car.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,295
{\an8}-Let's drive somewhere.
-Not Costco?

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,630
"If it's to Costco..."

16
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,800
"If it's to Costco with everyone."

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,176
That was terrible, wasn't it?

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:57,975
She's obviously not interested in him,
but he's a little oblivious.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,561
{\an8}I didn't get to properly
ask you out earlier.

20
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,105
{\an8}With just the two of us.

21
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,191
{\an8}Instead of going with just the two of us,
like a day trip.

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,069
{\an8}I'd rather go somewhere with everyone.

23
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,154
{\an8}That second attempt was hell.

24
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,490
{\an8}It really was hellish.

25
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,410
{\an8}-And Mizuki had dinner with Arman.
-It was so sad!

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,497
{\an8}To be honest, since Arisa came...

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,709
{\an8}I've been attracted to her.

28
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,418
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD

29
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,837
{\an8}I'll be rooting for you.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,547
{\an8}<i>-And Yu's famous words here.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

31
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,260
"Mizuki cut her hair because feelings
linger in the ends of your hair."

32
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,054
-Such beautiful words.
-They were.

33
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,766
-I had goosebumps.
-Me too.

34
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,059
They could've just closed
the show with that.

35
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,104
Like, "Oh, of course!"

36
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,442
-And Tap and Mizuki considered leaving.
-Tori-chan.

37
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,987
You can't call him Tap.

38
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:56,825
It sounds a lot more mean coming from you.

39
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,202
{\an8}We have one more month.

40
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,247
{\an8}-And I wanted to stay until the end.
-Yeah.

41
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,625
{\an8}I am considering leaving.

42
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,168
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD
MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD

43
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,878
{\an8}I might leave now.

44
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,004
{\an8}Really?

45
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,381
{\an8}Maybe Seina is going to come back.

46
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,549
{\an8}SEINA SHIMABUKURO, 28 YEARS OLD

47
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,509
{\an8}Saying, "What's going on, guys?"

48
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,804
{\an8}"What's going on?"

49
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,764
{\an8}Let's just answer, "Nothing,"
and turn her away.

50
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,019
{\an8}Where's the traditional Japanese room?

51
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,690
{\an8}It smells good.

52
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,607
{\an8}-I've never been here.
-Me neither.

53
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}-It's the first for me, too.
-This is nice.

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,864
{\an8}-I didn't know we had this.
-Yeah.

55
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,992
{\an8}Wow, what's this?

56
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,244
{\an8}It opens.

57
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,205
{\an8}Oh, I've never opened that before.

58
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,208
{\an8}Wow, luxurious feather comforters.

59
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,085
Smells new.

60
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,878
There's a lot.

61
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,089
-Want to lay it out?
-This one?

62
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,342
There are two sets, so two sets?

63
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,469
Maybe just one set.

64
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,432
-I guess two.
-I'll lay out both for now.

65
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,477
Isn't this a great room?

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,187
It is.
It should be used.

67
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,527
{\an8}-Hey.
-Hey.

68
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,653
{\an8}What's up?

69
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,949
What?

70
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,575
Mizuki called us here.

71
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,786
To go upstairs.

72
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,164
The two of you always sleep here.

73
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,875
-Yeah.
-And look really cold.

74
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,086
You guys always look cold sleeping here.

75
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,005
So we...

76
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,840
Well...

77
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,511
-Don't make it so serious.
-What?

78
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,678
You're scaring them.

79
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,680
-What?
-What's going on?

80
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,767
You're trying to be considerate of us.

81
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,434
We're not.

82
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,187
-There's another room.
-Another room?

83
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,939
There's a Japanese-style room upstairs.

84
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,734
I see. A traditional Japanese room?

85
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,445
-So, you know, you can use it.
-If we want, you mean?

86
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,906
We set it up just in case.

87
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,115
Set it up?

88
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,743
Like at a traditional Japanese inn.

89
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,912
That's why you called us?

90
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,538
Thanks, guys.

91
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,831
You're welcome.

92
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,000
-Well, then...
-Take a look.

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,627
Oh, yeah. Wanna see it?

94
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,129
-Yeah, sure.
-It's really nice.

95
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,298
Since you went through the trouble.

96
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,929
Wow.

97
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,138
This...

98
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,391
-Isn't it a bit much?
-Definitely.

99
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,316
I can't believe they did this.

100
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,121
You look unhappy about it.

Leftovers from yesterday?

109
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,479
-Want some?
-I do.

110
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,398
Working today?

111
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,526
-Right now...
-Yeah?

112
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,694
...I'm making samples for an exhibition.

113
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,989
There's a shop that carries the materials.

114
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,159
But because there's so many,
I could look at them all day.

115
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,244
You mean, like, fabrics?

116
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,913
Yeah, it's the size of a stadium.

117
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,622
I can spend the entire day there.

118
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,042
You're going to finish your samples?

119
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,086
I'll finish them by the end of the year,

120
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,839
and then I'll rework them
and get them ready for the exhibition.

121
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,800
How many are you making?

122
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,218
There are eight base models,

123
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,637
but there's color variations,
so a total of, maybe, 25.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,597
-I see.
-Yeah.

125
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,266
Do you have work today?

126
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,269
School. School then work.

127
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,229
Do you have plans for Christmas?

128
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,605
The 24th.

129

-So, you haven't made plans yet?
-No.

131

So, Uchi's planning for you.

132

-You think so?
-Yeah.

133
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,368
-What are your plans for Christmas?
-Me?

134
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,121

00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,059
Hello.

139
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,853
Yes, the hats...

140
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,234
How much are the Panamas?

141
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,863
-The Panamas, including tax?
-Yes.

142
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,365
The whites are 4,200 yen.

143
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,702
-The black Panamas?
-Those are 3,400 yen.

144

-The blacks are 3,400 yen?
-3,400 yen.

145

And the balibuntal?

146
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,377
Balibuntal in natural?

147
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,132
If you have natural, white and black,
that's great.

148
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,762
{\an8}Hey.

149

151
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,269
Your hair's crazy.

152
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,687
It's okay, right?

153
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,819
What's up?

154
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,155
I'm thinking of leaving.

155
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,867
-That's sudden.
-Why?

156
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,705
I've always wanted to go to Africa,

157
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,375
the birthplace of tap and rhythm.

158
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,501
What're you gonna do, Uchi?

159
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,461
Me? My plans?

160
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,380
I'm going to discuss it with Minori.

161
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,674
I'll talk to her.

162
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,802
-Wow.
-Is that almost done?

163
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,137
This is just the material.

164
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,015
It's cute! Really cute.
I like it as is.

165
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,184
-As is?
-Try it on.

166
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,271
-Wow!
-But as is?

167
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,815
That one is raffia.

168
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,734
And this one's a Panama from Ecuador.

169
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,903
-Ecuador?
-Yes, from Ecuador.

170
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,948
I'm gonna work on these, then go to sleep.

171
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,909
-Work?
-I'm going to work, then sleep.

172
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,830
Then before you do that,
I have to tell you guys something.

173
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,251
I'm going to leave.

174
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,088
-Is it decided?
-Yeah.

175
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,547
When?

176
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,631
Why?

177
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,259
Because I don't want you to go!

178
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,639
-It's because the show is extended, right?
-Yeah.

179
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,476
I've come to a decision.

180
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,562
I figured it was time.

181
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,191
There's nothing more
you wanted to do here?

182
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,611
No, not really.

183
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,779
Well, except maybe spend Christmas here.

184
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,158
-I'm sad.
-Me too.

185
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,914
Wait, what was that prank about?

186
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,750
The traditional Japanese room prank.

187
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,711
And they never touched
on what happened after.

188
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,714
That's right.
It just cut to the chige breakfast.

189
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,342
-Chige and natto.
-Yeah.

190
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,888
Well, chige and natto, both are soybeans,
so I'm sure it went together.

191
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,308
-I wasn't talking about the food.
-No?

192
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,476
No, I wasn't.

193
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,230
Well, the fact she was able to eat
chige, natto and rice in the morning,

194
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,815
means that she was hungry.
That means...

195
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,941
It means...

196
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,530
I totally thought Arisa would be the type
to blush and leave the room.

197
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,533
No one would do that.

198
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,119
Not with a lame joke like that.

199
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,454
I see. But it was still a shock.

200
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,540
And what's even more of a shock,

201
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,917
towards the end, there was a moment
where I felt

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,794
maybe she wasn't a good person.

203
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,878
When?

204
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,463
Well, when she asked Mizuki

205
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,633
whether there was anything more
she wanted to do there.

206
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,054
I just felt like
she should be the last person to ask that.

207
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,224
After all, she is the reason
that things didn't happen for Mizuki.

208
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,186
-But maybe she's just the oblivious type.
-Which is it?

209
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,646
Which is it?

210
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,856
Are you talking to yourself?

211
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,775
-Or are you asking us?
-What are you asking us?

212
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,528
I'm talking to myself. I'm sorry.

213
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,239
Your idea of Arisa
is falling apart, right?

214
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,115
And you can't accept it, right?

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,952
The two Arisas are battling in my mind.

216
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,287
It's already broken.

217
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,791
But, anyway, as Tap was asking,
what are they going to do?

218
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,418
-That's true.
-They're a couple now,

219
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,462
is there any point in staying?

220
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,672
Just like how Tap asked Uchi.

221
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,881
Maybe they're all going to leave?

222
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,760
-That's a possibility.
-That's true.

223
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,563
Did something happen?

224
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,067
That was sudden.

225
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,071
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

226
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,658
You guys look relaxed.

227
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,827
We're just chillin'.

228
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,455
Something happened, right?

229
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,999
-You okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

230
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,210
I knew something must have happened.

231
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,295
Something happened?

232
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,798
I was out with Uchi.

233
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,718
We went to eat sushi.
We biked there.

234
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,927
-Today?
-Today.

235
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,971
It's been a while since we really talked.

236
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,098
Our schedules haven't lined up.

237
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:09,604
Towards the end, things got awkward,
and we came home in silence.

238
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,274
You talked about your future plans?

239
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,776
We didn't say too much about it.

240
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:19,614
But since the show was extended,
we hadn't discussed what would happen.

241
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,327
Uchi's plans and mine...

242
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,579
are different.

243
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,417
I didn't want it to turn into an issue,
so I didn't press it.

244
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,835
You tried to avoid talking--

245
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,879
Not that I don't want to discuss it,

246
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,716
but I do tend to clam up
about issues I want to avoid.

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,843
I know it's bad.

248
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,012
The discussion didn't really go anywhere.

249
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,686
He can't talk about things lightly.

250
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,355
When he start talking it gets really...

251
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,690
-Heavy?
-Yes, heavy.

252
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,318
The talk becomes serious.

253
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,611
He has that tendency.

254
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,905
That's not good either.

255
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,467
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

256
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,303
-Oh, sorry I left the dishes.
-Don't worry about it.

257
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,014
-Thanks.
-Yeah, just leave it there.

258
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,226
-Nice work.
-Yeah, nice work.

259
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,771
It's been a little awkward lately.

260
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,858
-With Uchi?
-Yeah.

261
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,276
-How come?
-Well...

262
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,488
the show was extended, right?

263
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,574
We hadn't really discussed our plans.

264
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,660
It's kind of difficult.

265
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,204
Can't you guys talk like you always do?

266
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,291
Well, when we talk about it...

267
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,712
it gets really heavy.

268
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,298
It becomes really negative.

269
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,843
Uchi has that tendency.

270
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,805
He tells me to speak my mind, so I do,

271
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,267
but then he interrupts with objections.

272
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,061
Even though he told me to say what I feel.

273
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,898
It's a difference in thought...

274
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,359
I think.

275
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,198
{\an8}What time are you going tomorrow?

276
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,951
{\an8}I'll leave around 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

277
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,412
{\an8}To weigh in.

278
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,163
-Oh, you have to weigh in?
-Yeah.

279
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,957
The match starts around 3:30 p.m.

280
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,502
-Finally.
-Finally.

281
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,961
I can finally drink.

282
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,713
That's not the right attitude!

283
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,340
Not that! It's what's before that!

284
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,552
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Looking forward to it.

285
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,470
-What did you eat today?
-Today?

286
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,555
Pizza and--

287
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,222
-Pizza?
-I'm jealous.

288
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,225
Pizza and a burger.
Arisa made it for me.

289
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,186
Pizza.

290
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,146
Your weight doesn't matter?

291
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,317
My weight's fine.
I checked this morning and it was 64.2kg.

292
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,944
It has to be under 65kg.

293
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,655
It should be the same in the morning.

294
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,283
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

295
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,368
I've got an early morning,
I'm going to sleep.

296
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,662
-Me too.
-Good night.

297
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,665
-Good luck tomorrow, Arman.
-Thanks.

298
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,124
-Good night.
-Good night.

299
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,418
Good night.

300
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,588
It's tomorrow.

301
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,966
-Tomorrow.
-Yeah, it's tomorrow.

302
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,884
-It was a long road.
-Yeah.

303
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,596
You don't seem like you get nervous.

304
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,724
Before, about a week before a fight,

305
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,226
I got really nervous.

306
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,979
But this time, not at all.

307
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,981
-When was before?
-High school.

308
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
When I was in high school.

309
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,068
-But high school was a while ago.
-Yeah.

310
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,904
It's been four or five years
since my last match.

311
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,907
Is it time to sleep?

312
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,951
Should we go to sleep?

313
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,995
Do you have to leave earlier?

314
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,205
I'll leave around 8:00 a.m.

315
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,209
-I have to be there by 9:00 a.m.
-Oh, by 9:00 a.m.?

316
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,794
-Let's sleep.
-Yeah.

317
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,963
Thanks.

318
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,340
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

319
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,157
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

320
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,241
You're up early.

321
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,119
Sleep well?

322
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,997
-No. I'm still sleepy.
-Really?

323
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,708
Do you have time to eat breakfast?

324
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,253
-Breakfast.
-Breakfast?

325
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,048
It's probably better not to eat
before the weigh-in.

326
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,592
-Oh, that's right.
-I'll eat after the match.

327
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,343
-You will?
-Yeah.

328
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,767
I'm starting to get nervous now.

329
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,477
It's not good.

330
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,567
If you win, let's go anywhere
you want to go.

331
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,651
Sounds good.

332
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,819
You're gonna take me?

333
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,445
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

334
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,657
I'll take you wherever you want.

335
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,033
Okay. I'll think of where to go, then.

336
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,370
I'm going to win.

337
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,916
-I'd better go.
-I'll see you later.

338
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,167
Thank you.

00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,046
{\an8}<i>For our 70th second-class match,</i>
<i>two rounds of two minutes.</i>

346
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,924
{\an8}<i>In the red corner, we have Tony.</i>

347
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,469
<i>Blue corner, from Target Shibuya,</i>
<i>Arman Bitaraf.</i>

348
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,764
Go, Arman, go!

349
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,856
<i>Round one!</i>

350
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,136
{\an8}ITO TAKASHI
CEO OF TARGET

351
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,104
He's got it. Go, Arman!

352
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,898
Do your best, Arman!

353
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,984
<i>Second round.</i>

354
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,155
<i>Round two, final round!</i>

355
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,705
<i>We have a unanimous decision.</i>

356
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,667
Three to zero!

357
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,472
A certificate.

358
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,182
Can I see?

359
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,519
{\an8}CERTIFICATE OF HONOR
ARMAN BITARAF

360
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,772
{\an8}"Arman Bitaraf, for your win,

361
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,275
we present you with this certificate
in honor of your victory."

362
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,447
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

363
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,200
-What a relief.
-Yeah.

364
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,285
Finally.

365
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,954
You even refrained from drinking.

366
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,874
This morning,
you said you'd take me somewhere.

367
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,959
I did.

368
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,961
I want to go to Yomiuriland.

369
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,379
-The amusement park?
-Yeah.

370
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,131
You want to go to an amusement park?

371
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,968
-No roller coasters, though.
-You don't like roller coasters?

372
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,219
-You do?
-I do.

373
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,138
-You do?
-Let's do it.

374
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,475
We haven't taken a day trip
since Mt. Takao.

375
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,397
Congratulations!

376
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,399
Wow.

377
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,944
-It was three to zero.
-Amazing.

378
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,528
He's strong.

379
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,613
But he lost...

380
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,949
What?

381
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,576
It's very sad.
His opponent lost.

382
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,081
How can you root for a stranger?

383
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,166
Arisa has completely...

384
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,127
-fallen for him, right?
-Yeah.

385
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,213
She told him she'd take him anywhere.

386
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,175
Twice. "Anywhere you want."
She said it twice.

387
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,887
That means she wants to go
somewhere more adult.

388
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,723
She's giving the signal.

389
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,934
-She's including it.
-Yeah.

390
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:55,064
Mt. Takao, the amusement park,
and that kind of place. "Anywhere."

391
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,649
-Right?
-That's what she implied by that.

392
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,944
And if Arman had said something
that alluded to that,

393
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,779
she would've said, "You idiot."

394
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,241
"Idiot" meaning "yes."

395
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,534
-She didn't say no.
-No. "Idiot" means "yes."

396
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,828
Oh, watch out!

397
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:13,875
Oh, man,
so they're gonna get together, then.

398
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,251
You haven't given up yet?

399
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,504
Don't worry.
I've started to hate her.

400
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,547
Don't worry?

401
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,634
Yeah, I made sure of it.
I think I can move on now.

402
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,427
Did something happen?

403
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,930
I experienced passionate love.

404
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,558
You should cut your hair immediately.

405
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,228
So many feelings linger here!

406
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,563
Cut it immediately.

407
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,150
Yes, I'll get rid of these feelings.

408
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,112
-What about Minori and Tatsuya?
-That's right.

409
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,613
Surprising.

410
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,241
She said things were really awkward.

411
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,411
Tatsuya is much too serious.

412
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,748
The issue isn't whether they're going
to continue with <i>Terrace House,</i> right?

413
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,419
It's whether they get along as a couple.

414
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:05,217
When the topic turns serious,
they immediately disagree.

415
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,595
And the way Tatsuya communicates...

416
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,889
-Annoys her?
-...probably stresses her out.

417
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,100
You're told to say what's on your mind,

418
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,061
but when you do,
you're met with objections.

419
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,603
That's extremely annoying.

420
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,691
She does seem to be under a lot of stress.

421
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,693
It can't be controlled.

422
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,404
She's starting to get annoyed with him.

423
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,240
This is starting to get interesting.

424
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,952
That's terrible.

425
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,121
Enjoying other people's problems.

426
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,040
Feeding your hunger.

427
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,125
I've been pretty hungry lately.

428
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,173
{\an8}-I'm home.
-Welcome back!

429
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,799
Nice work!

430
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,261
This is fancy.

431
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,263
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

432
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,681
-Wow!
-Nice work, nice work.

433
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,142
Cheers!

434
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,145
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

435
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,481
Congratulations.

436
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,903
It tastes amazing.

437
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,616
-The long awaited...
-I've been waiting.

438
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,577
It's a victory dinner.
Let's get rowdy.

439
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,246
And a goodbye for you.

440
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,748
Me? Oh, yeah.

441
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,083
It's my last night.

442
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,542
We need to toast that, too.

443
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,670
Thanks for everything, Yuki.

444
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,008
You're stuttering!

445
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,426
That made me sad!

446
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,803
-Isn't the timing wrong?
-What?

447
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,639
I'm leaving, too.

448
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,224
When?

449
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,893
It could be at the same time.

450
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,021
I'm leaving tomorrow.

451
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,149
I'm going to drink until morning,
then go.

452
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,735
I don't have plans tomorrow,
so I'll join you.

453
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,986
Great.

454
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,302
Mizuki, good morning.

455
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,639
I have to leave early for work.

456
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,059
Thanks, Uchi.

457
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,601
Come by for a haircut.

458
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,728
See you later.

459
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,066
-Thank you. I'll see you.
-Thank you.

460
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,567
See you later.

461
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,071
Yuki.

462
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,656
Your face is a mess.

463
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,617
Your face is a mess.

464
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,662
-I'm heading out for work.
-Okay.

465
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,665
-See you around.
-See you.

466
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,250
I don't know when I'll see you again.

467
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,882
{\an8}Thanks for these past four months.

468
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,967
I had fun.

469
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,761
Thank you very much.

470
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,599
Thank you very much.

471
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,683
Thank you.

472
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,768
Thank you to you.

473
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,189
-Shall we?
-Shall we?

474
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,358
Jinx!

475
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,818
{\an8}-Okay, let's go. See ya.
-Let's go!

476
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,946
Thanks, Minori!

477
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,074
Thank you!

478
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,077
-See you.
-See you.

479
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,454
-See ya!
-See you.

480
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,706
Thank you, bye!

481
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,583
-Bon voyage.
-Thanks, I'm off!

482
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,668
See you later!

483
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,593
Thank you for everything.
