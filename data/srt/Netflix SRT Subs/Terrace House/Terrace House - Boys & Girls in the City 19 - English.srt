1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,389
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,685
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,313
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,066
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,151
There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,277
Yes.

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,156
Well, everyone,
we have a new member in the studio today.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,658
That's right.

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,451
-The actor Kentaro.
-Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,411
-Kentaro!
-Kentaro!

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,913
KENTARO, ACTOR

13
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,039
-Welcome.
-Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,083
-Your skin is so smooth!
-Yeah!

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,460
-You're 18 years old, right?
-Yes, 18.

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,420
It's like bring it on 4K!

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,049
He's made for 4K.

18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,511
-Have you seen all the episodes?
-From the beginning.

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,097
From when Yu was in the car.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,975
I guess he watched that.

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,895
Do you have a favorite girl
in the group by any chance?

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,774
Right now, Arisa.

23
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,234
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD,
HAT DESIGNER

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,070
-Oh, her.
-It's that one, is it?

25
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,447
What does that mean?

26
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,660
Well, you know,
it's a predictable choice.

27
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,122
It's not like you're wrong.

28
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,583
It was just, "Oh, Kentaro likes her, too."

29
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,627
That's our opinion anyway.

30
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,087
You too, right, Yamachan?

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,590
I did, but I've already moved on.

32
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,386
You have? You've moved on?

33
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,681
She's just different
from the Arisa I imagined.

34
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,350
So, I'm sorry, but I had to move on.

35
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,562
Kentaro, you haven't developed
a discerning eye for women yet.

36
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,230
-I'll teach you today.
-Thank you.

37
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,356
Today?

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,233
So, previously...

39
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,985
Arman and Arisa are already set, right?

40
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,069
That's right.

41
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,573
He was throwing up, and she likes him?
She must be crazy.

42
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,408
Is it good?

43
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,536
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,330
-It looks warm.
-It's super warm.

45
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,917
I wasn't expecting a gift at all.

46
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,420
I'm so happy.
Thank you.

47
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,588
<i>So, he's going to ask her, right?</i>

48
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,758
-On Christmas.
-So, maybe we'll get to see that today.

49
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,092
There's gonna be a kiss.

50
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,844
-Probably.
-Yeah.

51
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,513
I think it's a bad idea
if they become an item at this point.

52
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,557
I don't think they'll last long.

53
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,393
That's what you're hoping for.

54
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,562
Will Minori and Tatsuya be leaving?

55
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,816
-Things were awkward, but they made up.
-They talked.

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,654
All our talks get too serious.

57
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,741
I think that's why I tend to clam up.

58
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,243
Well, I think disagreements are important,

59
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,828
but I do want things to stay enjoyable.

60
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,830
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD
TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

61
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,416
In the Japanese-style room, they spent
the night and worked things out.

62
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,462
<i>-Yes, the Bedroom Solution.</i>
<i>-Bedroom Solution?</i>

63
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,298
-Oh, and new members!
-That's right.

64
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,550
Why did you decide
to move in to <i>Terrace House?</i>

65
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,470
Mainly because I thought it'd be fun.

66
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,638
Simple as that.

67
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:05,227
I have been without a boyfriend
for about a year.

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,604
So maybe...

69
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,731
Would that be too good to be true?

70
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,443
A manly blue-collar-type guy.

71
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,028
Scary.

72
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,656
And someone from the Kansai region.

73
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,574
-A beautiful profile.
-Yes.

74
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,369
-Beautiful straight teeth.
-She did have nice straight teeth!

75
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,162
Oh, I love straight teeth.

76
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,748
Oh, so now we've got someone
that fits your criteria.

77
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:32,504
Also, <i>Terrace House</i>
has been extended for 18 weeks.

78
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,549
For a total of 36 weeks.

79
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,342
-There will be more to come.
-Wonderful!

80
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,137
Another 18 weeks?
A lot can happen.

81
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,148
SHINBASHI, TOKYO

82
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,068
-Well... cheers!
-Cheers!

83
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,154
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

84
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:02,868
Delicious.

85
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,997
-The amusement park was fun.
-It was.

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,708
I'm sorry about what happened though.

87
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,920
It'll be in my memories forever.

88
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,047
Really.

89
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,718
-In a good way?
-Yeah, in a good way.

90
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,222
There's some place I want to take you.

91
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,348
It's within walking distance.

92
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,767
Let's go after.

93
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,935
-Near here?
-Yeah, it's walkable.

94
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,397
-Do you have time?
-Totally.

95
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,983
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

96
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,276
From me to you.

97
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,196
A Christmas gift to show my appreciation.

98
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:42,908
You're like Santa!

99
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,703
Nothing extravagant, but...

100
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,079
Thank you.

101
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,665
-Can I open it?
-Please do.

102
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,461
It's a scarf.

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,962
-I wasn't sure about black...
-Yay!

104
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,047
Sorry if you already have one.

105
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,840
I don't have a black one.
Not in this style, either.

106
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,967
-I'm glad.
-Thank you.

107
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,052
Yay!

108
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,055
I hope you like it.

109
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,723
Thank you. I'm so happy!

110
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,434
Ta-da!

111
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,853
-Wow.
-Amazing, right?

112
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,773
CARETTA SHIODOME

113
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,733
It's so pretty.

114
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,026
Wow.

115
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,278
So pretty.

116
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,197
-Reminds me of the amusement park.
-Yeah.

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,074
I'm actually alive this time.

118
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,827
Do you want me to take it?

119
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,620
Let's take one together.

120
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,498
Wow, it's really pretty.

121
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,628
How'd it turn out?

122
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,047
Wow.

123
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,300
Oh, they take a picture for you.

124
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,013
-Wow, it's nice.
-It's beautiful.

125
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,157
-Amazing.
-Right?

126
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,869
You can see all of Tokyo!

127
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,080
Wanna sit?

128
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,208
Oh, there's a place to sit?

129
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,507
You remember at Yomiuriland last time?

130
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,511
There was something I wanted to say then,
but I was sick and all.

131
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,471
You were.

132
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,973
So, I couldn't say it then.

133
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,477
I really like you right now.

134
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,527
Will you be my girlfriend?

135
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,995
I know it's sudden.

136
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,352

139
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:29,407
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD,
HAT DESIGNER

140
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,044
We've been spending
a lot of time together lately

141
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,046
and going to lots of places.

142
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,884
Living together,
I've given it some thought,

143
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,260
but...

144
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:56,685
I'm comfortable with you,
and I have fun, but...

145
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,900
I don't want to change
the relationship we have now.

146
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,235
That's how I feel.

147
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,154
I'm...

148
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,615
sorry.

149
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,411
It's like...

150
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,873
Family? Brother? Like friends...

151
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,962
The more we hung out,

152
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,339
the more my feelings tilted that way,
I guess.

153
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,511
I understand.

154
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,722
Thanks.

155
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,604
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm glad I know how you feel.

156
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,739
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

157
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,667
-Wow.
-The unexpected.

158
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,670
-What's going on? This is fun.
-Here it is.

159
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,756
This is it.

160
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,050
Mr. Yamasato? What's going on?

161
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,887
She's a cunning and wily girl.

162
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,724
That was close. She almost had me.

163
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,603
What do you mean? She totally had you!

164
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,354
Man, that was a close one!

165
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,483
What do you mean close? She had you!

166
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,611
You fell for her already.

167
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,987
She played him.

168
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,741
I think this one shocked all of us.

169
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,367
Are you surprised, Kentaro?

170
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,203
-They went hiking together, right?
-Yes.

171
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,622
They held hands like this.

172
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,416
-The normal clasp.
-And now it was intertwined.

173
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,337
-You've got a good eye.
-Good job, Kentaro. Good eye.

174
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,590
That was... a bit of a surprise.

175
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,802
I mean, Arman was planning on kissing her.

176
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,929
She walked away at the sound of the bell.

177
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,639
Things were going well until then.

178
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:03,728
So Arman, rather naturally, holds her hand
and puts his arms around her.

179
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,106
It seemed like Arisa was thinking,
"Oh, is that a Hawaiian thing?

180
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,777
Girls in Japan might read more into it."

181
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,614
It seemed like Arman
was the stronger force.

182
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,118
But she was deftly letting his actions go.

183
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,452
That's right.

184
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,830
Not just that, but going above and beyond.

185
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,958
-Amazing. It's aikido.
-It is aikido.

186
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
It is aikido!

187
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,547
Kickboxing versus aikido.
Aikido wins.

188
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,467
She just blocked all the punches.

189
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,428
Arman thought he was in, but he wasn't.

190
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,765
What is she trying to do? This girl...

191
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,101
What's she trying to do?

192
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,981
It's so absurd!

193
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
There are girls like this from Kagoshima?

194
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,736
There are different types of people.

195
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,697
She's probably being nice.

196
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,157
Maybe she's just too accepting?

197
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,575
Holding hands and all that.

198
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,286
-No, no, no...
-There are girls like that.

199
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,747
No, no.
It's fine to accept it.

200
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,128
But to lead someone on,
that's the crime.

201
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,257
If she means she wants to see
how things go

202
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,468
and to take things slower,
that's understandable.

203
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,887
-Exactly.
-That's right.

204
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,431
But she wants things to stay the same?

205
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,392
-She said like friends or family.
-She said family, like siblings.

206
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,479
So, she's saying she doesn't want
to be anything more than friends.

207
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,315
It was like the Costco incident.

208
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,817
Like the way she rejected Tap.

209
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,320
"Let's go to Costco with everyone."

210
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,405
"With everyone, everyone."

211
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:42,327
If she was going to reject him,
she should've just used Costco again.

212
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,745
-So true.
-Yeah.

213
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,539
<i>Costco</i> was there for the taking.

214
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,750
Yeah, she might as well have said,

215
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,711
"Forget that, let's go to Costco."
And bam!

216
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,507
Then she still would've been horrible,
but funny at least.

217
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,384
Yeah, then I'd even forget my anger.

218
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,446
Uchi.

219
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,451
Uchi.

220
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,577
You awake?

221
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,997
Can you hang with me, like, five minutes?

222
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,374
Sorry.

223
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,250
Just for one drink?

224
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,174
What's up?
Just five minutes?

225
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,051
First off, Merry Christmas.

226
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
Merry Christmas.

227
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,941
We had dinner.

228
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,194
And went to see the illumination<i>.</i>

229
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,821
-With Arisa?
-Yeah.

230
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,699
We were holding hands like usual.

231
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,785
-Holding hands?
-Yeah.

232
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,038
And then she said she could only see me

233
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,209
as a friend or brother.

234
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,752
Then why is she holding hands?

235
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,212
That's what I don't get.

236
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,756
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

237
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,301
Arisa's at fault then, I think.

238
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,888
Why would you hold hands
if you're not interested?

239
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:30,435
So, she's not saying that she's not ready,

240
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,772
but that she doesn't see you
that way at all?

241
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,065
Yeah.

242
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,234
That's crazy,
who holds hands with family?

243
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,819
Right?

244
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,989
You wouldn't hold hands with a brother.

245
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,410
She said she doesn't want
to ruin our relationship.

246
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,287
What?

247
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,581
That's a little...

248
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,709
That's bad on Arisa's part.

249
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,962
-She's just leading you on, then.
-A little.

250
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:04,385
So he asked, and you rejected him?

251
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,470
Is that right?

252
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,269
I said I wanted things to stay
as they were.

253
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,104
As friends.

254
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,900
That's what I told him.

255
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,487
I don't know how Arman feels.

256
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,531
Come in.

257
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,244
Can I come in?

258
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,124
I wanted to talk to you.

259
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,298
Did you hear what happened?

260
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,508
Yeah, I heard.

261
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,219
Did you hear from Arman?

262
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,472
Yeah, and I was wondering how you felt?

263
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:56,604
It's true that I felt something
more than friendship for him,

264
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,274
but to have a relationship with him?

265
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,320
-Is something else?
-That's something else.

266
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,450
That's how I feel.

267
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:15,915
If that's the case,
why did you hold hands with him?

268
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,378
It's not as though I didn't like...

269
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,590
holding hands with Arman today.

270
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,759
And I did think...

271
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,971
that he might ask me today.

272
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:37,103
Maybe it's easier to hold hands
since I don't have those feelings for him.

273
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,814
Yeah, I don't get that.

274
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,526
There's no need to say that.

275
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,612
-Yeah, but...
-You know...

276
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,281
It's Christmas.

277
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,617
You're surrounded by beautiful lights.

278
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,870
You're holding hands.

279
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,790
And then be told you're like a brother?

280
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,375
Wouldn't that make you say, "What?"

281
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,754
Wouldn't it? I don't know.

282
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,047
It would.

283
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,009
Yeah, but there's nothing to be done now.

284
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,178
That's what happened,

285
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:14,056
and she can't lie to herself
and go out with him.

286
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,185
Then I wish you hadn't held his hand.

287
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,023
It's misleading.

288
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,069
Maybe that's just you trying to be nice,

289
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,906
but it seems like you were leading him on.

290
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,699
You're right.

291
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,245
I enjoyed hanging out with Arman.

292
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,917
I had fun.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,377
And I wanted to get to know him.

294
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,005
But...

295
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,135
I shouldn't have held hands
with him today.

296
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:56,182
Though it's not like I didn't want to.
I mean, I do like him.

297
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,477
But...

298
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,982
But I should have said no.

299
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,988
I do think that I hurt him.

300
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,700
Arman?

301
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,214
Arman?

302
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,299
What?

303
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,552
I didn't explain myself yesterday.

304
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,803
-Not now.
-What?

305
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,471
Not now, please.

306
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,831
Cleaning Duties
Women: Dining, 2nd Floor Girls' room

307
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,166
Men: Living room, Guys room, Game room

308
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,292
Uchi & Minori: Japanese-style room

309
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,502
Have you talked to Arisa?

310
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,463
No, not yet.

311
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,049
She came to see me this morning.

312
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,843
Like, in my room.

313
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,431
She came to your room?

314
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,976
She said something, but I was sleeping.

315
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,020
And I didn't feel like talking.

316
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,938
It was just too much of a hassle.

317
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,400
Have your feelings for her cooled?

318
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,610
Is it too soon?

319
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,906
Just depends on how you look at it.

320
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,532
Things are a little awkward then?

321
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,950
-A little.
-A little.

322
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,579
So, he's hurt.

323
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,582
And won't talk to you?

324
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,922
What was the reason you rejected him?

325
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,425
I didn't want to say
I still had feelings for him.

326
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,805
I figured that would just lead him on.

327
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:45,017
So, I could only say I was not into
being his girlfriend.

328
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,813
I think it's okay to tell him...

329
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,817
that you had feelings for him.

330
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,861
If you think that'll hurt him or whatever,

331
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,116
then he'll never know
what you were thinking.

332
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,368
I think it'd be better if you said,

333
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,121
"This is how I felt,
and that's why I held your hand."

334
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,082
I think it'll help Arman accept things.

335
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,584
That's true.

336
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,547
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

337
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,923
But, he hasn't so far.

338
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,218
If you try again and he doesn't listen,

339
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,555
then I think
that's pretty immature of him.

340
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,642
What should I do if he doesn't?

341
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,403
-Good work, guys.
-Good work.

342
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,197
Uchi, let's go clean
the Japanese-style room.

343
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,699
Okay.

344
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,284
Let's do.

345
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,746
Where's my phone?

346
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,707
-Can I help, too?
-Sure, thanks.

347
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,670
-Japanese-style room?
-Yeah.

348
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,301
I wanted to talk to you.

349
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,262
You came to my room, right?

350
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,722
And I was sleeping.

351
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,434
I was pretending to sleep
because I didn't feel like talking.

352
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,395
I'm okay now, though.

353
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,023
I was a little down.

354
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:20,613
Not because I was rejected...

355
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,116
but because you said we're like siblings.

356
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,996
Maybe you were just trying not to hurt me,

357
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,794
but that's the worst thing
you can say to a guy.

358
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,504
So, I was a little upset about that.

359
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,842
There are lots of things
I didn't get to say. Um...

360
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,928
Do you want to sit and talk?

361
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,554
Yeah, let's sit.

362
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,807
We can do this later.

363
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,645
I...

364
00:21:54,104 --> 00:22:00,861
I'm not ready for a relationship now,
but it's not that I don't like...

365
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,074
So, you don't think of me as a sibling?

366
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,036
Well, I have lots of
different feelings about you.

367
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,414
But, since I don't want a relationship,

368
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,670
I didn't want to give an ambiguous answer.

369
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,630
I thought that would be wrong.

370
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:24,051
I'd rather you give it to me straight,
my feelings aside.

371
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,011
Just say what you're really thinking.

372
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,763
What you're saying right now
doesn't make any sense to me.

373
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,184
Are you saying it's too fast for you?

374
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,146
That you want to date and then see?

375
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,149
Or are you not interested in me?

376
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,527
Which is it?

377
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,613
I don't want to waste your time either.

378
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,199
And I don't want to waste my time.

379
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,534
So...

380
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,328
I like you.

381
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,165
That's why I wanted to go places with you.

382
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,044
I do want to get to know you...

383
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,879
better.

384
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,548
I understand.

385
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,513
I'm sorry I didn't communicate it well.

386
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,268
-Shall we continue cleaning?
-Let's clean.

387
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,731
It's late already.

388
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,983
-We're not going to finish.
-I want ramen.

389
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,318
I'm hungry.

390
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,039
Where's Uchi?

391
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,083
-Uchi left already.
-Oh, I see.

392
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,922
He probably didn't sleep.

393
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,299
-Yesterday?
-Yesterday.

394
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,638
-Morning.
-Sleepy?

395
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,390
-I'm going.
-You're leaving?

396
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,267
You're not leaving yet?

397
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,393
Day after tomorrow.

398
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,020
-Day after tomorrow?
-Oh, I see.

399
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,398
What does it say for you?

400
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,692
My cousin's house.

401
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,030
Oh, Uchi is going home on the 31st.

402
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,782
-Have a good New Year's.
-See you next year.

403
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,244
-Have fun with just the boys.
-Just the boys.

404
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,247
-Bye.
-Bye!

405
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,922
I don't get it!

406
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,385
I don't know now.

407
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,845
Which is it?

408
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,640
I don't know. That time...

409
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,685
she just didn't say it right.

410
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,312
So, she didn't reject him?

411
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,941
She just didn't explain herself.

412
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,695
She just didn't feel ready
for a relationship.

413
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,029
Perhaps.

414
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:54,326
I don't know, but Arisa
was sort of told that by everyone.

415
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,913
-So, maybe she's just confused.
-In a panic?

416
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,164
You really think so?

417
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,875
I agree with you.
She's not that type.

418
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,460
She gets what's going on.

419
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,713
That's right. She knows the deal,

420
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,633
but since people are on to her,
she is making things vague.

421
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,719
"I do like him, but..."

422
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,221
"It's not like I rejected him, but..."

423
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,266
"So, let's leave it like this for now."

424
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,353
"I don't really understand either."

425
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,814
"So, for now..."
Is what she means right?

426
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,317
-Exactly.
-That is possible.

427
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,946
I was annoyed when she said,
"Have a good New Year's."

428
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,490
My New Year's day is ruined thanks to you.

429
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,453
HATSUMODE

430
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,937
Hey.

431
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,481
-Welcome home.
-I'm back.

432
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,817
-Alone?
-Alone.

433
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,986
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

434
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,573
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

435
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,326
That's a lot of luggage.

436
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,536
-It's Uchi's.
-Oh, I see.

437
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,207
Where's Uchi?

438
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,792
-At work.
-Oh, at work.

439
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,959
Where's Arisa?

440
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,670
-I think she's at work.
-Really?

441
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,089
How was your vacation?

442
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,927
My vacation? I went home...
and just chilled.

443
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,804
-Nice.
-I did nothing.

444
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,033
Did you see Arisa?

445
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,577
I haven't.
I haven't talked to her at all.

446
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,163
-I haven't kept in touch.
-You haven't?

447
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:08,168
I was initiating everything before,
so I thought I'd give her some space.

448
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,421
-Why? You've talked it out, right?
-I suppose.

449
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,674
Did you meet with Uchi?

450
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,926
He stayed with me
since he doesn't have a place.

451
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,721
That's why I have his luggage.

452
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,974
That's nice. So lovey-dovey.

453
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,393
Oh, stop.

454
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,811
I'm jealous.

455
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,944
Who is it?

456
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,821
-They're here.
-They're here.

457
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,947
It's them for sure.

458
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,870
There's only two of us here.

459
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,330
-Come in.
-Come in.

460
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,999
<i>From today onwards, I'll be staying.</i>

461
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,208
What?

462
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,835
-Come in.
<i>-Yes.</i>

463
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,551
-A guy.
-Yeah.

464
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,221
-Definitely not 20.
-Wasn't his voice really low?

465
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,433
It's nerve-racking.

466
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,894
It's more nerve-racking waiting.

467
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,438
Nice to meet you.

468
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,607
-Hi.
-Hi.

469
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,483
I'm Hikaru Ota.

470
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,652
It's nice to meet you.

471
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,654
I was so nervous.

472
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,865
It's just the two of us here.
Nice to meet you.

473
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,867
-Nice to meet you.
-Please sit.

474
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,038
Excuse me.

475
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,626
What was your name again?

476
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,711
Hikaru Ota. Call me Hikaru.

477
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,046
How old are you?

478
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,840
-I'm 18.
-For real?

479
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,343
-I'm 18.
-A student?

480
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,345
I'm not a student.

481
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,015
I model and act.

482
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,893
And I do construction on the side.

483
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,311
HIKARU OTA, 18 YEARS OLD,
MODEL, CONSTRUCTION WORKER

484
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,230
I also do construction.

485
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,357
-Are you half-Japanese?
-I am.

486
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,275
Me too.

487
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,985
-From where?
-Iranian and Japanese.

488
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,070
You?

489
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,072
-Italian and Japanese.
-I see.

490
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,408
-But I grew up in Brazil.
-Brazil? Why?

491
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:08,622
Well, my mother and father
met at a university in Brazil.

492
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,792
They married and had me there.

493
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,877
But my ethnicity is Italian and Japanese.

494
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,379
How long did you live in Brazil?

495
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,923
Until two years old.
So, I grew up mainly here.

496
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,633
Do you do any sports?

497
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,802
I kickbox for fun.

498
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,012
-I box.
-Seriously?

499
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,808
Boxing and I've played soccer
for a long time.

500
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,061
I played with a team called Santos
in Brazil, studying abroad.

501
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,272
But I'm down to just boxing now.

502
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,898
They have gloves here.

503
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,650
-Gloves?
-Downstairs.

504
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,819
-What?
-Yeah, Minori does it sometimes, too.

505
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,656
-Yeah, he teaches me.
-You do it here? Really?

506
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,410
-I'd love to join you for practice.
-Sure.

507
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,036
-Looking forward to it.
-Lucky you.

508
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,997
Sounds like you'll get along.

509
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,875
-Girlfriend?
-No girlfriend.

510
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,168
What's your type?

511
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,546
Mature.

512
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,048
Well, I've only dated older women.

513
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,218
So, someone mature.

514
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:09,016
And I like to stay active,
so someone outdoorsy.

515
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:14,021
I like having fun,
so someone who'll let me do anything.

516
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,856
Someone understanding.

517
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,025
Seriously?

518
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,235
Another member.

519
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,112
Is that what it means?

520
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,824
-That bell means a new member?
-A new member.

521
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,618
-That was quick.
-Really?

522
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,039
-It hasn't settled in yet.
-The other two are gonna be so surprised.

523
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,582
Hi.

524
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,418
<i>Hi, I'm supposed to start living here.</i>

525
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,337
For real? The same timing?

526
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,005
-Please come in!
-Come in.

527
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,896
Think she's the sexy type
or the cute type?

528
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,314
Wasn't her voice cute?

529
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,984
-Hello.
-I can't see her face.

530
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,820
-Hello.
-Hello.

531
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,282
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

532
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,493
It's nice to meet you.

533
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,291
-Wow.
-What's your name?

534
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,794
-I'm Natsumi Saito.
-Ms. Natsumi.

535
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,962
-How old are you?
-I'm 26 years old.

536
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,006
-He just arrived too.
-I just got here.

537
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,050
Really?

538
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,761
-Are you from the Kansai region?
-From Osaka.

539
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,845
I see.

540
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,891
-How old are you?
-I'm 18.

541
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,519
So young! No way.

542
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,978
What do you do for work?

543
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,355
My job?

544
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,273
I'm a model.

545
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,864
I'm studying to be an actress.

546
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,116
It's what I hope to be.

547
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,575
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD,
MODEL, ASPIRING ACTRESS

548
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,703
This is sudden,
but do you have a boyfriend?

549
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,414
No, I don't.

550
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,375
It's been about a year.

551
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,629
What type of guy do you like?

552
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,133
Someone manly, I think.

553
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,683
Do people have real relationships here?

554
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,437
-Yeah.
-Watching it on TV...

555
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,107
I was wondering
if you really fall for each other.

556
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,733
That's a question for her.

557
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,318
You've got someone too, Arman.

558
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,903
She likes you back?

559
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,947
That's what I thought anyway.

560
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,826
-I see.
-That's where it's at.

561
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,538
Do you want to find love here?

562
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,332
I'm not in a rush.

563
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,002
I think love should come naturally.

564
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,046
But I would like to.

565
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,008
Of course.

566
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,470
-I hope so, too.
-Yes.

567
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,598
But I'm the youngest.

568
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,891
18, huh...

569
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,476
I usually drink by myself.

570
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,687
-Do you like to drink?
-Yes, do you?

571
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,606
-I love it.
-Let's drink together, then.

572
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,234
So, there's two more?

573
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,446
So, now there's six of us?

574
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,490
Yes, we're six now.
