1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,931
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,642
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,226
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,979
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,607
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,693
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,612
Previously,

8
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,157
-Minori and Tatsuya's relationship...
-That's right!

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,910
-...is in an awkward state.
-Awkward.

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,162
The show was extended, right?

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,415
We hadn't really discussed our plans.

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,626
{\an8}Well, when we talk about it...

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,086
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,588
{\an8}...it gets really heavy.

15
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,424
It becomes really negative.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,260
It's a difference in thought...

17
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,304
I think.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>An issue of mismatched personalities?</i>

19
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:01,019
Or did something happen
in that Japanese-style room?

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,021
Bedroom issues.

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,357
Bedroom issues?

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,819
You don't know
who to go to for bedroom issues.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,863
Qracian can't help with this.

24
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,573
-They can only help with plumbing issues.
-That's right.

25
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,075
-Bed-cian.
-Bed-cian?

26
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,327
Bed-cian? That's like...

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,412
Bedroom problems?

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,164
That's like a call girl service.

29
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,042
Come this way, Ayumu.

30
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,293
I apologize for that one.

31
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,964
-And, Arman--
-Arman won his match!

32
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,676
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,263
{\an8}<i>We have a unanimous decision.</i>

34
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,891
{\an8}Hooray!

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,395
{\an8}They made plans to go to Yomiuriland
on a date.

36
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,858
The reason for their date,
"If you win, I'll take you anywhere."

37
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,359
There's probably going to be a kiss
at Yomiuriland.

38
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,568
Wow!

39
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,656
Yomiuriland will be all lit up!

40
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,782
That's right!

41
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,285
-It's that time of year!
-It's really pretty.

42
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,038
-Definitely a kiss, then.
-Yeah, for sure.

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,373
I hope she realizes it's just LED.

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,877
And Mizuki and Tap left.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,630
{\an8}<i>-Yes, they left.</i>
<i>-Thank you, guys.</i>

46
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,214
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD
YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD

47
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,299
And so...

48
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,134
-Oh, yes!
-That's right!

49
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,469
-New members.
-Are coming today?

50
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,305
Are you telling us
if they're coming today?

51
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,431
I can't say yet.

52
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,391
No? That means they're coming.

53
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,726
Yeah, that's definitely yes.

54
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,483
{\an8}TENGENJI GARDEN CAFE

55
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,405
{\an8}TENGENJI GARDEN
HIROO, TOKYO

56
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
{\an8}Hey.

57
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,325
{\an8}KURUMI NAKADA, 23 YEARS OLD,
MODEL, MINORI'S OLDER SISTER

58
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,576
{\an8}Sorry I'm late.

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,661
It's fine.

60
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,495
I thought Uchi would be here.

61
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,997
-I was looking forward to it.
-Why?

62
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,917
"Hi, I'm Minori's boyfriend, Uchihara."

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,001
You wanted him to say that?

64
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,921
It would've been funny.

65
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,881
Nothing's changed.

66
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,883
Nothing?
Since you got together?

67
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,551
Nothing's happened?

68
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,845
Like going out?

69
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,264
He doesn't have too much time off.

70
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,100
Any new couples?

71
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,310
-Oh, Mizuki left.
-What?

72
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,980
Mizuki and Yuki left.

73
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,522
Really?

74
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,899
Arisa came, right?

75
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,401
And Arman...

76
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,028
Arisa snatched him?

77
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,823
-So, Mizuki left?
-Yeah.

78
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,366
-Professor Tap, too?
-Yeah.

79
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,409
That's tough on Professor Tap.

80
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,578
Nothing happened for him.

81
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,248
Do you decorate in Kagoshima, too?

82
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,707
-What?
-In Kagoshima.

83
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,295
We've never had such a big tree at home.

84
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,091
I'm all tangled.

85
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,425
Did you decorate in Hawaii?

86
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,970
Everyone does,
but I've never done it.

87
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,224
Christmas this year is a little different.

88
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,433
Yeah, it's different.

89
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,353
What did you do last Christmas?

90
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,023
-I had dinner with friends.
-Dinner with friends?

91
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,901
And you?

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,654
Right before Christmas,
I broke up with my ex.

93
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,073
That's the worst Christmas.

94
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,283
Yeah.

95
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,702
What are you doing for Christmas
this year?

96
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,580
This year?

97
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,332
I only have plans for the 25th.

98
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,084
Oh, so you're free?

99
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,961
-The 24th.
-You're free on the 24th?

100
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,421
Leave it open, then.

101
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,631
-The 24th?
-Yeah.

102
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,050
Let's go somewhere.

103
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,677
-The amusement park?
-No.

104
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,012
That's Sunday.

105
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,764
-This week?
-This Sunday.

106
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,809
-The 20th?
-Yeah.

107
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,270
I was wondering when we'd go.

108
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,480
Done!

109
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,441
Finished!

110
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,903
-Looks good.
-Yeah.

111
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,988
What a glamorous tree.

112
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,240
-Ready?
-Yeah.

113
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,993
Oh, it's on.

114
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,997
-It's so pretty.
-It's pretty.

115
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,248
It's really pretty.

116
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,001
Congrats!

117
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,798
So, basically,
it's two couples living together.

118
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,343
I don't know what's actually going on
with Arman and Arisa, though.

119
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,179
You mean everyone's just saying that?

120
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,890
That's good, though.
You should just change rooms.

121
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,852
Did you know
there's a Japanese-style room?

122
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,437
-Toward the back?
-Yeah.

123
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,522
They said it can be our room.

124
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,607
What?

125
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,194
-So, we've been sleeping there.
-The two of you?

126
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,617
Does it feel
like you're in a relationship?

127
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,411
-No.
-No? Why?

128
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,872
You're sleeping together.

129
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,458
We live together,
so I know he's coming back.

130
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,212
So, I don't really worry about
what time he's coming home.

131
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,047
Is it just because we live there?

132
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,258
-If we left...
-Most likely.

133
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,928
So, Uchi might ask you to leave with him.

134
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,264
We haven't really discussed that.

135
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,057
-You should talk about it.
-Yeah.

136
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,643
I know, but we kind of argued about it.

137
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,229
-You fought? You fought about it?
-We didn't fight, per se.

138
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,189
"Living here, it's fun,

139
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:00,235
but we should be doing
something more meaningful."

140
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,487
-That's what he told me.
-Is this an after school activity?

141
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,866
What should be a simple talk turns heavy.

142
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,368
Wonder why?

143
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,203
He's the one who said, "It's soba"
while eating soba.

144
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,748
-It was so simple.
-Yeah.

145
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,918
We'd say, "Cow!" when we saw a cow.

146
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,922
No make-up kisses?

147
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,091
-No.
-No make-up sex?

148
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,884
It's not like that.

149
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,261
Wait, it hasn't happened?

150
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,471
Since going out?

151
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,183
-We have.
-You have? Good.

152
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,019
-I was worried Uchi was still a virgin.
-That was your worry?

153
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:39,816
Well, you know, sometimes
your fights don't really matter after sex.

154
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,818
Your voice is too loud.

155
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,611
Stop, this is embarrassing!

156
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,779
No?

Let's go see it.

163
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,837
Yeah, let's go.

The 22nd?

165

The 22nd.

166
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,218
I'm off Tuesday.

167
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,303
You can't?

168
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,929
I can.

169
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,223
I'm free the whole day.

170
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,517
No plans.

171
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,352
Even though it's your birthday?

172
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,813
Well, now that Miss Minori has invited me
to <i>Star Wars...</i>

173
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,399
-What are you doing?
-Yo!

174
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,941
Don't "yo" me.

175
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,281
I had lunch with my sister today.

176
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,242
What did she say?

177
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,203
She asked if we're leaving together.

178
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,746
I don't know.

179
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,623
Well...

180
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,711
To be honest, right now,

181
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,965
I do think that this house,
this environment,

182
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,137
makes things convenient for us
to a certain degree.

183
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,430
-I think--
-What do you mean?

184
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,516
How well our relationship is going.

185
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,975
Do you ever think about that?

186
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,687
-You mean if it wasn't like this?
-Yeah.

187
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,858
If we can't see each other so easily.

188
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,403
-We'll eventually leave.
-Yeah, but...

189
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,826
I feel like we'll suddenly be too distant
from each other if we left now.

190
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,456
Maybe it's selfish of me,
but this place works for us.

191
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,168
I understand.

192
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,588
But if you say you want to leave,
I'll go, too.

193
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,592
If you're not here, there's no point.

194
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,762
But if we leave together,
it's like I came to just find a boyfriend.

195
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,099
There's nothing wrong with that.

196
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,102
I don't really want to be seen that way.

197
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,937
I totally came to find a girlfriend.

198
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,190
-That's right!
-I announced that already.

199
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,524
That's right.

200
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,445
We haven't talked like this in a while.

201
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,323
We haven't talked like this in a while.

202
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,994
-We don't usually talk so much.
-Yeah, we don't.

203
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,122
We don't talk often.

204
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,789
Usually.

205
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,877
-We both don't talk.
-That's not totally true.

206
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,254
There's no conversation.

207
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:54,802
All our talks get too serious.

208
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,347
Just look at our past conversations.

209
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,518
I don't find that fun.

210
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,523
I think that's why I tend to clam up.

211
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,319
Well, I think disagreements are important,

212
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,072
but I do want things to stay enjoyable.

213
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:19,202
You're right, though.
I've been too serious lately.

214
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,791
I'm sorry--

215
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,085
If we can discuss things like this,
I'll be happy.

216
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,841
We'll talk things through
and enjoy our relationship.

217
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,804
If you can understand that,
then I'm happy, and it'll be okay.

218
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,934
-Okay?
-Well, I meant it would make me happy.

219
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,438
-I look forward to the relationship.
-Thank you.

220
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:09,794
While Arman and Arisa were decorating,
it got a little risqué. From behind...

221
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,045
with the tree.

222
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,755
You mean like this?

223
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,675
Pulling the tree along, too?

224
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,762
He's using his martial arts all wrong.

225
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,225
They're like Minori and Uchi
before they started going out.

226
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,937
If one person admits anything,
it won't stop.

227
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,566
It already seems like it's happening.

228
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,651
Yeah, like when he asked her out
for Christmas.

229
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,819
Like, it was natural.

230
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,656
If you ask someone out for Christmas,
that's saying you like them, right?

231
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,284
I mean, it's a special day.

232
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,621
Asking someone to keep that day open
is like asking for a relationship.

233
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,414
I wouldn't say a relationship,

234
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,583
but that you want to spend time with them.

235
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,793
So, if you're okay with that,

236
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,381
then you're okay
with a relationship, right?

237
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,217
-Well, maybe in this case.
-Yeah.

238
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,388
-And Kurumi's great, isn't she?
-She is.

239
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,056
She's great. So blunt.

240
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,225
Well, it looks like...

241
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,144
they were able to talk.

242
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,812
Was that progress?

243
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,649
It's getting better little by little.

244
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,236
So, if this talk was better than usual,

245
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,822
how boring is their usual, then?

246
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,243
They did say
that normally they don't talk.

247
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,246
Yeah, why would he say that?

248
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,501
Tatsuya just wanted to say
that he didn't want to leave

249
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,711
because he wouldn't be able to see
Minori as often.

250
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,129
-But--
-The way he said it.

251
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,173
Yeah, it's the way he said it.

252
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,383
-He's terrible at it.
-Terrible.

253
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,885
He made it seem like
their relationship was so weak

254
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,180
that it would fall apart
if they left the house.

255
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,266
Like they're only going out
because they're in the same house.

256
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,146
He should've just said he wants to stay
since it's where he can see her the most.

257
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,523
So, he's just a bad communicator.

258
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,693
-He's not the smoothest guy.
-Not at all.

259
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,029
A man can't help it sometimes.

260
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,197
Old man.

261
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,284
Need a soda, old man?

262
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,704
I can't speak of other people.

263
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,789
That's so true.

264
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,791
You're like that, too.

265
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,128
Really? You seem so suave.

266
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,339
Not at all.

267
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,341
I don't talk at all.
Should I take this off?

268
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,469
He really doesn't.

269
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,974
I was yelled at for not talking at all
at a sushi restaurant on Christmas.

270
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,142
I heard about that incident.
It was something.

271
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,894
She said, "Poor me."

272
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,315
-I remember you mentioned this.
-That was my Christmas.

273
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,278
"Even the chef is trying
to liven up. Poor me."

274
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,198
What a line.

275
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,867
The "poor me" fiasco.

276
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,411
Makes my heart ache.

277
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,997
-I wonder how she's doing.
-I wonder.

278
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,666
I passed her on the street once.

279
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,751
Anyways...

280
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,293
let's watch!

281
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,007
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

282
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,347
{\an8}It's good to see you again.

283
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,392
{\an8}You haven't been here lately.

284
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,560
{\an8}-I heard you won.
-I did.

285
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,562
{\an8}Thank you, thank you.

286
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,772
{\an8}-Was he strong?
-He was.

287
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,440
{\an8}DAIKI MIYAGI, 25 YEARS OLD,
ACTOR, TARGET SHIBUYA OWNER

288
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,941
{\an8}IPPEI SHIMA, 31 YEARS OLD,
COMEDIAN, PART-TIMER

289
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,443
{\an8}Did everyone come watch
from <i>Terrace House?</i>

290
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,779
Uchi had work and couldn't make it.

291
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,448
I only met up with Arisa.
Everyone else came, though.

292
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,324
That's like you, Daiki.

293
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,993
-What?
-It's your pattern.

294
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,453
-What do you mean?
-You know, at the end--

295
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,871
-The ringside kiss?
-Yeah.

296
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,997
I'm not that cool.

297
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,749
-What happened?
-Something happened?

298
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,044
She asked me out on a date.

299
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,634
There's another match in February.

300
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,386
I'll think about it.

301
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,097
-He's good with the win for now.
-He got the date.

302
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,684
-You've got the date.
-Isn't that all you care about?

303
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,145
More importantly, I have to find a job.

304
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,523
Wanna work as a trainer?

305
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,649
That sounds fun.

306
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,275
I can introduce you, as well.

307
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,403
I can introduce you, too.

308
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,655
-Same place as usual?
-Yeah.

309
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,408
-The Loco Mart in Kamakura.
-The Loco Mart?

310
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,660
-You know it?
-Yes, I saw it.

311
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,871
Oh, yeah.
It's tradition from Tetsu's year.

312
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,164
It's been handed down.

313
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,875
-Gardening, right?
-Yeah, I think it's a good fit for you.

314
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,587
If you want, I'll talk to them.

315
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:25,633
-Why don't you give that a try first.
-Yeah, I'll give it some thought.

316
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,636
{\an8}KAMAKURA, KANAGAWA

317
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,723
{\an8}ONARI STREET

318
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,316
{\an8}-Hello.
-Hello.

319
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,653
{\an8}Ippei told me I should come in.

320
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,821
{\an8}HISATO KOJIMA
OWNER

321
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,573
{\an8}I heard you're looking for part-time work?

322
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,992
Yes, I'm looking for work.

323
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:56,330
Well, I told Ippei
I'm okay if he's vouching for you.

324
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,414
Thank you.

325
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,833
Location won't be an issue?

326
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,670
I can, but it does take me an hour
to get here.

327
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,757
What time would I start?

328
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,552
Well, we usually start at 8:00 a.m.

329
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,263
And if the location is Tokyo or Yokohama,

330
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:17,059
you can meet up with us.

331
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,145
I'm confident in my endurance.

332
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,271
You surf?

333
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,273
I did a little surfing in Hawaii.

334
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,400
-Not in Japan.
-No, not in Japan yet.

335
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,485
I would like to.

336
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,237
-It'd be close here in Kamakura.
-That's true.

337
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,323
And you can start any day?

338
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,950
Yes, I can.

339
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,203
The sooner the better, actually.

340
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,705
It's almost Christmas.

341
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,958
I wanted to make some money for a gift.

342
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,628
-There's a girl I like.
-Is there?

343
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,755
That's nice.

344
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,465
-It's inevitable.
-I suppose so.

345
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,179
At Target's Christmas party.
Will be home late. -Arman & Arisa

346
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,351
{\an8}Arman?

347
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,937
Arman?

348
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,318
Are you okay?

349
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,947
I'll leave some water.

350
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,453
He's dead.

351
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,798
{\an8}-Good morning, Arman.
-Good morning.

352
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,760
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

353
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,388
-What happened to your eye?
-I don't know. I don't remember.

354
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,975
-I don't think you got in a fight.
-I didn't, right?

355
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,769
Maybe I ran into a door.

356
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,980
I'm sorry if I did anything yesterday.

357
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,064
I don't remember.

358
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,525
Nothing happened.

359
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,612
But you fell asleep in the taxi.

360
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,988
I fell asleep?

361
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,743
-I totally don't remember towards the end.
-Really?

362
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,994
You drank a good amount, too.

363
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,747
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

364
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,207
Going somewhere?

365
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,420
-I thought we were going to the park.
-Oh, yeah.

366
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,673
What do you mean, "Where am I going?"

367
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,549
-You're early.
-What?

368
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,927
Didn't we say we'd go in the morning?

369
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,224
-Did we?
-We did!

370
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,644
Will we make it?

371
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,229
We will.

372
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,148
It doesn't have to be there.

373
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,025
I'm okay if we go some other day.

374
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,695
No, I'll be fine.

375
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,405
Will you be able to do the rides?

376
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,489
I don't know.

377
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:45,082
{\an8}YOMIURILAND
INAGI, TOKYO

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,502
{\an8}-What shall we ride?
-What should we?

379
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,881
{\an8}-The go-carts--
-I want some ice cream.

380
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,551
You said ice cream earlier, too.

381
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,095
I feel so sick.
I don't think I can ride on anything.

382
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,058
Want to go have ice cream then?

383
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,019
-You want to ride the go-carts?
-I want to.

384
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,362
This is fun! Stop!

385
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,114
-This feels good.
-It does.

386
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,372
Scary?

387
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,800
This is scary!

388
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,219
Wait!

389
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,096
I'm scared!

390
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,973
I'm scared!

391
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,061
I said stop!

392
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,105
SKY CYCLE

393
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,567
Is it good?

394
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,533
It's good.

395
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,619
WANDIT

396
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,711
Oh, no.

397
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,504
It's gonna fall.

398
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,181
I'm scared!

399
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,272
I feel nauseated.
I feel like vomiting.

400
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,356
-Really?
-Yeah.

401
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,858
Do you want to use the bathroom?

402
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,652
I think I do.

403
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,952
{\an8}Sorry about today.

404
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,203
{\an8}That's okay.

405
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,330
{\an8}I don't feel well.

406
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,208
I'll never drink again.

407
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,003
-Never? That's impossible.
-Never.

408
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,047
I feel sick.

409
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,050
Should we head back early today?

410
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,717
-Or...
-No.

411
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,846
Let's ride the Ferris wheel
before going home.

412
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,556
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

413
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,599
Let's ride it, then.

414
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,560
-Since we're here.
-Yeah.

415
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,854
Excuse me.

416
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,315
-Bathroom?
-Yeah, I'll be a sec.

417
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,962
Sorry for the wait.

418
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,840
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

419
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,424
Are you sure?

420
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,139
It's so pretty.

421
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,937
It's amazing toward the back.
The greens.

422
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,193
Arisa.

423
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,447
It might be a little crushed, but...

424
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,449
Merry Christmas.

425
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,871
-It's a little early.
-A present?

426
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,997
For me?

427
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,791
-I didn't get you anything.
-Don't worry about it.

428
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,335
Thank you.

429
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,255
-A scarf!
-Yeah. It'll get colder.

430
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,012
-It's warm.
-It looks good.

431
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,471
-Really?
-Yeah.

432
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,181
It's warm.
Thank you, Arman.

433
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,808
I'll use it.

434
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,685
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

435
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,150
-It looks warm.
-It's super warm.

436
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,154
I wasn't expecting a gift at all.

437
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,781
I'm so happy.
Thank you.

438
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,700
-It looks good on you.
-Does it?

439
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,256
Arman...

440
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,592
why are you up there?

441
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,181
Yesterday, I came home trashed.

442
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,516
-I threw up on my bed.
-Gross.

443
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,477
-Wasn't it a special day today?
-Yeah, it was.

444
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,896
-So, even though it was special...
-Before Christmas.

445
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,734
We got there,
and I threw up an hour later.

446
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,278
Disgusting.

447
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,322
I threw up a total of five times.

448
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,990
-That's horrible.
-It was.

449
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,325
That's the worst.

450
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,578
Normally, there's a popular image...

451
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,830
of the Ferris wheel kiss when you go,

452
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,124
but I didn't feel romantic at all.

453
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,542
I couldn't say anything romantic.

454
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,377
-The kiss?
-Of course not.

455
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,589
-The worst date ever.
-It really was.

456
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,716
The worst one in my life.

457
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,219
-What are you gonna do? Try again?
-Yeah.

458
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,805
I'm thinking dinner,
then maybe taking her to the Tokyo Tower.

459
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,268
Does that mean you're asking her
to be your girlfriend?

460
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,686
Since you're going for it?

461
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,106
I'll go for something, for sure.

462
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,398
Just the kiss.

463
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,775
What? You're gonna kiss her
before telling her how you feel?

464
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,111
Isn't that normal?

465
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,613
It's totally different from how I think.

466
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,865
Next time.
Today was a total fail.

467
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,950
Don't drink the night before.

468
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,204
-I won't drink anymore.
-Yeah, you shouldn't.

469
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,207
Is Arman okay?

470
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,791
Arman?

471
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,461
Arman looked totally sick.

472
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,340
Well, he was trying really hard.

473
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,549
The roller coaster?

474
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,219
He couldn't do the adult ride.

475
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,764
So, we went on the kid's ride,
but even that was a bad idea.

476
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,225
Arman felt that sick?
That's terrible.

477
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,353
He gave me a Christmas gift.

478
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,980
-What is it? Acne?
-This.

479
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,150
It's from my favorite brand.

480
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,401
-I don't know how he knew.
-Which brand?

481
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,694
-Acne.
-Really? From Acne?

482
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,572
-Wow.
-Right? I didn't have anything for him.

483
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,117
I wasn't thinking of a Christmas gift.

484
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,869
-I see.
-Should I get him something?

485
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,831
-You should.
-I should, right?

486
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,918
I'm glad I got to see him
not trying to impress me.

487
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,297
He was saying he wanted to do it over.

488
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,216
But maybe because I got to see
that side of him,

489
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,551
I feel closer to him.

490
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,677
Really?

491
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,389
I thought you'd be unhappy
since he was hungover...

492
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,391
and you couldn't have fun.

493
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,767
Not at all.

494
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,311
I didn't mind at all.

495
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,854
Because, you know...

496
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,399
If you go out, you'll see their faults.

497
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,235
So having seen it,
I feel like I know him better.

498
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,116
What the heck?

499
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,203
This is stupid.

500
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,996
What do you mean "stupid"?

501
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,832
She feels closer because he threw up?

502
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,959
That's just perverse!

503
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,920
Unexpected events can bring you closer.

504
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,380
She's excited by a guy who threw up!

505
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,798
That's totally perverse!

506
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,508
That's not it!

507
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,720
She's just a pervert from Kagoshima.

508
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,681
He totally changed after the crepe scene.

509
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,765
Oh, the crepe.

510
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:03,019
It was an indirect kiss.

511
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,688
It was a shock.

512
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,815
He said it was the end.

513
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,817
It never started.

514
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,779
Not every occurrence brings them closer.

515
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,866
-It could distance them.
-Yes.

516
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,452
He went to the park hungover.

517
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,954
Even though it was hard for him, he went.

518
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,874
His behavior was probably good.

519
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,459
Because he was trying hard?

520
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:30,506
She did feel as if he was usually trying
to act a little cool.

521
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,965
So, on the 24th?

522
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,717
That's right.
You said it'll happen.

523
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,969
Yeah, it'll happen.
It'll happen.

524
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,013
He was saying
he's going to kiss her first.

525
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,097
What a dog.

526
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,393
Too risqué.

527
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,604
He's going to be kissing her all the time
once they get together.

528
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,064
He's the kind of guy
who'd do it all the time.

529
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,066
Definitely.
I don't care anymore.

530
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,568
Don't care.

531
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,987
-Everyone.
-Yes?

532
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,781
I have some sad news.

533
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:01,370
This will be Ayumu's last appearance.

534
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,622
-He's leaving us?
-He's leaving.

535
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,999
-He's studying for exams.
-Oh, of course!

536
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,125
Oh, it's exam season.

537
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,044
-What grade are you in?
-Ninth grade.

538
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,088
Wow, so you are entering exam season?

539
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,800
It's no time to be watching
some strange foreigner throwing up.

540
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,886
That's so true.

541
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,596
You must learn about
more important historical events.

542
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,601
Were you able to learn
anything about relationships?

543
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,729
Well, what was it... Locomoco?

544
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,856
The name of the shopping mall?

545
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,024
-Oh, Costco?
-Yes!

546
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,485
It sounds like food.

547
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,861
That?

548
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,866
-Costco?
-That's so cute!

549
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,787
I was waiting for one of our great lines,
but Costco?

550
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,080
It left an impression.

551
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,040
You learned
there was a store called Costco.

552
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,125
-So cute!
-Cute!

553
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,795
Were our words so meaningless?

554
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:58,093
You'll focus on your studies for now,

555
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,639
but there may come a time
when you'll experience love.

556
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,434
When you need advice,

557
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,811
come to this guy.

558
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,398
Ayumu has the right to choose.

559
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,775
I'll be happy to give you advice.

560
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,694
You're the expert now?

561
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,029
So can I ask you for advice, too?

562
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,260
Tell me, why did you decide
to move in to <i>Terrace House?</i>

563
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,846
Mainly, because I thought it'd be fun.

564
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,055
Simple as that.

565
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,642
Would you be taking turns
with others to take a bath?

566
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,060
But if I am first,
since I am so filthy,

567
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,646
no one wants to after that.

568
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,105
You must use it in the end.

569
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,485
I will when I come home
from the construction site.

570
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,280
Let's all go visit him.

571
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,947
At <i>Terrace House?</i>

572
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,160
Hello?

573
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,203
{\an8}Can I talk to you right now?

574
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,456
{\an8}Is dad with you?

575
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,379
I see. Remember I went for an audition
for <i>Terrace House?</i>

576
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,381
I passed.

577
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:25,306
I have been without a boyfriend
for about a year.

578
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,390
So maybe...

579
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,476
Would that be too good to be true?

580
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,188
No guy left to be a good match for me?

581
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,026
I am not prepared for this yet...
