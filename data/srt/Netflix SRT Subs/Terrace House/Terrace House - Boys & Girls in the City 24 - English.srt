1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,435
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,188
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,610
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,906
So last week,
the meat incident continued.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,659
That's right.
Another crisis on top of everything.

9
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,495
Tatsuya's breakdown.

10
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:42,000
TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 24 YEARS OLD
MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

11
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,252
Why are you crying?

12
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,295
Everything I've held back until now
broke loose.

13
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,756
From this shared living situation.

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,593
A lot has happened
and all he's held back finally exploded.

15
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,887
-An accumulation.
-Yes, that's right.

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,722
Who knew the meat crime
would come this far.

17
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,057
-That's right.
-That's true.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>-But they seemed to have made up.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

19
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>Problem solved.</i>

20
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,104
<i>And Arman...</i>

21
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,064
Seems to have started working.

22
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:08,569
-And he went to Arisa...
-That's right.

23
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,697
But if you feel something for me at all,

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,451
you could spare even ten minutes a day
to talk to me.

25
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,703
That's what I think.

26
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,872
So I wanted to ask one last time
how you feel about me.

27
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,293
I don't have time to think about
anything else right now.

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,836
ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,087
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>Arisa, when she first rejected him,</i>

31
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,843
told him that she wasn't ready yet
but wanted to get to know him more.

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,346
She left him with false hope.

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,602
And Arman, holding on to that hope,
foolishly believed her.

34
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,896
Arisa made that happen.

35
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,440
She's at fault.

36
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,027
She tried to let him down nicely.

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,322
-The way she rejected him.
-Is that really niceness though?

38
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,867
-No, I don't think it's nice at all.
-Yes, that's exactly right!

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,702
In my opinion, anyway.

40
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,495
-She completely betrayed me.
-You?

41
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,124
Yes.
We were on the same wavelength.

42
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,044
You've never been on the same wavelength.

43
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,004
Will you stop saying "creepy"
under your breath?

44
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,966
You think you're better than me,
don't you?

45
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,971
Well... shall we continue?

46
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,432
-Can I just say one more thing?
-What?

47
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,808
Thanks to everyone,

48
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:27,731
I've been commissioned
to do a commercial for Netflix.

49
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,359
And there's even
a kissing scene with an actress.

50
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,861
-We just filmed it.
-What?

51
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,945
You kissed?

52
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,405
-We kissed.
-What?

53
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,784
I play the role of her boyfriend
and she's completely into me.

54
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,454
-Well, it's her job.
-You mean within her role.

55
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,914
I know it's terrible,

56
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,041
but because of some bad takes
of the kiss scene,

57
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,751
I delayed production by three hours.

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,045
What?
How many bad takes were there?

59
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,757
I'm supposed to lay there
and then react nonchalantly to the kiss.

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,759
But I'd get so nervous,
and I'd be like...

61
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,972
Do you think
the actress was upset with me?

62
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,475
Upset? No.
Maybe grossed out.

63
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,690
I understand being nervous about the job.

64
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,444
But you just do it.
You just do as you're told.

65
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,697
I can't emotionally detach myself
from a kiss yet.

66
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,492
I'm sure the actress would prefer it...

67
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,994
-if you could detach yourself.
-Otherwise, it's gross.

68
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,334
Your mom isn't here today.

69
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
PUKUICHI

70
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,222
PUKUICHI
TORITSU DAIGAKU, TOKYO

71
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,810
-Hi.
-Hi!

72
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,730
-Were you able to find it easily?
-Yeah. It was close to the station.

73
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,815
You've got full-on makeup today.

74
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,942
I had work today.

75
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,363
-Are you hungry?
-I am.

76
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,532
The food here is super delicious.

77
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,910
-This is your friend's place?
-Yeah, it's my friend's place.

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,541
When I told everyone
you invited me out to dinner,

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,503
Uchi was like, "Seriously?"

80
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,047
He said you hardly invited anyone.

81
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,799
Did it make you wonder why?

82
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,926
No, not really.

83
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,431
I was just thinking about
how I could get to know you.

84
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,728
And that's when you invited me.

85
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,147
So it honestly made me happy.

86
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,482
-Really?
-Yeah.

87
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,609
Honestly.

88
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:42,616
After the meat incident,
did anything change between you and Uchi?

89
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,868
I think that it did.

90
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,998
We both talk to each other more now.

91
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,044
-I think we changed in a good way.
-I see.

92
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,588
-I'm happy for you.
-Yeah. Me too.

93
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,258
-I'm glad we ate the meat.
-That's so true.

94
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,343
It ended well?

95
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,179
I don't know if Uchi feels the same,
but...

96
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,229
It's delicious.

97
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,772
Isn't it?
It's so good.

98
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,484
Totally off topic, but...

99
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,153
did you come to <i>Terrace House</i>
thinking you'd find love?

100
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,364
-Not at all.
-I see.

101
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,826
I totally didn't think
it was a possibility.

102
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:30,247
I want to find love,
but at <i>Terrace House...</i>

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,502
I don't know if I can.
I'm like you.

104
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,587
But you were saying yesterday...

105
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,384
about how Hikaru's great,
but his age...

106
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,470
-That, I don't get.
-Why?

107
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,140
I've never dated or fallen in love
with someone younger.

108
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,477
I want to be the pampered one.

109
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,773
And I feel like
I can't have that with someone younger.

110
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,067
But that just depends on the guy's...

111
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,945
ability.

112
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,410
I'm really glad that we went out today.

113
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,328
-Here.
-I'm glad.

114
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,421
It is really nice
you have someone you love to give it to.

115
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,008
I'm pretty envious.

116
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,386
-He said he wants one from the store.
-Seriously?

117
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,972
-He said he wants Godiva chocolates.
-That's terrible!

118
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,316
-Is it good? Hot?
-It's hot.

119
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,819
It's hot! Hot! Hot!

120
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
It's good, but it's hot.

121
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,539
Look at that!

122
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,499
-It's cute!
-It's super cute!

123
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,004
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-Happy Valentine's!

124
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,089
Wow, they're all wrapped.

125
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,425
-Ta-da!
-Did you buy them?

126
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,927
No! We made them together.

127
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,512
Woo!

128
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,599
-Yay!
-Wow.

129
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,268
-Yay, thanks!
-For Arman!

130
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,353
Wow! It's got my name on it.

131
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,730
-Are they all different?
-For Hikaru!

132
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,023
-Thanks.
-Happy Valentine's.

133
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,191
It says, "For you."

134
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,194
-This one's also for you.
-Yeah!

135
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,528
Take a look at this!

136
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,697
Don't you guys want to see?

137
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,742
-Hey, guys!
-You should see!

138
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,620
-Aren't you guys interested?
-It says "Hikaru" here.

139
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,121
They're ignoring us.

140
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,999
-Hey, mine's smaller.
-Hey, over here!

141
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,585
-I knew you'd notice.
-Look here.

142
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,128
Is this, like, the leftover?

143
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,631
It's good.

144
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,633
-Yeah, it's a cookie.
-Yay!

145
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,802
-It's good.
-Thanks.

146
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,179
I'm sure Arisa has stuff for you, too.

147
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,514
Oh, Arisa...

148
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,017
-Is she coming back?
-Yeah.

149
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,936
She said she would be home late.

150
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,813
I have an announcement.

151
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,108
What?

152
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,194
The morning of the 18th...

153
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,862
-we'll be leaving.
-What?

154
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,365
Why so sudden?

155
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,908
You have to tell us earlier.

156
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,744
-That's why we're telling you early.
-There's still four days.

157
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,789
We were gonna say it yesterday,
but decided to wait for Arisa.

158
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,836
-What? This is so sad.
-Hikaru's about to cry.

159
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,838
I'm not, but...

160
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,924
I'm not. I'm not crying.

161
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,969
So, the snowboarding trip
will be our goodbye trip.

162
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,095
I'm glad we're going snowboarding.

163
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,306
-Yeah, let's go have fun.
-You don't even know how to snowboard.

164
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,475
-I can't, but...
-Let's go have fun.

165
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,394
Everyone has scheduled to go snowboarding
except Natsumi.

166
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,316
KAWABA SKI RESORT
TONE COUNTY, GUNMA

167
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,861
-Arman, you're going to wear sunglasses?
-Shouldn't I?

168
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,323
-Wow.
-It feels great!

169
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,077
I hope I don't fall.

170
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,829
-Look out.
-Nice.

171
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,497
It's so beautiful.

172
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,125
-First snow of the season?
-First snow for the mountain.

173
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,263
How do I stop?

174
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,113
Then you lean forward, like this.

175
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,330
You're leaning too much, Arisa!

176
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,541
Little by little.

177
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,190
AZABU-JUBAN, TOKYO

178
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,822
-Welcome back, guys.
-Hey!

179
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,240
Looks amazing!

180
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,493
How was it? Fun?

181
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,080
-It was fun!
-We're all in pain.

182
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,791
-It was great weather today.
-It was.

183
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,126
It was warm.

184
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,921
All of us getting together...

185
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,091
Yeah, not since the incident.

186
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,135
-Incident? It was a house meeting.
-Oh, yeah.

187
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,513
What was the most memorable moment
for the two of you?

188
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,057
-Of course, the "coward" incident.
-"Coward!"

189
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,267
Oh, it's not the meat?

190
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,978
No.
Though that was memorable, too.

191
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,896
For me, it was the meat incident.

192
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,399
-Really?
-Maybe because it was recent.

193
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,985
I was more surprised by the meat incident.

194
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,736
Wish I'd seen it.

195
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,405
-It was your fault.
-Yeah!

196
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,656
Why is it my fault?

197
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,450
I wasn't too involved though.

198
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,119
-You did eat it.
-You did eat some.

199
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,913
That couldn't be helped
because I was hungry.

200
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,749
You owe me ramen, Hikaru.

201
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,005
-What's with your expression?
-I'm suddenly feeling sad.

202
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,925
It is sad, for real.

203
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,386
I mean, you guys met here.

204
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,054
-That's true.
-Right?

205
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,683
Yeah, we were strangers before this.

206
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,519
It's amazing.

214
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,030
-You haven't eaten?
-I have.

215
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,407
I had a cheese katsu bento.

216
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,743
Ramen! Ramen!

217
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,869
Let's really go.

218
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,914
Sure, I'll take you to a great place.

219
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,958
-Let's go.
-Take us.

220
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,585
My head's starting to spin.

221
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,421
Wow,
from just four percent alcohol content?

222
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,927
Ew, he's grossing me out.

223
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,971
You always say stuff like that.

224
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,305
It hurts, you know.

225
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,059
She does, right?
Like, "I don't like you!"

226
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,519
It always gets to me.

227
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,312
-But you really like her.
-Breaks your heart?

228
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,106
I like you very much.

229
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,150
-More, more.
-Look into her eyes.

230
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,944
I love you.

231
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,156
Man, that was bad.

232
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,326
-You've never said that to me.
-I've told you I love you.

233
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,330
Why are you making a face like a catfish?

234
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,207
A catfish?

235
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,918
He calls me <i>Ms. Catfish</i>.

236
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,004
-Like a catfish?
-Ms. Catfish!

237
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,714
He totally calls me Ms. Catfish.

238
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,632
But you do kinda look like a catfish.

239
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,676
Like a catfish...

240
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,594
You do have a catfish face.

241
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,014
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

242
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,974
Oh, Arisa.

243
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,352
Uchi's wasted.

244
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,687
His face is all red.

245
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,188
What about ramen?

246
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,691
-His face is hot.
-It's the last night.

247
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,901
-Let's get ramen, Uchi.
-Yeah.

248
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,571
-Let's go then.
-Yeah, let's go.

249
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,865
-We're off.
-Have fun.

250
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,158
-Bye.
-See ya.

251
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,785
I can't drive.

252
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,079
-Hikaru can.
-I'm not gonna drive.

253
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,459
That's the closest
I've ever seen you guys.

254
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,294
You and Uchi.

255
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,838
Very lovey-dovey.

256
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,757
We're not a weird couple?

257
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,468
You're not a weird couple.

258
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,971
-I was pretty hurt by that.
-No way.

259
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,347
Yeah, you were upset.

260
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,185
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,394
It's okay.

262
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,524
Since going out for okonomiyaki together,

263
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:24,572
since I invited you out,
things have changed between us.

264
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,827
I wish I had more time...

265
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,914
with you.

266
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,792
It's a little late now, but...

267
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,929
Why don't you stay another week?

268
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,890
Don't cry.

269
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,536
I guess this is goodbye.

270
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,582
Thank you for everything.

271
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,584
Thank you.

272
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,294
Thank you.

273
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,879
Thank you.

274
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,048
It was a fun six months.

275
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,508
Six months.

276
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,802
We had our arguments...

277
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,430
but it was fun.

278
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,850
Looking back, it was fun.

279
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,478
Shall we?

280
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,743
See you around, Hikaru.

281
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,957
Bye.

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,625
See you, Arman.

283
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,462
Good luck.

284
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,255
I'll see you.

285
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,009
Thank you, Minori.

286
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,261
Bye.

287
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,849
-See ya!
-See ya.

288
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,184
-Bye!
-Bye!

289
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,980
Thank you.

290
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,690
Thanks, Uchi and Minori.

291
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,774
-Good luck!
-Bye!

292
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,071
NISHI-AZABU, TOKYO

293
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,992
So...

294
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,287
I'm going to move into <i>Terrace House.</i>

295
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,080
What?

296
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,999
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

297
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,211
-Yeah.
-When?

298
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,713
-Tomorrow.
-What! Tomorrow?

299
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,881
Are you serious?

300
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,220
I want to experience co-op living.

301
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,554
Seriously?

302
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,517
And it'd be nice to meet someone.

303
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,898
-It's good, right?
-Yeah, I'm envious.

304
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,235
What about your part-time job?

305
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,820
I'll continue working.

306
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,614
-You will?
-Yeah.

307
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,452
I'll continue my other jobs, too.

308
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,081
Only my living situation will change.

309
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,042
So that's okay.

310
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,835
I'm so excited.

311
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,879
It's an unknown world.

312
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,593
The cafe in Asakusa you were working on...

313
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,137
-did you finish that?
-Yeah, I'm done with that.

314
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:40,434
So when you have to work,
you're gonna work here?

315
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,021
Yeah, I'll work from here.

316
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,358
-You're gonna use it as your studio?
-Yeah.

317
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:54,115
We've had drinks together often,
but that's it for now.

318
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,618
I'll be moving to <i>Terrace House.</i>

319
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,705
What made you decide?

320
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,999
I'm graduating...

321
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,792
I figured it'd be a good change of pace.

322
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,713
But the people who are looking for working
in the entertainment industry

323
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,964
and the people who aren't

324
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,217
have completely different reasons
for joining <i>Terrace House.</i>

325
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,554
What are you looking to gain specifically?

326
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,890
I don't know what I'll gain.
I don't know what life there will be like.

327
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,394
But there are more possibilities there
than if I stay here.

328
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,730
You're going to accept
both pros and cons?

329
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,318
Yeah, it wasn't a decision
based on logical reasoning.

330
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,194
It's more like an adventure.

331
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,993
It was nice at the end
for Minori and Natsumi...

332
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,370
They became close.

333
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,042
It's been a while since we got to see
a harmonious <i>Terrace House.</i>

334
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,672
Now that they've overcome this together,
they may be really close for life.

335
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,300
-Maybe.
-It's possible.

336
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,262
It reminds me of an old soap opera
with Akina Nakamori and Narumi Yasuda.

337
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,015
-I've seen that.
<i>-Just the Way We Are!</i>

338
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,225
Yeah, it's like the two of them.

339
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,686
Natsumi is Akina Nakamori.

340
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,730
That's right.

341
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,732
The song was, <i>Just by You Being Here.</i>

342
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,692
-By Kome Kome Club.
-Was it?

343
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,363
I bought the CD for my girlfriend then.

344
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,032
-Oh, I see.
-It brings back memories.

345
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,575
Saying, "It's just for you?"

346
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,829
I've become so tainted.

347
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,168
-They're coming.
-The new members.

348
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,213
-The girl seems pretty.
-Totally beautiful!

349
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,757
-This area of the pretty one...
-Yes, the face structure.

350
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,386
Is the guy in architecture school?

351
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,304
Seemed like a group of creative types.

352
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,640
-Maybe graphic--
-Didn't he mention graduating?

353
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,267
-He seems put together.
-Yeah.

354
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,519
I wonder.

355
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,355
It doesn't seem like he'd get along
with Arman and Hikaru.

356
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,315
I wonder.

357
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,150
-Really, now.
-That's true.

358
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,445
-Just curry is fine, right?
-Yeah.

359
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,740
-There's only four of us.
-That's true.

360
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,577
-Can I switch this?
-Yeah, thanks.

361
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,549
Thank you.

362
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,134
"If you use it,
you should wash it right away."

363
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,136
That's my motto.

364
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,138
I see.

365
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,639
I see.

366
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,475
-Is it ready?
-Doesn't chicken take a while to cook?

367
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,477
But we're gonna add water.

368
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,937
Oh, sorry.

369
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,272
I'm so hungry.

370
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,695
Could it be...

371
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,239
It's happening now?

372
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,036
Hello.

373
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,164
<i>Hi, I'm moving in today.</i>

374
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,333
Please come in.

375
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,469
-It is a girl.
-I guess a girl is coming first.

376
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,721
What?

377
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,892
Isn't it weird
that we're going to greet her here?

378
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,520
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

379
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,899
I'm Misaki Tamori.
It's nice to meet you.

380
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,150
Nice to meet you, too.

381
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,445
-I'm sorry to greet you here.
-It's okay.

382
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,906
-We were cooking...
-What were you making?

383
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,909
Curry.
Let's eat together.

384
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,994
Thank you very much.

385
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,996
Of course.

386
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,249
-Should I sit down?
-Please sit.

387
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,169
-I'm sorry. What is your name again?
-I'm Misaki Tamori.

388
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,629
-Misaki?
-Misaki.

389
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,131
My friends call me Tamochan or Tamosan.

390
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,257
Tamosan?

391
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,927
-How old are you?
-I'm 23.

392
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,888
What do you do?

393
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,266
I'm trying to break into the entertainment
industry, while working part-time jobs.

394
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,601
-A model?
-No.

395
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,603
-More like variety shows.
-Oh, talent shows.

396
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,522
MISAKI TAMORI, 23 YEARS OLD
ASPIRING ENTERTAINER, PART-TIMER

397
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,273
-Where are you from?
-From Hokkaido.

398
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,486
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-I don't.

399
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,072
-How long since your last one?
-About a year.

400
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,448
Oh, we're the same.

401
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,910
It's like a dream.

402
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,540
I've always watched the show,
so it's strange to actually be here.

403
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,002
How long have you lived here?

404
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,505
A little over a month.

405
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,217
-Did you have any trouble sleeping?
-Not at all.

406
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,553
-You too?
-Yeah.

407
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,430
Do you tend to worry about little things?

408
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,266
-Not at all.
-Then you won't have trouble sleeping.

409
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,767
Not at all, huh?

410
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
Not at all?
Do you like to clean?

411
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,147
-Oh, no!
-You like to keep clean?

412
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,316
Oh, no, something is bound to happen!

413
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,943
You don't keep tidy?

414
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,737
I'm not going to hold back. Is that okay?

415
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,323
But I might say something back.

416
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,492
-This is gonna be good.
-Yeah.

417
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,078
Like, "What's wrong with that?"

418
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,290
-Okay.
-Something that's the norm for me

419
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,292
might not be for someone who likes
to be clean.

420
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,877
For example, after you eat,
do you leave it behind?

421
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,130
-I do.
-That's the norm?

422
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,674
-It's not, but...
-You might eat it later.

423
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,925
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I get it.

424
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,969
-No, I meant trash.
-Yes, I leave it.

425
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,887
-Do you throw it out right away?
-No, later.

426
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,347
Let's do it right away.

427
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:16,145
Oh, no! But I thought
maybe being here will make me better.

428
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,272
Oh, then please do.

429
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,483
-But I still might say something.
-Okay.

430
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,445
So, have you asked?

431
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,489
-What's your type? What kind of guy?
-Oh, my type?

432
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,159
Someone who's considerate
of those around them.

433
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,578
And looks?

434
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,331
For looks, I'm not consistent.

435
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,751
I've dated guys
with both soft and welldefined features.

436
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,586
I don't have a specific type.

437
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,464
I think it's ready.

438
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,801
I wonder if we have enough roux?

439
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,095
Oh, we haven't added it yet.

440
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,222
Will you drink today?

441
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,390
I will.

442
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,642
Should we buy some?

443
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,977
-I can go.
-The convenience store?

444
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,272
-Do they sell curry there?
-Roux? They do.

445
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,400
-They do?
-I need to go anyway, so I'll go too.

446
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,694
-Would you mind?
-We'll buy some.

447
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,779
Please.

448
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,572
Thank you.

449
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,657
Thank you.

450
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,244
Everyone seems nice.

451
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,246
-I'm glad.
-They are.

452
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,498
-Probably.
-Probably?

453
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,916
I shouldn't talk about other people.

454
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,045
I wasn't sure if I could be friends.

455
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,883
-Why?
-I thought we might clash.

456
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,051
I wonder.

457
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,804
-You never know.
-I guess we'll have to see.

458
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,263
That's scary.

459
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,186
What do you think of her?

460
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,729
Might not be my type.

461
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,147
-For real?
-Yeah.

462
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,899
But I'm sure it'll be fun.

463
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,734
I seriously think...

464
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,237
she's super cute.

465
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,321
-Super cute?
-Yeah?

466
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,406
Your type?

467
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,825
-She's pretty high energy.
-Yeah.

468
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,410
I love that.

469
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,037
Nice.

470
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,666
But at least, in the worst case scenario,
I want someone with a nice rack.

471
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,169
Of which, there isn't, but...

472
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,296
-I like her.
-Her personality?

473
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,299
Her personality and face, too.

474
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,470
It's nice that everyone eats together.

475
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,514
Cheers!

476
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,267
-Glad to have you here.
-Thanks for having me.

477
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,229
-I'm home.
-You surprised me.

478
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,273
-Welcome back.
-Nice to meet you.

479
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,441
It's nice to meet you.

480
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,651
I moved in today.
I'm Misaki Tamori.

481
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,861
I'm Arisa.

482
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,779
Welcome back.

483
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,823
-Did you cut your hair?
-I did.

484
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,909
How does she know?

485
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,328
-Do you want some curry?
-I will.

486
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,040
She's apparently the type
who speaks her mind.

487
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,125
You are?

488
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,043
Yeah, it was a surprise.

489
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,713
Minori would get quiet
when Nacchan was around.

490
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:52,217
But you just laugh and give it right back.
I'm impressed.

491
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,552
It's good.

492
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,721
So this must be better for you, Nacchan.

493
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,848
-From your point of view.
-Really?

494
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,601
-Arisa, you've really brightened up.
-Really?

495
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,187
-Work is going well?
-Yeah.

496
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,522
-Same old?
-Yeah.

497
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,775
-Is there anything we can do to help?
-Did you tan?

498
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,443
I didn't.

499
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,904
-It's hard to tan now.
-Um...

500
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,531
-Paint?
-It'd be nice if you could paint.

501
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,242
At the place?
Paint what? Boxes?

502
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,620
-Bricks and stuff.
-Bricks?

503
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,413
Are you doing something?

504
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,207
I'm putting on an exhibit in March.

505
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,417
-For hats?
-Yes.

506
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,127
That's nice.

507
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,712
Next week?

508
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,006
Yes, we're starting next week.

509
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,092
-Let's go to help with the painting.
-Of course.

510
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,137
-Can I use the <i>Terrace House</i> car?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

511
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,014
I can drive.

512
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,433
-You can drive?
-Yeah.

513
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,560
-Hikaru's driven us before.
-Yeah.

514
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,312
A speed demon.

515
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,815
-I don't drive like that. Cut it out.
-That'd be scary.

516
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,442
-I drive safely.
-You seem like you're a bad driver.

517
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,820
-What?
-Bad?

518
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,238
You're 18, right?

519
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,907
I'm probably the best driver in the group.

520
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,991
Well...

521
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,536
-Have you been in the car with Arman?
-I have.

522
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,787
-I'm good.
-He is good at it.

523
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,539
I don't know
what your definition of "good" is.

524
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,623
It's normal.

525
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,167
Whatever.
I'm never driving you.

526
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,086
Don't pout.

527
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,468
When it piles up...

528
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,721
just drain it.

529
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,808
Wasn't Hikaru totally pissed?

530
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,601
What? About the driving?

531
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,104
-I think he was mad.
-He was.

532
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,523
-Was it scary?
-Yeah.

533
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,819
-I can't tell if he's serious or not.
-Yeah, it's hard to tell.

534
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,696
It always seems like he's joking.

535
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,615
-I did get a little scared.
-Yeah.

536
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,118
Yeah, he was mad.

537
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,744
I wonder.

538
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,456
-Tamosan...
-Tamosan.

539
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,458
She reminds me of Asami Mizukawa.

540
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,669
She is very frank
like an actress, Asami.

541
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,296
ASAMI MIZUKAWA

542
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,757
It's good.
You like her right, Kentaro?

543
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,925
Yes.

544
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,261
-What?
-Yes, she's interesting.

545
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,804
Go Kentaro, go!

546
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,433
That lady there is dangerous.

547
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,186
Don't listen to her.

548
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:12,274
She really didn't need to say
that he seemed like a bad driver.

549
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,569
-Yeah, that wasn't good.
-Oh, it's bad.

550
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,281
-I thought maybe Hikaru would like that.
-Yeah.

551
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,449
Like it would fire him up.

552
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,533
Yes, yes...

553
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,037
Listen, listen...

554
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,248
Not just you, Triendl,
but to all the female viewers.

555
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,416
Yes.

556
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,294
Men, of course, enjoy being teased...

557
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,715
but not about their driving!

558
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,799
You get it, right, Kentaro?

559
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,343
-You're 18.
-I totally understand.

560
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,136
I see.

561
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,057
Driving is an essential part
of being a man.

562
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,975
It's special.

563
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:52,356
So, if you're told you're bad at it,
it's very demeaning.

564
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,650
He was pretty pissed.

565
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,026
He was like, "What?"

566
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,278
And to be told that
in front of everyone...

567
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,781
They just met.

568
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,950
-Yeah, so driving...
-So, it's bad.

569
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,409
Better to leave it alone.

570
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,454
Especially coming from a girl
he's interested in.

571
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,332
-It's shocking.
-Yeah, there's definitely that.

572
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,668
Yeah, it was bad timing.

573
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,169
That expression...

574
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:20,259
From a female point of view,
does that turn you off?

575
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,137
-Is this worth apologizing about?
-No.

576
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,555
That might hurt his pride more.

577
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,641
To say, "I'm sorry I said
you looked like you'd be a bad driver."

578
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,103
"It's fine."

579
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,438
-Crying?
-Yes, crying.

580
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,691
"No one's ever said that
about my driving."

581
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,862
-We've got the new guy coming.
-Yes, we do.

582
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,866
Dreams for the future?
We haven't asked that yet.

583
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,535
-An amusement park.
-She said that earlier.

584
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,287
-Arisa didn't hear.
-An amusement park?

585
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,414
-To build one?
-Yes.

586
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,960
-Wow, like a Disneyland?
-Yes.

587
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,879
Then, I'll build you a hat store, too.

588
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,090
What? For me?

589
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,508
Inside the park?

590
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,180
-An amusement park of everyone's dreams.
-That's right!

591
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,183
-I see.
-I'll build one for you.

592
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,144
For her?

593
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,654
Plans for tomorrow?

594
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,657
-Off?
-Off.

595
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,409
Off tomorrow?

596
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,493
What about you, Arisa?

597
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,121
I have work,
but I'll be home early Sunday.

598
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,205
What about you, Nacchan?

599
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,957
-I'm off tomorrow.
-No way!

600
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,125
Really.

601
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,586
-Did you show her room?
-Not yet.

602
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,920
Why don't you show her?

603
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,091
No way!

604
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,176
Seriously?

605
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,596
-At this time?
-Arman, let's go see the guy.

606
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,223
Really?

607
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,352
Yes?

608
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,270
<i>I'm moving in today.</i>

609
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,522
-Come in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

610
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,491
I'm really nervous for some reason.

611
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,785
Maybe because it's so sudden.

612
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,413
-Wow.
-What do you mean, "wow"?

613
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,791
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
