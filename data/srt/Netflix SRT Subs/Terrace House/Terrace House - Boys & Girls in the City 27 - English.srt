1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,306
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,017
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,644
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,396
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,899
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,777
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,529
Last week...

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,905
Hansan...

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,992
Of course it's Hansan.

10
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,202
Hansan...

11
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,331
There was a big event.
The birth of a new couple.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:43,043
Hikaru and Misaki were so cute.

13
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,921
It started a little awkwardly
with the ex-boyfriend talk.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,131
But he apologized.

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,467
{\an8}I'm attracted to you.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,178
{\an8}HIKARU OTA, 18 YEARS OLD
MISAKI TAMORI, 23 YEARS OLD

17
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,764
{\an8}-That caught me off-guard!
-Yeah, and...

18
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,226
{\an8}Hearing you say
you want to get back with your ex...

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,603
{\an8}I didn't like it.

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,107
{\an8}I didn't want to hear it.
I realize that was immature of me.

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,192
{\an8}I tried to end the conversation.

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,402
{\an8}I'm sorry. I apologize.

23
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,779
{\an8}I understand.

24
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,405
{\an8}I'm glad to hear it.

25
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,908
{\an8}You could tell
that made Misaki like him more.

26
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,452
Like he knows how to apologize.

27
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,580
The gift was so cute.

28
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,291
-While she was drinking tea.
-Yeah, while drinking tea.

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,168
-It was so cute!
-So cute, she was embarrassed.

30
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,380
Was it like that?

31
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,673
The tea's spilling.

32
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,717
The tea's spilling!

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,385
Excuse me, the tea's spilling.

34
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,137
It's this angle...

35
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,598
The sushi cake was a nice idea.

36
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,018
Thank you.

37
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,981
-I went shopping with her.
-So it helps you relax, right?

38
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,942
"I'm sorry for saying you're immature.

39
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,488
I'm really happy to have met you
and everyone at <i>Terrace House.</i>

40
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,199
I'm looking forward to my time here.
Happy birthday!

41
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,660
From Misaki."

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,744
Thank you.

43
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,499
And at the end,
we got to see Hansan's personality.

44
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,834
That was too amazing.

45
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,045
That was a perfect scene.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,755
That scene was perfect.

47
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,216
{\an8}If you decide on the placement,
I can make it.

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,343
{\an8}-This is exciting.
-No way.

49
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,096
{\an8}I'm so stressed about time.

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,309
{\an8}The most interesting results
come from challenges.

51
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,894
{\an8}-Do they?
-Definitely.

52
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,229
{\an8}Don't worry.
It'll definitely succeed.

53
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,314
{\an8}<i>I wonder what she's gonna do?</i>

54
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,650
Natsumi said she doesn't care
whether or not he has a girlfriend.

55
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,736
Hansan, who has a girlfriend...

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,780
It'll be interesting to see
how he turns down Nacchan.

57
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,406
-I want to know!
-That's what I mean.

58
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,533
-Maybe he's up to something.
-That's it.

59
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,410
He is a guy, after all.

60
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,370
There's a way of doing it.

61
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,580
There's a way?

62
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,624
-There's a way of doing it.
-There's a way of doing it.

63
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,044
You two and your experiences...

64
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,088
You immediately refer
to your own experiences.

65
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,423
Like right now.

66
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,133
Don't talk so happily

67
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,552
about how you've cheated
on your partners in the past!

68
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,806
There's a backdoor.

69
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,851
Of course there isn't!

70
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,728
Don't talk nonsense.

71
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:10,398
But if there were to be such a scene,
depending on how Hansan deals with it,

72
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,526
it could either lower his stock
or make it go higher.

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,946
It could go up
even if he does something bad.

74
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,365
Can that even happen?

75
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,075
-It's possible.
-It's possible.

76
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,498
{\an8}Pull this string.
Pull it here.

77
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,250
{\an8}Pop it on.

78
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,002
Too big?

79
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,756
Your head is so small.
Here.

80
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,049
-Hold on when we're riding.
-Got it.

81
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,605
Okay?

82
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,024
Okay. Ready.

83
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,445
You can get off.

84
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,867
{\an8}KAMAKURA, KANAGAWA

85
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,002
-I'm tired.
-You're tired?

86
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,754
-It was fun.
-Was it?

87
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,216
-It wasn't scary at all.
-Right?

88
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,052
-Your hands were pretty low.
-No way!

89
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,428
-Really?
-Yeah.

90
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,931
-The whole time?
-You were leaned over like this, right?

91
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,308
The tip of your glove was...

92
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm sorry, I'll be careful.
I'll be careful on the way home.

93
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,814
I didn't mind at all.

94
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,442
Will you take me on a ride again?

95
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,069
Sure.

96
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,653
I might get addicted.

97
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,197
The hot springs...

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,907
Do you want to take a trip
to the hot springs?

99
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,204
-Bon appétit!
-Please.

100
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,501
It's like what I made.

101
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,336
You can make something like this?

102
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,590
No, I can't.

103
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,926
-Why don't you have someone teach you?
-If I put my mind to it...

104
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,677
You mean Nacchan?

105
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,764
Do you have any requests?

106
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,683
-A hamburger.
-A hamburger?

107
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,022
I think I can make that.

108
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,191
Are you enjoying <i>Terrace House?</i>

109
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,737
Yeah, it's fun.
It's becoming more fun.

110
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,283
I was pretty quick.
Shortly after you came...

111
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,118
I confessed a lot.

112
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,121
-Like how I'm attracted to you.
-I didn't think... Yeah.

113
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,497
What did you think?

114
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,128
I was surprised.
I had no idea you felt that way about me.

115
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,212
Really?

116
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,174
But it made me happy.

117
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,731
{\an8}ENOSHIMA SHRINE

118
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,275

TWO TRUNKS CONNECTED BY ONE ROOT

{\an8}TIE TWO PLAQUES TOGETHER
TO BRING TWO SOULS TOGETHER

120
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,280
{\an8}Throw it in.

121
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,620
Give me some.

122
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,747
Give me some.

123
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,000
I want some.

124
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,710
Please let me have some.

125
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,801
-I want to climb that tower.
-The tower?

126
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:11,139
{\an8}ENOSHIMA SEA CANDLE

127
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,474
{\an8}It's the ocean!

128
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,725
Yes, it is.

129
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,020
-It's beautiful.
-It's the ocean! The ocean!

130
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,315
Amazing.

131
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,651
<i>-The ocean is...</i>
<i>-Is wide</i>

132
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,031
-Did you have fun?
-I did.

133
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,117
-Are you into motorcycles now?
-I'm into them.

134
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,619
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

135
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,537
For real.

136
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,374
-I laugh more when I'm with you.
-Really?

137
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,167
-Yeah.
-No way.

138
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,835
Did I do anything funny?

139
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,379
Let's go out again.

140
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,631
Yeah, let's go out again soon.

141
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,549
Soon.

{\an8}MISAKI TAMORI, 23 YEARS OLD,
ASPIRING ENTERTAINER, PART-TIMER

148
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,265
She said the bike was fun.

149
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,684
{\an8}That it was more fun than she expected.

150
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,228
{\an8}And that she wants to ride again.

151
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,774
-She wants me to take her somewhere else.
-Nice.

152
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,027
I want to hear more about the touching.

153
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,406
She's like this while we're riding, right?

154
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,537
This isn't a big deal or anything, but...
But she's like this, right?

155
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,332
I'm sure she didn't realize it,

156
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,460
but whenever her hands would relax...

157
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,838
Her hands would be here the whole time!

158
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,841
So that kinda felt good.

159
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,301
It felt good?

160
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,388
She's going to make me a burger.

161
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,184
-We kind of talked about that.
-Her?

162
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,771
Yeah, since she can't cook,
she said she'd ask Nacchan teach her.

163
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,398
Nice.

164
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:30,112
I like how she's putting in the effort
even if it's not something she's good at.

165
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,822
It was all kind of easy.
Well, not easy, but...

166
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,741
It went so smoothly.

167
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,909
You never know.
It was like that for me, too.

168
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,703
That's true.

169
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,747
I feel bad.
Sorry, man.

170
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,416
Why? Don't apologize.

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,211
She seems like a nice girl.
Not the brightest, but...

172
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,880
Any progress?

173
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,257
Nothing happened.

174
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,384
We said we'd go out again.

175
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,012
-You like him more now?
-I do.

176
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,306
I knew it.

177
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,600
I knew it.

178
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,644
-Was the bike cool?
-It was so cool!

179
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,938
I wanted to stay in that position forever.

180
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,064
No!

181
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,529
Seriously, it was so fun.
The bike is dangerous.

182
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,864
-Did it make you fall for him?
-It did.

183
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,159
Because it was so cool?

184
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,827
It convinced me that I really liked him.

185
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,956
I felt it.

186
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,751
I told him I'd make him a hamburger.

187
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,588
But I can't make it on my own, so...

188
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,299
-will you help me?
-I don't want to.

189
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,508
Please?

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,720
Won't he be happier
if you made it by yourself?

191
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,888
You think so?

192
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,974
It's like what happened with Arman.

193
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,436
That's true.

194
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,978
I'll get in trouble again.

195
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,314
Like, "Hey, you..."

196
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,983
You love him?

197
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,780
I didn't think
I'd fall for someone so quickly.

198
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,368
Misaki's having so much fun!

199
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,789
-What a wonderful date.
-So nice.

200
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,918
At the exact spot Tokui took his picture.

201
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,672
-That café?
-I did go to that café, yes.

202
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,133
I believe it may have been that very seat.

203
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,303
-The seat even?
-Yes.

204
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,597
-You sat there?
-Yes, I went and sat there.

205
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:26,394
And apparently, the waitress there
was interviewed by the media.

206
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:30,357
She told them I had the cheeseburger
and the lady had a plain burger.

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,899
Apparently that's what she said.

208
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,610
But actually, it was the opposite.

209
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,447
I had the plain burger
and she had the cheeseburger.

210
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,491
She had it all wrong.

211
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,327
These things are important.

212
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,789
It was typical girl talk about her crush,
complete with screaming.

213
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,207
Like, "Do you like him more now?"

214
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,335
"I do."

215
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,213
-So fun. Must be fun.
-Must be fun.

216
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:58,301
This is the best.
It's so fun watching this happen.

217
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,095
"I laugh more when I'm with you."

218
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,473
She did say that.

219
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,557
With the bike...

220
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,603
Triendl, do you ever fantasize about
riding a bike with a guy like that?

221
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,648
I want to do it!

222
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,610
Who did you just imagine in front of you?

223
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,028
I'm not going to tell you.

224
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,405
Really?

225
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,325
It's not Hansan.
I know who it is, though.

226
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,411
I won't ever tell.

227
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,082
{\an8}-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

228
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,126
-Welcome back.
-What're you doing?

229
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,672
-Girl talk.
-Random chatting.

230
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,964
Girl talk?

231
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,925
-I'll leave then.
-Did you cut your hair?

232
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,511
-I did.
-Yeah, he cut it yesterday.

233
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,595
I didn't know.

234
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,432
-It's girl talk, but...
-You should join us.

235
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,809
Did you eat already, Hansan?

236
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,352
I have some inari sushi.

237
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,437
-How fitting.
-Yeah.

238
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,147
-It was discounted 30 yen.
-Inari fits your image.

239
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,443
It's a little sad.

240
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,945
How did your entrance exams go?

241
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,614
My exams are done.

242
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,115
The problems...

243
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,702
My predictions for what would be on it
were right.

244
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,162
So it went well, then?

245
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,457
Yeah, I just have to wait for the results.

246
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,917
-I see. When are the results posted?
-Sunday.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,545
-That's soon.
-Yeah, it's soon.

248
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,255
So you won't be able to relax
for the next five days.

249
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,174
I'm off that week though.

250
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,801
-Really?
-For five days.

251
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,971
-How unusual.
-Yeah, the prep school at least.

252
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,726
So I wanted to finish other projects
in the meantime.

253
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,894
Hansan, can you cook?

254
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,688
-No, I can't.
-Can you prep and clean fish?

255
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,190
-I can.
-Really?

256
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,275
Yeah. I'm confident in my skills.
For that at least.

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,319
So you can clean fish
the moment you catch it?

258
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,906
-Yes. Well, I grew up near the ocean.
-Oh, really?

259
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,869
I don't know if you remember,
but the first day, I said I liked fishing.

260
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,747
-Right, you like fishing?
-Yeah, I like ocean fishing.

261
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,998
-In a boat?
-Yeah, a boat.

262
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,958
-But from the shore is okay, too.
-Nice.

263
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,668
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

264
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,753
You guys should go.

265
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,172
-It's super fun. It's--
-Sounds fun. You two should go.

266
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,675
-I have to free up a day.
-That's true.

267
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,176
Is there a day you can free up?

268
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,803
-Let me see.
-Okay.

269
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,723
With the exams,
you're probably not in the mindset.

270
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,600
Yeah, there's a lot going on.

271
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,727
It'll be a reward for all your hard work.

272
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,562
Yeah, let's do that.

273
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,147
Send me pictures.

274
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,440
-Okay.
-Sure.

275
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,155
{\an8}ICHINOE, TOKYO

276
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,917
-You can put that there.
-Okay.

277
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,548
CAFÉ KIMGURE HIKOSEN

278
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,008
This is a café run by handicapped people.

279
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,386
-This.
-Okay.

280
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,262
They asked me to add another one.

281
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,639
Here are the materials.

282
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,059
So I thought I'd have you paint them.

283
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,689
As you finish, I'll put it together.

284
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,291
Why did you come to Japan?

285
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:22,589
Well, I really just wanted
to try living in Japan.

286
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,842
I feel like...

287
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,555
I don't have enough time
to do everything I want to do.

288
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,224
There's a part of me that feels impatient.

289
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,604
So your Hawaiian way of thinking
is very appealing, but...

290
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,732
maybe I'm just jealous.

291
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,945
Are you thinking about
when you're going to leave?

292
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,364
No, I haven't thought about it yet.

293
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,660
I do want to stay until the summer,
just because I want to be here then.

294
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,995
That's so Hawaiian.

295
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:59,125
Do you already know
when you're going to leave?

296
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm planning on submitting something
in a competition this summer.

297
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,216
So for that,
after this living experience,

298
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,096
I'm hoping for a change in what I do.

299
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,431
-That was my thought.
-That's so cool.

300
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,227
I think it's great
to try different things,

301
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:24,817
as long as you keep moving toward
your goal of becoming a firefighter.

302
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,944
You're right.
I'm 25 already.

303
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,197
That's right.
You're 25. You're an adult.

304
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,617
-It's time to do it.
-Yeah.

305
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,877
Come here.

306
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,929
He's sleeping now, so...

307
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,432
You can wake him
and take the car somewhere.

308
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,850
Okay.

309
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,103
I'll say I need to shop
for some heavy things.

310
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,816
Yeah, something like that.
Wake him up.

311
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,901
-Thanks.
-No mistakes.

312
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,529
-You're not allowed to make anymore.
-I'll do my best.

313
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,448
-Your limit is an hour and a half.
-An hour and a half? Okay.

314
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,742
-That's the max.
-Okay.

315
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,118
Wake him up.

316
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,084
Morning.

317
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,754
Hikaru, will you drive me?

318
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,548
What?

319
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,341
Will you drive me somewhere?

320
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,425
What?

321
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,847
I need to buy some stuff.

322
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,850
-Is that okay?
-Okay.

323
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,728
Okay.

324
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,814
Yay. Let's go then.

325
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,568
Let's go.

326
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,152
I'm coming.

327
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,946
Please hurry.

328
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,285
You're not going?

329
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,787
I need to step out.

330
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:00,872
I see.

331
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,627
Have fun. Drive careful.
Nacchan's waiting for you.

332
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,003
Bye!

00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,652
I did.

346
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,570
By yourself?

347
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,407
-Yeah, I made it myself.
-Oh, while we were gone?

348
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,160
Wow, thanks.

349
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:26,123
-Does it look edible?
-The way it looks? It looks delicious.

350
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,960
You were going to say something else.

351
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,461
Where's Nacchan?

352
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,547
Nacchan's over there.
I don't know.

353
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,134
She's not going to have some?

354
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,011
I'm sure she will.

355
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,681
-Nacchan?
-Yes?

356
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,141
You should come.
I made some for you too.

357
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,310
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

358
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,814
-She made hamburgers.
-I want to try some.

359
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,734
Have some.

360
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,360
Please enjoy.

361
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,155
Go ahead. Try it.

362
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,083
It's a hamburger. It's good.

363
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,167
-Really?
-Yeah.

364
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,005
It's good!

365
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,214
-Really?
-Yeah.

366
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,549
It seems like you guys are lying to me.

367
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,554
It's really good. I'm surprised.

368
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,557
-It's good.
-It's not too hard?

369
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,683
It's not hard?

370
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,145
-It's hard.
-Yeah, it's hard.

371
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,980
Sorry.

372
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,775
-I have to be honest.
-But it still tastes good?

373
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,901
It tastes good. It's good.

374
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,737
-It's not bad?
-It's really delicious, but...

375
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,280
-Hard?
-Hard.

376
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
Just a little.

377
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,618
It's really delicious.

378
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,870
-Really?
-Yeah.

379
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,331
The fact that you made it for me...

380
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,625
-This is making me want to cry.
-I'm seriously moved.

381
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,085
-Why?
-I don't know.

382
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,711
Why?

383
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:55,922
What's wrong?

384
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,757
What? Why?

385
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,091
I'm sorry, it's not hard.

386
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,802
-No, it's not that.
-It's not hard at all.

387
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,304
You were worried, right?

388
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,269
-I'm sorry. What?
-No, no...

389
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,021
It's seriously good. Really good.

390
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,023
That's not what I meant.

391
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,691
-You're just relieved.
-Yeah.

392
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,485
Thank you.

393
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,739
I was really nervous about it.

394
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,033
About making it?

395
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,619
Yeah, I felt so rushed.

396
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,704
What?

397
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,624
I had Nacchan help me
so that I could make this.

398
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,293
But she didn't help you.

399
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,378
She wanted me to take you out.

400
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,590
Thank you.

401
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,509
I couldn't have done it without Nacchan.

402
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,846
Thank you.

403
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,140
Delicious.

404
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,225
I'm glad.

405
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,564
I'm so full.
It was delicious.

406
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,066
-Really?
-Yeah.

407
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,986
Thanks, Nacchan.

408
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,406
I think I'll go take a bath.

409
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,621
I'll see you later.

410
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,793
Are you sure it's not too bad?

411
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,462
How many times are you going to ask?

412
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,258
You don't have to finish it.

413
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,137
Just shut up.

414
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,848
-It's good.
-Thank you.

415
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,436
That was so good.

416
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,438
-So cute!
-Makes you want to be in love.

417
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,650
I want to be in love!

418
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,779
It's amazing, though,
that she cried at the sight of him eating.

419
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,199
She was really nervous about making it.

420
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,867
She was so happy.

421
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,579
-Those were really good tears!
-Really cute.

422
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,792
You don't get those kinds of tears
too many times in a lifetime.

423
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,171
It's different
once you get to know each other.

424
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,464
The very first time...

425
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:07,219
you made a hamburger for the guy you like
with the help of your friend.

426
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,182
You were able to make something
you thought came out pretty well.

427
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,517
He said he liked it.

428
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,146
Not like it was amazing,
but he told you it was delicious.

429
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,690
So many good moments.

430
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,192
So many good...

431
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,360
-Hey!
-Tokui!

432
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,445
Hey!

433
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,822
What's going on with you today, Tokui?

434
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,075
Feeling a little vulnerable?

435
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,078
-He's been through a lot lately.
-What happened?

436
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,955
My ex married her ex-boyfriend!

437
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,625
He just heard today.

438
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,090
-I'm happy for her.
-It's such happy news.

439
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,345
You said you want to be in love,
but this is what it leads to?

440
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,679
I'm happy for them.

441
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,015
-It's good.
-They're happy.

442
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,933
I'm happy for them.

443
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,104
-Hansan's words of advice.
-Yes, Hansan.

444
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,939
Wasn't Hansan's advice great?

445
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,692
-It was, wasn't it?
-It was great.

446
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,777
-The way he brought it up.
-Perfect.

447
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,988
-Right?
-Yes.

448
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:11,783
First, he says he admires him.
Brings up Arman's good points.

449
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,078
-"Maybe I'm just jealous."
-"Makes me jealous."

450
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,205
-Even though that's impossible.
-Right?

451
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,457
What do you mean, "Right"?

452
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,419
I don't think
it got through to Arman at all.

453
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,838
-I think it did.
-Really? He was blasé.

454
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,174
"I be here until August."

455
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,344
He didn't say it like that.

456
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,428
He did say that though.

457
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,139
"Aspiring firefighters
who come to <i>Terrace House</i>

458
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,598
{\an8}don't really end up as firefighters."

459
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,642
{\an8}TETSUYA SUGAYA, ASPIRING ACTOR
OCT '12-DEC '14

460
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,021
{\an8}-That's true.
-There's a bit of stigma to firemen here.

461
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,024
{\an8}When that really thin envelope arrived...

462
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,235
{\an8}You knew he didn't make it
just by the envelope.

463
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,362
{\an8}Like, he definitely didn't make it.

464
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,614
{\an8}-That's happened in the past.
-That did happen.

465
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,909
He's so cool.

466
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,496
His stock was already high,

467
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,082
but after the scene with Arman,
it'll rise even more.

468
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,335
-How high can it go?
-There's no sign of it dropping.

469
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,172
He does have plans to go fishing
with Nacchan later.

470
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,507
-Even there...
-It's going to go up.

471
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,467
-He'll definitely go up.
-Definitely.

472
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,553
He's probably really good
at putting on bait.

473
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,391
-And he'd smoothly help Nacchan with hers.
-He can do anything.

474
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,518
Nacchan seems pretty confident.

475
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,813
She considers it a reward for him
to hang out with her.

476
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,732
Pretty ballsy of her to say.

477
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,195
-Like, "It's a reward for your hard work."
-She just meant to do something fun.

478
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,613
Yeah, going out to do an activity for fun
is a reward.

479
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,824
-Seriously?
-That's right.

480
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,327
Isn't she saying she's the reward?

481
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,789
-Isn't that amazing?
-Will you stop looking at it like that?

482
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,486
We're just trying to make a hole,
so like this.

483
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,784
There's the hole.

484
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,245
-That's it?
-Yeah.

485
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,412
Ready?

486
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,999
It'll probably break somewhere.
Okay, that's it.

487
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,709
-That's it.
-Okay.

488
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,586
Do you enjoy stuff like this?

489
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,880
I haven't done it too often before,
but it's fun.

490
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,261
My dad is a carpenter,
so I used to do this when I was younger.

491
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,428
-Really?
-Yeah.

492
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,397
You know...

493
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,067
I know we're working,

494
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,986
but there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

495
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:54,655
To everyone.

496
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,657
Um...

497
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,995
When the exhibit is over...

498
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,751
I'm thinking of leaving <i>Terrace House.</i>

499
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,172
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

500
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:15,301
I've been working
with the exhibit as my goal,

501
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,469
but it's not the finish line.

502
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,139
From then on,
I have to run the business side.

503
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,976
You've worked really hard,
even staying here until the exhibit.

504
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,228
Really.

505
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,896
-Good work.
-Not at all.

506
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,980
Really.

507
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,277
It'll be an amazing beginning.

508
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,530
When I first came here,

509
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,366
I came wanting to meet people
from different fields,

510
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,328
hoping to be inspired.

511
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,871
And I was really inspired.

512
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:49,210
I was planning on working hard,
and this made me want to work harder.

513
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,462
-Thanks to you all.
-Good luck in the future.

514
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,135
-For now, I want the exhibit to succeed.
-Yeah.

515
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,805
With everyone's help.

516
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,439
I have the most memories with you, Arman.

517
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,777
It was really fun
going on those dates with you.

518
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:21,533
And even though things didn't work out,
it was fun being friends.

519
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:25,036
I know you work really hard.

520
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,624
It's the first time
I really admired a woman.

521
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,586
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

522
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,175
Whenever I talked to you,
you never treated me differently.

523
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,971
I can only say thank you for everything.

524
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,973
It was fun.

525
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,392
-All of it.
-It was fun.

526
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,811
I went to so many places with you.

527
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,313
Like the gym.

528
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,023
Yeah, the gym.

529
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,568
And Mt. Takao.

530
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,529
And the amusement park.

531
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,660
-Let's still meet up when we can.
-Yeah.

532
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,496
I'll work hard too.

533
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,748
With everything.

534
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,544
I'll work hard too.
