1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,056
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,684
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,268
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,979
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,607
{\an8}<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,568
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:31,949
Last week, Minori and Tatsuya
became a couple.

8
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,702
Congratulations.

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:38,496
-There was also a goodbye kiss.
-The kiss was nice.

10
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,123
{\an8}You're not gonna kiss me goodbye?

11
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,750
{\an8}-You want me to?
-I do.

12
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,087
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD
TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,546
{\an8}<i>I want to see them fight.</i>

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,131
{\an8}<i>-Me too.</i>
<i>-A lovey-dovey fight.</i>

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,300
And "I'm sorry" written on omu-rice after.

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,844
Cute!

17
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,887
That's so cute!

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,431
Why are they communicating by omu-rice?

19
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,308
It's like a bulletin board.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,897
There were happy moments,
but not all of them were.

21
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,650
The development
of Arman and Arisa's relationship.

22
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,860
{\an8}Maybe everyone's ditching.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,904
{\an8}-No, they're not!
-They must be ditching.

24
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,906
{\an8}ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD
ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,366
{\an8}Okay.

26
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,659
{\an8}-We made it?
-We made it.

27
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,704
{\an8}<i>Holding hands, feeding him bento...</i>

28
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,957
It's as if Arisa likes Arman.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,084
-What? She does.
-She does.

30
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,378
That hasn't been decided yet.

31
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,048
Wait, did you not see them holding hands?

32
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,800
-Didn't you see it last week?
-I did.

33
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:35,345
Arisa seemed really surprised.
"Oh, he's holding my hand."

34
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,140
What? No, they were swinging their arms.

35
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,352
Arman started that.
If she resisted, she'd hurt her arm.

36
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,481
-I don't think that would happen.
-That's not quite...

37
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,942
So I don't think it's decided yet.

38
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,944
You're not the only one who thinks that.

39
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,614
-Mizuki is probably thinking that, too.
-That's right.

40
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,617
{\an8}-Arman, let's go out to eat sometime.
-Sure.

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,535
{\an8}ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD
MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,828
{\an8}It's set then.

43
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,497
{\an8}"I'm always supporting
other people's relationships,"

44
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,167
is probably what she's thinking.

45
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,502
Inside.

46
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,797
"Are you okay with that?"
She asks herself in the mirror.

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,761
"Are you okay with that Mizuki?"

48
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,929
That's how it is.

49
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,766
So, thankfully, the time at <i>Terrace House,</i>

50
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,686
-has been extended, right?
-Yes, it's been extended.

51
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,190
But I'm sure
they're feeling the pressure of time.

52
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,525
So I'm sure
the attacks will be more aggressive.

53
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,027
-That's true.
-It'll be aggressive.

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,988
A complete love triangle.

55
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,365
The ring of love is a triangle.

56
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,286
Read all of Mr. Tokui's works
published for <i>Margaret.</i>

57
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,833
{\an8}-So, abstinence...
-Abstinence.

58
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,376
{\an8}-I can't drink for the next three weeks.
-No way!

59
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,003
-Until the match?
-Yeah.

60
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,088
I'm so sad.

61
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,884
Well, good luck preparing for the match.

62
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:56,969
Last day!

63
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,432
Here she is. We're drinking.

64
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,517
-Drinking?
-We are.

65
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,105
Cheers. Is this your last day
for drinks, Arman?

66
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
Yeah, last day.

67
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,984
Did you go hiking?

68
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,112
Oh, yeah, how was it?
And the bento?

69
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,696
-Yeah, thanks.
-Oh, you made an bento?

70
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,825
Arisa made it the night before.
It was super cute.

71
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,994
You did that?

72
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,789
It's the first time
someone made me an bento.

73
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,791
Really?

74
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,211
-Was it good?
-It was. It had spam musubi.

75
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,670
Lucky.

76
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,549
What are you doing Tuesday or Wednesday
next week?

77
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,135
-Arisa?
-Me?

78
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,594
I'm working Tuesday and Wednesday.

79
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,472
But I finish early I think.
Around 7:00 p.m.

80
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,143
If the timing works out,
let's go grab a bite or something.

81
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,853
A bite?

82
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,274
You should ask more clearly.

83
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,193
-It was a little vague.
-I see.

84
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,112
Let's drink. Should I bring more?

85
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,572
-There's no ice.
-I'll go buy some.

86
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,951
I can't believe we're out of ice.

87
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,787
I'll be right back.

88
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,579
-You okay by yourself?
-Yeah.

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,750
-I'll go with you, Arman.
-Thanks.

90
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,626
How was it yesterday?

91
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,421
It was fun.

92
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,423
And then?

93
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,717
And then?

94
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,470
Same as usual?

95
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,097
We held hands.

96
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,473
What?

97
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,063
We said, "Let's hold hands
until the summit."

98
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,148
What? From the start?

99
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:37,194
No, just before the summit,
and then we said, "We made it!"

100
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,239
To celebrate reaching the summit, I guess.

101
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,742
-And after?
-After?

102
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,287
He apologized for his sweaty hands.

103
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,919
So I said I'm sorry for my dry hands.

104
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,675
You're laughing.

105
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,928
What about Yuki?

106
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,888
-Yuki?
-Yuki.

107
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,224
You're having dinner with him, right?

108
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,350
Dinner?

109
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,519
Just the two of us?

110
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,938
I think he wants to.

111
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,733
-The two of us...
-I think so.

-This is embarrassing.
-I know.

123
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,257
Why are you watching that specific part?

124
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,759
It just happened by accident.

125
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,053
Is it work?

126
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,471
-I'm going to an exhibition.
-I see.

-You can make it with whatever we have.
-Okay.

You totally think it's a hassle.

133
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,615
Not at all.

134
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,000
It's ready!

135
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,751
Is it any good?

136
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,088
-Let me try a bite.
-Okay.

137
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,137
It's okay?

138
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,555
It's a mish-mash.

139
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,977
A complete mish-mash.

140
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,444
It's delicious.

{\an8}GAIENMAE, TOKYO

142
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,491
{\an8}Crepes. Maybe it's not that popular now.

143
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,451
{\an8}But there's a really good crepe shop.

144
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,788
They have sweet crepes
and more savory ones.

145
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,208
-Like, for a meal?
-Like ones for breakfast.

146
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,918
It's really good when you wrap
your breakfast in a crepe.

147
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,004
Like sausages?

148
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,131
It's located in Kailua.

149
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,929
We said we were going shopping today,

150
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,931
-but it turned into a walk.
-Yeah.

151
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,725
-Let's go again sometime.
-Yeah.

152
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,063
Bon appétit!

153
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,109
-Let's go eat crepes next time.
-Yeah, let's.

154
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,986
You're going to eat two, right?

155
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,365
-If we share, we can have two.
-Good idea.

156
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:15,328
But before that, I have to find a job.
It's already been a month.

157
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,372
Teaching English?

158
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,501
-Have other places...
-No, I haven't heard yet.

159
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,796
When are you going to dinner with Yuki?

160
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,714
-Tuesday.
-Tuesday?

161
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,965
Where are you going?

162
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:33,471
He messaged me earlier
saying he'll pick a place.

163
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,103
Are you going on a date with Mizuki?

164
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,690
We're going to dinner.
I don't know when.

165
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,902
-It hasn't been decided?
-No.

166
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,907
-Have you been here for a week now?
-Yeah, just over a week.

167
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,827
Is there anyone you're interested in?

168
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,333
Yeah.

169
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,131
I do, I think.

170
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,635
And you?

171
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,680
I do, too, I think.

172
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,224
There's someone.

173
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,144
Isn't that too much?

174
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,397
-Yeah, too much.
-It's green curry. That's spicy, right?

175
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,943
I was just curious.

176
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,822
What is this?

177
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,329
That was a conversation
between two people who like each other.

178
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,664
"Do you?" "Yes, I do."

179
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,001
"And you, Arman?" "Well, yeah."

180
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,628
"It's you."

181
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,256
Definitely an, "It's you."

182
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,009
It was like they were apologizing
for their other dates.

183
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,428
-Like they're obligated.
-Both of them.

184
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,515
Like, "You too? Me too."

185
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,477
It's terrible!

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,688
It's like,
"Then let's meet up afterwards."

187
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,024
That's right.

188
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,068
I'd hate it
if someone talked that way about me.

189
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,697
-Yeah, if you're on that end.
-Yeah, that's true.

190
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,367
I'm like Adachi, so I understand.

191
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,496
I invite people knowing
they might be thinking that way about me.

192
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,001
But what's important
is if you like them or not,

193
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,336
not what they think of you.

194
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,297
Exactly!

195
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,049
-A sound argument.
-A sound argument.

196
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,636
Arman... should find work.

197
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,055
-That's right.
-So true.

198
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,808
-It's about time.
-He hasn't passed any interviews yet.

199
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,270
He's an active bum.

200
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,354
That's true.

201
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,691
He's a very active bum from Hawaii.

202
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,734
Not anti-social, but anti-solitary.

203
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,658
-Like introducing a new style.
-Yes, like that.

204
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,909
Like an outgoing anti-social.

205
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,994
Isn't that just a normal person then?

206
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,247
We're all that.

207
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,666
We're all outgoing anti-socials.

208
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,253
{\an8}SUGAMO, TOKYO

209
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,679
{\an8}ITO TAKASHI
CEO OF TARGET

210
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,182
{\an8}RAOUMARU
4TH PLACE ON RISE HEAVYWEIGHT RANKING

211
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,353
Hello.

212
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,397
I'm Arman.
It's nice to meet you.

213
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,566
Come in and change.

214
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,276
Thank you for seeing me.

215
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,530
Now jab.

216
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,826
Nice.

217
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,910
Do it hard.

218
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,372
Don't hold back.

219
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:46,998
Now knees.

220
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,626
Hit hard.

221
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,794
If you do it hard,
it'll show in the match.

222
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,506
Hard knee! Hard!

223
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,090
Hard!

224
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,926
Give it your all. Keep your guard up.
Give it everything.

225
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,887
More!

226
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,013
Three hooks.

227
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,267
Hard!

228
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,394
-Ten hard ones.
-Make it 15!

229
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:12,565
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

230
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,317
Now a hard one!

231
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,402
Harder!

232
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,404
Again!

233
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,072
-Okay, good.
-Thank you.

234
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,157
Okay.

235
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,576
Not bad.

236
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,622
-He's got stamina for an amateur.
-He does.

237
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,956
Thank you.

238
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,542
Thank you.

239
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,461
-Thank you for today.
-How was it?

240
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,838
-It was tough, but fun.
-Was it fun?

241
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,634
But watching you practice,
I think you'll be okay for the match.

242
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,345
-Really?
-If you continue this way.

243
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,806
In the match,
attack before you're attacked.

244
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,599
-If you're hit, hit back harder.
-Hit back harder.

245
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,519
You get hit once,
hit them back two or three times.

246
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,604
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

247
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,773
-Come again.
-Thank you.

248
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,733
Thanks again.

249
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,072
{\an8}EBISU, TOKYO

250
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,203
{\an8}Bon appétit.

251
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,880
-It's good.
-Delicious.

252
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,675
-Have you been in the car yet?
-Hmm? Yeah.

253
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,844
At the house?
The yellow one?

254
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,638
No, I can't drive that one.
The big one, right?

255
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,391
I haven't been in it either.

256
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,267
-You can drive?
-I can.

257
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,063
I've been wanting to take it out.
I haven't driven in it yet.

258
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,690
-Let's use it sometime.
-The car?

259
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,318
Everyone said they wanted to go to Costco.

260
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,863
-Costco?
-Yeah.

261
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,990
-Costco?
-Not Costco?

262
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,450
That wasn't a moment for Costco.

263
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,284
I was asking you out on a date.

264
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,370
A date?

265
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,915
-You brought in Costco.
-I see. I thought it was a Costco moment.

266
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,379
Well, that and I want to drive the car.

267
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,297
A day trip in the car, maybe.

268
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,594
Yeah.

269
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,763
Let's go somewhere.

270
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,057
Shall we go somewhere?

271
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,561
We do have a car after all.

272
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah. Exactly.

273
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,075
I'll think of where we can go
for a day trip.

274
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,286
-A day trip?
-Yeah, with the car.

275
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,330
-Let's drive somewhere.
-Not Costco?

276
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,999
Anywhere.

277
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,877
I want to go to Costco.

278
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,462
-You want to go to Costco?
-Yeah.

279
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,297
Errands?

280
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,300
-Minori said she wanted to go, too.
-Okay.

281
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,640
The popcorn's good there.
Is there any popcorn left?

282
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,017
There were about two left.

283
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,644
I haven't eaten any recently.

284
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,323
{\an8}Where are you inviting her to?

285
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,868
{\an8}Well, I haven't driven the car yet.

286
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,329
{\an8}So I wanted to go somewhere with the car.

287
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,122
-On a date?
-Yeah.

288
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,083
-A day trip?
-Yeah, a day trip.

289
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,876
I've been looking up places.

290
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,505
And, well, this time of year
it'd be nice to see Christmas lights.

291
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,049
-When are you going?
-We haven't decided.

292
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:29,471
But we were talking,
and she didn't seem that excited.

293
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,806
She wasn't into it?

294
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,933
She was like,
"Let's go to Costco with everyone."

295
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,101
Oh, she changed topics?

296
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,144
Yeah, she threw in "everyone."

297
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,773
If she's not into it, then I'm...

298
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,316
Well, I don't know,

299
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,861
but if she's not interested,
she would say so.

300
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,738
-She would? That's true.
-She would.

301
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,156
You should just go for it.

302
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,160
Ask her out. Maybe just ask her now.

303
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,873
-Better not to have regrets.
-Yeah, I agree.

304
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,208
Do it! Go!

305
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,543
I'll go now.

306
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,463
Thanks.

307
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,964
I'm gonna do it.

308
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,048
Go do it.

309
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,217
That's set.

310
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,386
-Sequences.
-You love that.

311
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,013
I pass.

312
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,598
Pass.

313
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,642
Here.

314
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,101
I win.

315
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,978
-Really?
-I won.

316
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,859
-That's the card, right?
-Yeah, the card.

317
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,360
Let's use the full deck.

318
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,738
That's set.

319
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,660
Everyone wants to play.

320
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,495
Hey.

321
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,996
Can I talk to Arisa for a bit?

322
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,791
-Of course.
-Okay.

323
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm stepping out, then.

324
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,798
-Wanna sit there?
-I'll sit there.

325
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,258
Sorry to interrupt the card game.

326
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,928
That's okay. I was losing.

327
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,513
I wanted to talk to you

328
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,140
because I didn't get to properly
ask you out earlier.

329
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,352
I wanted to go somewhere with you.

330
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,230
So I wanted to invite you.

331
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,193
-Not to Costco with everyone?
-No.

332
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,071
I said I wanted to take the car somewhere.

333
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,907
With just the two of us.

334
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,035
-The two of us?
-Yeah.

335
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,665
I see.

336
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,921
I don't mind if it's with everyone...

337
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,635
instead of going with just the two of us,

338
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,762
like a day trip.

339
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,306
I'd rather go somewhere with everyone.

340
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,235
-Right.
-Yeah.

341
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,196
Well, I'm sure it'll be fun with everyone.

342
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,712
What's wrong? You look down.

343
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,047
Of course.

344
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,717
-What happened?
-It was not good.

345
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,388
She said, "With everyone."

346
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,558
So that means no?
I guess she has feelings for Arman.

347
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,728
Either that or...

348
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,022
I wonder what it is.

349
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,691
Maybe she's not in relationship mode.

350
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,654
-But she did go with Arman.
-That's true.

351
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,656
-That's true.
-Right?

352
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,365
-She did go with Arman.
-That's right.

353
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,825
It just didn't work out.

354
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,250
Why did you decline before you went out?

355
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,462
Even if the two of us went out,

356
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,801
I just can't see Yuki

357
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:59,221
as someone I'd be attracted to.

358
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,811
And right now,
I have someone else I'm interested in.

359
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,771
So to go out with someone else...

360
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,819
-Feels like you're two-timing?
-I guess so.

361
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,826
{\an8}OMOTESANDO, TOKYO

362
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,829
{\an8}HAKATA
TREE OF NAGI

363
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,831
{\an8}Sorry to keep you waiting.

364
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,833
{\an8}-Did you wait long?
-Not at all.

365
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,001
{\an8}-Cheers!
-Cheers!

366
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,465
Short hair looks good on you, Mizuki.

367
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,508
I cut it!

368
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,344
I said before I didn't like short hair.

369
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,137
That's right! You did say that.

370
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,890
-But it looks good on you. I like it.
-Yay!

371
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,433
Uchi?

372
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,310
-Yeah, Uchi.
-He's good.

373
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,896
-I was pretty worried though.
-It looks really good.

374
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,983
How are things going?

375
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,275
Not bad.

376
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,153
-Do you know who you're going to fight?
-I don't know.

377
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,238
You won't know until the day of?

378
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:03,410
Yeah. They weigh us the day before.
I'll know then.

379
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,748
Yesterday?
Did Arisa go with you yesterday, too?

380
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,958
Yeah, she did.

381
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,209
That's nice.

382
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,254
-Since she's a member now.
-Oh, a member.

383
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,506
-So Arisa kickboxes too?
-Yeah.

384
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,842
Wow, sounds fun. I see.

385
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,763
How was it?
You went to Mt. Takao for hiking, right?

386
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,223
Yeah, it was good.

387
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,893
That's good. Did you hear?

388
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,311
-What?
-About Yuki?

389
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,230
-I haven't heard.
-You haven't?

390
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,315
-Then maybe I shouldn't say.
-Why not?

391
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,110
Tell me.

392
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,905
It's probably good news for you.

393
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,406
-For me?
-Yeah.

394
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,534
To be honest, since Arisa came...

395
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:50,082
I've been attracted to her,

396
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,752
and we've gone out a few times.

397
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,089
You like her?

398
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,217
I think I'm starting to.

399
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,886
-Right now.
-That's great.

400
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,557
I'll be rooting for you.

401
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,644
Did she say she was coming on the 13th?

402
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,814
I asked her about it once.

403
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,441
-She seemed okay with it?
-She seemed okay.

404
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,234
You have to show her how cool you are.

405
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,279
-Yeah, I can't lose.
-No, you can't lose.

406
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,908
That's painful!

407
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,703
-She's going to root for them.
-She's going to support them.

408
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,081
She realizes he doesn't have feelings
for her anymore.

409
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:35,711
Arman said what he did because
he knew he had to convey that to her.

410
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:41,175
And Mizuki cut her hair
as if she already knew.

411
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
Oh, that's right.

412
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,806
"I already knew.
I'm rooting for you."

413
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,184
"Since I'll have to cut it sometime
in the near future."

414
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,730
-It's so deep!
-It's so sad!

415
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,817
I guess people still cut their hair
when love doesn't work out.

416
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,319
The feelings linger
in the ends of your hair.

417
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,448
-That's beautiful!
-That was beautiful.

418
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,327
-That's why women cut their hair.
-That's so cool.

419
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,414
What about Tap?

420
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,208
I feel so bad for him!

421
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,294
"Costco? With everyone?"
She said it three times.

422
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,380
He should get it.

423
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,175
Tap probably thought
Arisa was a Costco fanatic.

424
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,263
So he should've realized at that point?

425
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,891
I guess it was obvious
she didn't want to go.

426
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:30,975
At that point, yeah.

427
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,520
She repeated Costco
because he kept asking.

428
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,647
With everyone.

429
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,152
The spell to end things,
"Costco! Costco! Costco!

430
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,819
It's not working! Costco!"

431
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,781
That's what was happening.

432
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,075
Like the spell of destruction from <i>Laputa.</i>

433
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,743
Is that being nice though?

434
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,787
I found it really painful.

435
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,747
When he said,
"Let's go, just the two of us,"

436
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,417
she says,
"Um, Minori said she wanted to go, too."

437
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,627
Isn't that embarrassing?

438
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,798
That's probably the result
of trying not to hurt him.

439
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,301
Is that what it is?

440
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,635
When he suggested the day trip,

441
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,306
she said, "Day trip?"
Like it was the most horrible thing.

442
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,600
"Day trip" isn't usually repeated
so many times.

443
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:17,688
It's like she's solving a crime,
"Day trip?"

444
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,109
He's asking lightly,
but the question was heavy.

445
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,413
-Hey.
-Hello.

446
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,914
-Hello?
-Hello.

447
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,042
You're like an old man.

448
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,252
Nothing wrong with "hello."

449
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,254
-Welcome home.
-I'm back.

450
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,132
What are you going to do?

451
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,926
-The program is extended.
-Right.

452
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,386
Well, yeah...

453
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,848
-It doesn't end the 18th week.
-No.

454
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,643
We're in the losing group.

455
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,812
Losing group? Yeah.

456
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,357
We lost two battles in a row.

457
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,484
Two battles, two losses? Was it?

458
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,777
Maybe the last one wasn't really a battle.

459
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,946
Two tries, two losses... I guess.

460
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,241
We have one more month.

461
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,952
-And I wanted to stay until the end.
-Yeah.

462
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:20,459
But if it extends another three
or six months, then what'll you do?

463
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,960
Eighteen weeks for you?

464
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,714
You're going to leave after 18 weeks?

465
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,591
I might leave now.

466
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,218
Really?

467
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,804
The next step after Arisa, I guess.
Maybe it's time for me to move on.

468
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,476
-I've wanted to go overseas.
-You did say that.

469
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,811
And then after that,

470
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,733
I'll think about my future.

471
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,279
For me...

472
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:54,410
I didn't gain any insight
on what I want to work towards.

473
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,580
And it's not like I've reached that goal.

474
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,583
And I haven't found a boyfriend.

475
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,045
You know...

476
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,212
Yeah.

477
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,966
I am considering leaving.

478
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,970
I don't need to be cool...

479
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,559
and have some big reason to leave.

480
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,018
That's true.

481
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,564
I'm thinking that it's okay

482
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,733
to just say, "I had fun. I'm satisfied."
