1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,972
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,684
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,768
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,187
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,523
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,859
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,197
{\an8}Last week,
there was a discussion about Makoto...

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,032
{\an8}He said he's gonna be serious
about baseball...

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,367
{\an8}-He came to tell us that.
-Yeah, he came to tell us.

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,452
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,955
{\an8}After that, for about three days,
he went to sleep early.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,957
{\an8}So I thought
he was being good about it, but...

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,418
{\an8}When I get up to go to school,
I've seen Makocchan sleeping...

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,587
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,214
{\an8}...more often than not.

16
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,424
{\an8}Actually, the league games
have already started.

17
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,384
{\an8}I'm trying...

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,510
{\an8}But I get elbow pain.

19
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:53,596
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,722
{\an8}So with that...

21
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,389
{\an8}It's okay if you don't make it.

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,474
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,434
{\an8}If there was evidence of your effort,

24
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,019
{\an8}I'd think that's great.

25
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,270
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD

26
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>He clearly displays his annoyance</i>
<i>with his expression.</i>

27
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,110
I love that!

28
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,779
Your favorite?

29
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:15,659
Both Minori and Yuriko's feelings
for Makoto are fading.

30
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:16,994
That's right.

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,747
-Yeah, and there's the new turn of events.
-That's right.

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,749
Uchi, the hair stylist...

33
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,627
{\an8}I was thinking...

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,253
{\an8}that I want to ask you out.

35
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,337
{\an8}Part two?

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,006
{\an8}<i>They're going to go to Chichibu.</i>

37
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,134
I hope it pours that day in Chichibu.

38
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,844
Leave them alone!

39
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:39,057
So in the house, Tatsuya and Minori
seem the most likeable...

40
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,478
They're the oasis of <i>Terrace House.</i>
Everything else is rocky.

41
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,272
And Mr. Tap...

42
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,942
social media broke his heart.

43
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,030
But Yuki and Yuriko have
their Blue Note date...

44
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,281
What?

45
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,033
That Blue Note thing...

46
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,663
She doesn't want to go with Yuki.
She just wants to go to Blue Note.

47
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,374
But I guess anything can happen,
depending--

48
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,458
That's right.

49
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,545
We do want someone to save Yuki.

50
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,130
That's true.

51
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,765
{\an8}SHIBUYA, TOKYO

52
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,685
{\an8}Hey.

53
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,436
{\an8}What're you reading?
<i>Slam Dunk?</i>

54
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,521
{\an8}Yeah, the last one.

55
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,605
{\an8}The last volume?

56
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,942
{\an8}I have to finish!

57
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,234
{\an8}KURUMI NAKADA, MODEL
MINORI'S OLDER SISTER

58
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,237
What are you going to do?
With <i>Terrace House?</i>

59
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,114
Close your knees.

60
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,742
You sit like that all the time.

61
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,869
Your posture must be bad.

62
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,830
I do this with my legs, too.

63
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,290
Yeah, bad posture.
You do that thing with your arm, too.

64
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,668
I keep thinking you need to straighten up.
You're being filmed.

65
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,337
Yeah.

66
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,505
Mom was saying,

67
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,925
"How can Minori live with her sloppiness?"

68
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,635
Am I sloppy?

69
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,473
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

70
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,516
How is it at the house?

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,352
What do you want to do there?

72
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,312
What do I want to do?

73
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:12,275
You know how Mizuki was chastised
because she was unclear about her future?

74
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,236
How come no one said anything about you?

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,405
-You're not sure either, right?
-Yeah, I like modeling now, but...

76
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,742
But you don't know if it's for you.

77
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,577
What about what you studied at school?

78
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,997
Oh, I want to work at a ranch.

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,749
I want work...

80
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,834
to be satisfying.

81
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,960
Oh, I see.

82
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,589
So while you're young,
while you're still pretty, you'll model?

83
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,592
-And when you're old and wrinkly--
-That's not it, but...

84
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,804
Since I'm in Tokyo,
and there's something I can do here...

85
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,348
You're not listening.

86
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,433
If there's something you can do?

87
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,646
If I can make money while I'm in Tokyo,
then I'll model.

88
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,025
-Are you getting work consistently?
-Not at all.

89
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,736
-You earn more at your part-time job?
-Totally.

90
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,280
-Why don't you let that go?
-My part-time job?

91
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,492
Well, that's fine, but...

92
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,078
It might force you
to take modeling more seriously--

93
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,832
I did that before, and it did help.

94
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,250
That's good.
Why can't you do that?

95
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,212
But then I started getting
less work again.

96
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:18,216
But if you keep turning to other jobs,
you're gonna be stuck in that cycle.

97
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,553
Right?

98
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,182
-I'll quit. I'm going to quit.
-You should.

99
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,228
Oh, yeah.
I'm going on a date with the hair stylist.

100
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,231
So you like Uchi?

101
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,193
I don't know.
That's what I'll find out.

102
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,736
So you think you could like him.

103
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,991
-So, the first date was fun?
-Yeah it was.

104
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,368
Well, I didn't see him that way then.

105
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,040
Well, good.
You need a boyfriend.

{\an8}-I seriously can't take it.
-What, touching?

115
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,478
No, stop rubbing your hands
on my arm to wipe stuff off.

116
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,897
You're a towel.

117
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,982
Seriously.

118
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,693
Soba eatery.

119
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,070
I think it's here.

120
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,740
It's getting smooth.

121
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,412
Switch!

122
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,170
Good work.

123
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,218
And separate?

124
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,054
You can put it there.

125
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,638
-Wow, it's soba.
-It's thick!

126
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,432
Looks like soba. Good job.

127
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,188
You're doing well.
You've got rhythm.

128
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,232
Oh, you have rhythm.

129
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,318
I think it's getting thinner and thinner.

130
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,738
Looks like soba,
and maybe half udon.

131
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,953
This section is a little thick,
so let's move it here.

132
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,663
The udon's been separated.

133
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,049
Bon appétit.

134
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,643
Tastes like soba.

135
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,521
-Tasty.
-Delicious.

136
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,814
It's soba.

137
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,774
{\an8}That was fun.

138
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,739
{\an8}I'm scared!

139
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,824
-Oh, wow.
-Seriously?

140
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,201
This is crazy!

141
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,954
Here I go!

142
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,499
Wow!

143
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,238
What's this?

144
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,866
-Oh, this view is totally <i>Terrace House.</i>
-Oh, yeah, we see it all the time.

145
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,078
{\an8}We always go far away from the house.
Is that okay?

146
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,163
{\an8}You like that, right?

147
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,748
I like to, but wasn't sure if you did.

148
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,376
I do! I had fun.

149
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,794
-You had fun?
-Yeah.

150
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,462
I'm glad.

151
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,799
Minori...

152
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,761
is there someone in <i>Terrace House</i>
you're attracted to?

153
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,640
That's right, I'm asking straight out.

154
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,019
No?

155
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,064
I'm not sure.

156
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,775
Well, I asked you out because I like you.

157
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,904
What do you mean, you like...

158
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,034
Oh, I'm so bad with this stuff!

159
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,994
I'm not looking for a yes or no.

160
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,496
I understand.

161
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,207
You get it?

162
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,002
But I wanted you to know how I feel.

163
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,969
He's starting to look cute,
even with his high voice.

164
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,431
It's such a refreshing date,

165
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,600
kind of an ideal date.

166
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,355
Her reaction to his confession,
that means she's happy, right?

167
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,897
Of course she's happy.

168
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,984
-She was so embarrassed.
-"Oh, I'm so bad at this!"

169
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,569
Like that, right?

170
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,987
This is good!

171
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,698
I want this every day!

172
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,576
-That's impossible.
-Even if there's no progress.

173
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,580
Making and eating your own soba.

174
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,292
When he first said, "It's soba!"
I thought he was so stupid!

175
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,544
It's okay!

176
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,297
He was just impressed
that they made their own soba.

177
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,632
That's right.

178
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,468
-Is that what he meant?
-Yeah.

179
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,764
Oh, I thought he didn't know
what he was making until he ate it.

180
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,225
Guess he's not that stupid.

181
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,601
That would be very stupid.

182
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,646
Since we started with such a happy scene,

183
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,232
I feel like we need to prepare ourselves.

184
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,402
I mean, things are messy
at the house right now,

185
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,156
so they want to start us off
with something nice.

186
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,073
Just as a starter.

187
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,120
-So, the main course will be sticky?
-Very sticky.

188
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,540
{\an8}Why don't you sew the sides?

189
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,167
{\an8}What about the string?

190
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,960
{\an8}You can make a hole for it later.

191
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,046
I want to sew it on, too.

192
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,048
-You're gonna sew it on?
-Yeah.

193
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:30,523
For Minori - A "present"
Let's go running again! - Makoto

194
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,654
-You're doing it.
-Wow!

195
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,244
Make a hole between here?

196
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,625
But isn't it too big?

197
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,042
Vertical, right?

198
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,086
Vertical?

199
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,297
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

200
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,676
-Clothes?
-Yeah, she needs an apron, apparently.

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,136
-Apron?
-Apron.

202
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,055
Requested by a friend, right?

203
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,182
-An apron?
-An apron.

204
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,434
Did you eat?

205
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,396
We're going to make curry.

206
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,150
-What's that?
-It ripped just now!

207
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,110
-It's not ripped.
-Look, here.

208
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,071
It's ripped here.

209
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,907
-Oh, this...
-This is...

210
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,992
It's hard to tell where it stops.

211
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,620
Here. Line it up here.

212
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,874
It won't work with this.

213
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,711
-Then how about...
-Minori, do you have plans tonight?

214
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,254
Tonight?

215
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,799
-I'm just staying in.
-For real?

216
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,052
Let's go run then.

217
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,970
-Okay.
-Sounds nice.

218
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,931
-Will it work?
-It should.

219
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,474
You're making curry?

220
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,101
You guys can go run.
Then I'll be...

221
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,021
waiting with my special curry.

222
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,440
Yay!

223
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,488
Amazing!

224
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,324
-Here she comes.
-Yeah?

225
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,578
-Oh, a workout headband.
-What's this?

226
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,746
Nothing.

227
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:51,998
Just a present.

228
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,667
-Did you try them on?
-Yeah, they fit perfectly.

229
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,003
For real?
I thought they might be too small.

230
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,170
Let's go.

231
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,797
-Have fun.
-Can I wear these barefoot?

232
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,883
Probably.
You're not wearing socks?

233
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,385
Are they too small with socks?

234
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,762
I don't know.
I'm sure they're fine.

235
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,304
Go put them on.

236
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,068
What's your usual pace?

237
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,906
I don't think it's that different.
I'm not sure.

238
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,283
Almost there.

239
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,247
-Finished.
-Done!

240
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,582
I'm hot.

241
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,675
{\an8}-How are the shoes?
-They're perfect.

242
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,801
{\an8}SHIBA PARK, TOKYO

243
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,094
{\an8}-They're really light.
-They are, right?

244
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,221
Yeah, they're good.

245
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,188
How are things going lately?

246
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,065
What does that mean?

247
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,316
Lately?

248
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,070
-Like what?
-Anything.

249
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,238
Anything?
Well, work...

250
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,324
-Oh, did you quit already?
-Not yet.

251
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,201
-At the end of the month.
-End of October?

252
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,828
End of October.

253
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,664
-What about baseball? Over soon?
-October 18th.

254
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,248
-That's the end?
-The end.

255
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,460
And so until then...

256
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,796
as Uchi and Yuki suggested,

257
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,632
I need to focus on baseball.

258
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,468
So I can't...

259
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,887
really do anything for you.

260
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,518
That's why I asked you
to run with me tonight.

261
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,522
And gave you the shoes.

262
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,525
So, until the season is over,

263
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,571
I wanted to close the gap between us.

264
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,908
After the season, when I have more time,

265
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,244
maybe we can go somewhere.

266
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,412
That's what I was thinking.

267
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,045
{\an8}AOYAMA, TOKYO

268
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,797
{\an8}I heard you wanted to talk to me?

269
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,048
{\an8}IMAGE
MINORI NAKADA'S MODELING AGENCY

270
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,383
{\an8}What is it?

271
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,468
{\an8}MATSUMOTO ERINA, AGENT

272
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,470
{\an8}I've decided to quit my part-time job,

273
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,890
and mentally focus on modeling.

274
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,561
Also, financially speaking,
if I keep my part-time job,

275
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,648
I may not focus on modeling because of it.

276
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,483
I figured that wouldn't be good.

277
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,984
I see.

278
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,154
You want to model for fashion magazines?

279
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,200
Well, I'm not sure about shows.

280
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,620
I think you have a chance.

281
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,247
-Height-wise?
-Height-wise and, well,

282
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,707
there are different shows.

283
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:45,087
I'll have you go to castings.

284
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,633
This first year might be tough.

285
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,427
-But let's work at it.
-Yes, thank you.

286
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,474
{\an8}The place is pretty well hidden.

287
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,395
-It was so fun.
-Was it?

288
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,648
-I'm still in the clouds.
-Really?

289
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,817
Well, if we see it so up close...

290
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,235
-Yeah, it was close.
-Yeah, it was nice.

291
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,324
{\an8}AOYAMA, TOKYO

292
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,994
Cheers!

293
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,457
The color changes when you mix it.

294
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,960
It's totally different.

295
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,294
It's been a stylish day.

296
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,379
Yeah, it was fun!

297
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,966
And I knew some of the songs.

298
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,009
-I was surprised you knew some.
-Oh, yeah?

299
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,303
I'll listen to jazz
while studying tonight.

300
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,056
The studying's going to get
harder for you, right?

301
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,602
Yeah, exams are coming up.

302
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,691
I thought by living in <i>Terrace House,</i>
I'd naturally mature,

303
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,360
or be able to change somehow.

304
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,112
But I think I was naive.

305
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:58,703
Up until now,
I've been kind of passive with everything.

306
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,748
I think I need to change that.

307
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,253
So, I think...

308
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,464
I...

309
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,302
I've been thinking lately.

310
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:21,601
You remember I once told you about
how I broke up with my ex?

311
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,646
It was a pretty tough break up,

312
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,397
and by coming to <i>Terrace House,</i>

313
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,066
I thought maybe I'd find
a new relationship

314
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,943
and be able to forget him.

315
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,864
But I haven't.

316
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,242
And yesterday,
he messaged me something like,

317
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,663
"Hope you're doing well.
Take care of yourself."

318
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,668
And the feelings I've been holding back...

319
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,463
all of them sort of came out.

320
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:56,010
I think I should take the initiative
and call him,

321
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
and tell him...

322
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,015
I miss him.

323
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,934
Here it is.

324
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,311
I think that's good.

325
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,151
I don't know what he'll think about it.

326
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,365
I'm going to tell him how I feel.

327
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,410
That's good.

328
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,622
Maybe that's weird to say.

329
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,209
You've been...

330
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,672
listening to a lot of my issues, so...

331
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,635
thank you.

332
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,889
I haven't told any of the others.

333
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,814
I wasn't sure
if I should tell you this today or not.

334
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,191
Yeah.

335
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,195
-It's a good day.
-A good day.

336
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,906
A good day.

337
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,451
-Shall we head out?
-Shall we?

338
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,912
Let's go home.

339
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,708
Okay.

340
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,461
-It's hell!
-Out of the blue.

341
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,340
-Oh, Tap!
-Poor Tap.

342
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,259
I know how you feel.

343
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,928
-I feel so bad for him!
-Seriously.

344
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,807
Did you see his expression toward the end?

345
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,226
It was classic.

346
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,436
"I can't show it, I can't show it.

347
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,731
I can't show my shock.

348
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,192
I have to smile.
'It's a good day.'"

349
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,653
He squeezed it out,
that "It's a good day."

350
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,946
He did.

351
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,823
-That was brutal.
-Brutal.

352
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,785
When she was saying
she should take initiative, he thought,

353
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,871
"Oh, maybe she's telling me she likes me?"

354
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,289
I thought so, too.

355
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,207
I really thought so.

356
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,961
It's not a presumption at all.
Anyone would take it that way.

357
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,173
-Any normal person would think that.
-Quite normal.

358
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,716
-Tap is not at fault.
-It's not Tap's fault at all!

359
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,762
She must have known how Tap felt.

360
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,471
That's right!

361
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,890
That really sucks.

362
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:10,269
-Well, yeah.
-I mean, he kept asking her out.

363
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,148
She built some relationships in the house,
appeared on television,

364
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,943
and then got to go to Blue Note for free,

365
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,529
had dinner, felt him going for her,

366
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,240
so she dropped the ex-bomb.
The end.

367
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,786
-It wasn't like that.
-It's a theory.

368
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,080
One theory.

369
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,959
But for the ex to call at this timing
is so arrogant, right?

370
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,668
Really arrogant.

371
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,212
Arrogant!

372
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,049
He probably saw her on TV and thought,
"Hey, she looks pretty good."

373
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,885
Yeah, he probably thought
maybe one more time.

374
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,848
Just one more time.

375
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,724
Hey.

376
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,893
You mean he wants to see her, right?
Sorry.

377
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:55,731
But what about Makoto?
He was pretty much saying he liked her.

378
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,691
-That's right, he did.
-He did.

379
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:03,614
But when Makoto told her
he wanted to close the gap with her,

380
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,116
she had no reaction.

381
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,119
Well, if you're having doubts
about that person...

382
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,203
Yeah.

383
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,247
And he reminded her
that he bought her shoes.

384
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,874
That's right!

385
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,167
Did he need to bring that up?

386
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,837
That's what I don't like about him!

387
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,090
{\an8}-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

388
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,637
{\an8}-Uchi's sleeping.
-He's asleep?

389
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,264
Oh, yeah.

390
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,849
How was it?

391
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,560
It was good.

392
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,312
-The jazz?
-Yeah, the jazz was good.

393
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,232
-For real?
-But after that...

394
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,818
Many things.
No, not many...

395
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,487
What is it?

396
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,239
We ate out.

397
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,117
-Where?
-I'm still trying to process stuff.

398
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,161
What? What?

399
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,204
Stop teasing me.

400
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,291
I'm not trying to tease.

401
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,169
I guess her ex messaged her,

402
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:02,089
"Hope you're doing well.
Take care of yourself."

403
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,178
Yuriko's feelings have turned to him.

404
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,595
They have?

405
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,889
So she told me.

406
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,224
She said that?

407
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,228
I took it in at first
and wished her good luck.

408
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,399
On the surface, anyway.
But now that I've thought about it,

409
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,818
-it's like, "What?"
-That's true.

410
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,613
So right now I'm at, "What?"

411
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,574
Makoto...

412
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,286
that's where I'm at.

413
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,205
-Right now?
-Yeah.

414
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,414
Right now.

415
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,584
Man, I played it cool.

416
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,295
Totally cool.

417
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,755
It was kind of a classy restaurant.

418
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,758
With a fork and a knife, and everything.

419
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,140
I couldn't say,
"Well, if it doesn't work out with him..."

420
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:59,355
I cheered her on,
but it doesn't feel good.

421
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,609
{\an8}I thought that,
if I lived in <i>Terrace House,</i>

422
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,487
I'd be able to forget him eventually.

423
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,282
But I haven't.

424
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,370
So, I think I'll meet with him again.

425
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,746
You asked him?

426
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,581
No, not yet.

427
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,542
-You're going to ask?
-I think I'll ask him.

428
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,672
What's wrong?

429
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,050
That's good.

430
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,970
And you know about Makocchan?

431
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,765
I said I was interested in him.

432
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:39,270
And that wasn't a lie...

433
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,690
but maybe I was just trying
to force myself to forget my ex.

434
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,944
What about Yuki?
You're not interested at all?

435
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,448
Yuki? Yuki is really...

436
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,619
I can only think of him as a friend
I can easily talk to.

437
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:02,418
I think I've been holding it back, but...

438
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,129
you know...

439
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,756
I kept trying to forget...

440
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,759
but I guess I couldn't.
