1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,222
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,934
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,144
{\an8}living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

4
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,270
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

5
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,816
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,651
{\an8}There is no script at all.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,944
{\an8}That's right.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,737
So, last week--

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,031
-They were in the pool.
-Yes, they were.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,825
Yes, there was a pool scene.

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,790
{\an8}<i>Minori has something good going on.</i>

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,874
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,959
{\an8}<i>Yeah.</i>

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,627
{\an8}<i>She does.</i>

15
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,128
{\an8}<i>She's got a nice body.</i>

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,380
Just like her name, Minori has blossomed.

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,967
-She's bountiful all around.
-What?

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,385
-Dirty old man!
-We've got a dirty old man here.

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,013
And a dirty old man
who can't even speak properly.

20
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,226
-The lowest kind.
-The lowest!

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,811
Buh-buh-boobies!

22
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,648
Well, overall,

23
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:09,069
there's some movement going on,
especially from Mr. Uchihara.

24
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,864
You can see where
their hearts are pointing.

25
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,948
Yes, you can.

26
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,075
Unexpectedly, actually.

27
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,870
{\an8}-Like, Yuriko was around here.
-Yeah.

28
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,121
{\an8}TATSUYA UCHIHARA, 23 YEARS OLD,
HAIR STYLIST

29
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,538
{\an8}But now she's going off like so.

30
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,916
She's come a long way.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,377
Makoto and Mizuki...

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,087
-Yes.
-The barista.

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,757
-There's something there.
-They have things in common.

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,841
Yes, there is.

35
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,010
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD,
4TH YEAR AT MEIJI GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

36
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,427
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD, OFFICE WORKER

37
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,512
{\an8}A game?

38
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,305
{\an8}Who did you lose to?

39
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,851
{\an8}-Let's see. Ura-Gaku.
-Ura-Gaku? From Saitama?

40
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,728
{\an8}We can talk forever about this.

41
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,188
{\an8}-Yeah.
-So we'll do this again.

42
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,149
-She made that fish meal. The barista.
-Yes.

43
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,358
-Oh yeah!
-Yes.

44
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,153
<i>That definitely scored high with the guys.</i>

45
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,696
<i>-Yes, high scores for that.</i>
<i>-For the women, too.</i>

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,364
<i>I want some.</i>

47
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,991
Do you know the power
of cooking with foil?

48
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,201
I had that for lunch at school,
and it was delicious.

49
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,286
So cute!

50
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,830
You get that for lunch at school?

51
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,374
Did you think that the cooks
were trying to hit on you?

52
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,377
Then there's Tap.

53
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,754
{\an8}<i>Won the Japanese championship...</i>

54
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,173
{\an8}<i>-three years in a row.</i>
<i>-Amazing.</i>

55
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,883
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 27 YEARS OLD, TAP DANCER

56
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,012
He has yet to distinguish himself
to the women.

57
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,015
Yes, they probably
don't know that yet, either.

58
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,434
Right. Once his charms become apparent,

59
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,478
the girls may take interest in him.

60
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,147
That may happen.

61
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,443
What's surprising is that all the women
voted for Makocchan.

62
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,695
-Uh-huh.
-That's right.

63
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,657
Well, there are only three of them.

64
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,158
Which one would it be?

65
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,661
-I guess Makocchan seems calm.
-Right.

66
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,745
{\an8}-Out of the three of them?
-Yeah.

67
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,081
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD, MED STUDENT
4TH YEAR AT TEIKYO UNIVERSITY

68
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
{\an8}Makocchan.

69
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,167
His general vibe is nice.

70
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,713
-Wait, so we're all into him?
-I am surprised.

71
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,216
-So things will move today!
-I want to see!

72
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,514
{\an8}-Cheers!
-Oh, thank you.

73
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,976
{\an8}-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

74
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,185
{\an8}Is here okay?

75
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,436
-Hmm?
-Is here okay?

76
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,855
Sure. Sure.

77
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,858
-And tomorrow?
-Tomorrow I have school.

78
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,317
You already have school?

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,819
I have labs.

80
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,946
Everyone here is in university.

81
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,906
-Yes.
-Uh-huh.

82
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,658
Well, then you graduate.

83
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:21,994
Yup.

84
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,495
What will you do after that?

85
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,872
By then...

86
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:29,918
-You'll be a doctor then.
-Yes, I will be busy as a resident.

87
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,795
Just that?

88
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,255
I think so.

89
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,632
Makoto?

90
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,136
Since I play baseball...

91
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,054
A baseball player?

92
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,306
Yeah, but it's hard to become one.

93
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,976
It would be nice if I could.

94
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,021
Not everyone can, even if they want to.

95
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,148
Well, you're in your fourth year?

96
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,733
Yes, my fourth.

97
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,567
When is the season over?

98
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,653
By the end of October.

99
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,947
Oh, it is?

100
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,616
I would like that to happen for you.

101
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,494
Any thoughts if you don't make it?

102
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,288
Not make it per se, but...

103
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,748
I don't like thinking about it.

104
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,582
-Well, just to have an idea.
-I guess so.

105
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,044
I do want to have a plan B.

106
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,380
It is still exciting
to have all your momentum

107
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,840
focused just on that one thing.

108
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,759
That's true.

109
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,887
So with that, I pass the baton.

110
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,309
The modeling industry may be even harder.

111
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,897
Damn, I'm not good at
conversations like this.

112
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,899
Really?

113
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,985
You've thought about it,
but can't say it out loud.

114
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,695
Yes, I suck at talking about it.

115
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,574
But if you were able to talk about it,

116
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,742
-they could encourage you.
-That's right.

117
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,078
They may be able to help you.

118
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,370
More people will help you.

119
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,874
If we are to live together,
and if we don't know

120
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,709
what each of us

121
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,671
is aspiring for,
it doesn't feel

122
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,465
like we actually live together.

123
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,883
It doesn't?

124
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,719
If we knew each other's ambitions,

125
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,597
and could encourage each other,

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,681
it would be meaningful.

127
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,765
Yes, it would.

128
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,143
And we can enjoy being together.

129
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,022
For sure.

130
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,191
Oh, sorry.

131
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,611
-Why are you using different ones?
-Shall I pour us something?

132
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,530
-Something else to drink?
-Yeah.

133
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,618
When do you want to go for a run?

134
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,329
Anytime.

135
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,081
Anytime?

136
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,540
But how many miles?

137
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,877
Going there and back,

138
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,170
15 to 20 minutes.

139
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,089
How about tomorrow? I can run tomorrow.

140
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,673
-Go run tomorrow?
-Yeah.

141
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,135
Okay. What time? At night?

142
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,388
At night, around 6:00 or 7:00...

143
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,805
-You'll be back?
-I'll be back.

144
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,225
So after we relax a bit
after dinner, we'll go?

145
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,645
-Like around 9:00 or 10:00.
-Really?

146
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,563
Get prepared mentally.

147
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,857
I will during school.

148
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,944
{\an8}HASAKI BEACH
KAMISU, IBARAKI

149
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,925
One more time!

150
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,594
So?

151
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,762
How's it going?

152
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,806
{\an8}For now, we're all into the baseball guy.

153
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,099
{\an8}KAZUKI SHIDA, 20 YEARS OLD,
MIZUKI'S BROTHER

154
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,393
{\an8}-What?
-Yeah.

155
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,228
I'm a little concerned.

156
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,147
About what?

157
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,231
I'm concerned.

158
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,817
If it was someone else, no.
But because it's you...

159
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,778
Why? No need to worry about me.

160
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,988
We can't help it.

161
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,823
-You can't do anything.
-No way.

162
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,450
We wonder
if you are keeping your room tidy

163
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,659
or if you are getting along.

164
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,495
I always get along with people.

165
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,039
While everyone else is having trouble.

166
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,499
-Really?
-Really.

167
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,422
Hey.

168
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,798
{\an8}-Well?
-Let's eat.

169
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,508
{\an8}Thank you for the meal.

170
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,679
Delicious.

171
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm home.

172
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,599
Welcome back.

173
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,142
What did you make today? Okonomiyaki?

174
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,019
-Good timing.
-Yeah, just in time.

175
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,688
-Did you eat?
-No, but I bought some natto.

176
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,858
-There's some left.
-Oh? There's some?

177
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,069
-We can make another serving.
-Really?

178
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,613
Thank you for the meal.

179
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,366
Delicious.

180
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,618
It's 9:30 already.

181
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,454
Running?

182
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,206
Aren't you going for a run?

183
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,749
We'll go run.

184
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,252
It's 9:30.

185
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,503
So at 10:30.

186
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,963
How many miles?

187
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,882
I don't know. I'm letting her decide.

188
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,425
You're running together?

189
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,761
Just the two of them?

190
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,096
Two miles? That's quite a bit.

191
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,973
-Really?
-Maybe not.

192
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,474
Three miles?

193
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,933
Three miles?

194
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,395
Until I'm in pain.

195
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,729
Please.

196
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,107
We'll start just before 10:30.

197
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,566
Okay.

198
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,694
-Can you lend me a jersey?
-For sure. Top and bottom?

199
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,779
Yes.

200
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,572
Okay.

201
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,744
That was delicious. Thank you.

202
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,247
-I'll go get ready.
-Go get ready.

203
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,707
I'll clean up.

204
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,255
Thank you.

205
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,049
-Sure thing.
-Off you go.

206
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,470
I was thinking. Isn't there watermelon?
It might go bad soon.

207
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,972
-Yeah.
-Let's eat it.

208
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,976
{\an8}SHIBA PARK, TOKYO

209
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,063
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

210
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,356
-Want to go? Slowly?
-Okay.

211
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,858
-This way?
-This way?

212
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,694
-Okay.
-Ready to go?

213
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,029
Yes.

214
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,081
You might want to run more later.

215
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,748
No, I won't.

216
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,461
We're going to finish soon.

217
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,046
It doesn't seem so bad.

218
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,343
-It's totally fine.
-Sure is.

219
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,513
-Another round?
-Hmm?

220
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,808
-Another round?
-This might be my limit.

221
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,895
Me, too.

222
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,409
The wind is perfect now.

223
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,911
Sure is perfect.

224
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,622
The wind feels nice.

225
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,834
-We can run together.
-Hey?

226
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,211
Go running again.

227
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,670
-I might ask you to accompany me.
-Hmm?

228
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,382
I might ask you
to come running with me again.

229
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,300
Within reason.
But I am not bad, right?

230
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
Yeah, you are not that bad.

231
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,179
I will try my best.

232
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,098
We'll increase the distance slowly.

233
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,682
Will I get used to it if I keep running?

234
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,393
You will.
Your endurance will improve, too.

235
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,311
-Will I lose weight?
-I am not sure.

236
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,105
Build muscle?

237
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,941
-Somewhat?
-Evenly toned muscles.

238
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,283
I think my work is just straight ahead.

239
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,367
Straight that way?

240
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,951
-What kind of shop is that?
-Hmm?

241
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,036
A clothing store.

242
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,621
-Clothing?
-Yes, an apparel store.

243
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
A boutique.

244
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,794
-The rain is getting worse.
-Yeah.

245
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,629
-Shall we head home?
-Sure.

246
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,299
I'm thirsty, too.

247
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,051
-Want to go?
-Uh-oh.

248
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,011
-What? Is it bad?
-Uh-oh.

249
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,764
-Is it okay?
-It's bad.

250
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,932
Sorry.

00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:27,979
{\an8}Hey.

258
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,856
{\an8}-Oh.
-Hey.

259
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,275
-Is that mine?
-Yup. Thanks.

260
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,693
Sure.

261
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,278
I'll wash the jersey
before giving it back.

262
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,364
-Why are you smelling it?
-He is smelling so hard.

263
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,491
You are smelling so hard.

264
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,118
-It won't smell.
-It doesn't smell.

265
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
Makocchan,
your laundry doesn't smell either.

266
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,749
You look tired.

267
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,085
I will sleep well.

268
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,549
Why are you smiling at me?

269
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,721
Well, you two seem to have fun...

270
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,473
going for a run.

271
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,892
-You up early tomorrow?
-No.

272
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,477
Hit the pool again?

273
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,686
Blue?

274
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,313
-Huh?
-The blue swimsuit?

275
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,982
-Hmm?
-Have you brought many kinds?

276
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,567
No, I just have the blue one.

277
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,818
-Ah, the blue.
-Only the blue.

278
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,612
You remember it well.

279
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,364
When you guys came in,

280
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,658
he yelled, "Blue!"

281
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
I heard it.

282
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,452
-You probably heard it.
-Yes.

283
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,203
You have the kind of bum he likes.

284
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,373
The kind of bum I like?

285
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,584
Yay.

286
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,169
-Yay?
-How about a high-five?

287
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,253
High-five.

288
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,713
High-five.

289
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,798
Yay.

290
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,967
-Okay then.
-It's okay.

291
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,095
-And you?
-Hmm?

292
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,057
-What's that?
-Are you going for Yuriko?

293
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,728
Well, Yuriko drinks too.

294
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,813
A-ha.

295
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,650
So we have a lot of opportunities to talk.

296
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,778
Maybe I'll ask her out for dinner.

297
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,447
-Oh?
-You should ask her out.

298
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,327
-Hmm.
-Whoa.

299
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,330
-Nice.
-That's a nice vibe there.

300
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,582
Is the barista going to be okay?

301
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,750
She seemed annoyed there.

302
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,711
Yeah, she seemed a little irritated.

303
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,588
The barista's swimsuit
was amazing though.

304
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,922
Yes, it was.

305
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,298
What was going on there?

306
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,758
She looked like Doronjo,
the anime character.

307
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,134
It was amazing.

308
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,345
She did.

309
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,056
-The vibe after the jog was really nice.
-Yes.

310
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,642
Like, "Oh, do I have a stain?"
"Oh, where?"

311
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,977
"Oh, it's bad."

312
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,269
-"Sorry."
-"Sorry!"

313
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,188
Like that, right?

314
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,107
Wasn't it nice in the rain?

315
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,401
Yeah, that was super nice.

316
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,696
Then Tap said she has the kind of bum
that Makocchan likes.

317
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,740
-Yes.
-He did say that.

318
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,450
-She said, "Yay."
-Right.

319
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,411
-That expression there--
-Yes.

320
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,538
...is like conveying,

321
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,331
"I'm interested in you,"

322
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,709
-directly to him.
-What?

323
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,004
So if she wasn't really into him,
she would be more like,

324
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,422
"Really? Yay!"

325
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,466
That's it.

326
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,134
That's what I wanted to say.

327
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,719
-Right?
-Yes.

328
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,053
So what does it mean?

329
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,516
So, "You have the kind of bum he likes."
"Yes. This makes me happy a bit.

330
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,809
Wait. I'm taking too long to respond.

331
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:15,312
They might realize
that the comment made me happy.

332
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,898
Yay!"

333
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,525
So that's what it means.

334
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,151
-It's easy to understand.
-I see.

335
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,820
So Minori took a step forward.

336
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,905
That's right.

337
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,866
Yes. I wonder
if the barista will be jealous.

338
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,744
What will the barista do?
I wonder what will happen.

339
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,995
She was irritated for sure.

340
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,623
Then I'm sure you will hear
a high-pitched voice from somewhere,

341
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,500
"What are you guys up to?"

342
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,252
That's Mr. Kobayashi, right?

343
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,463
"Please come here!"

344
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,425
You do a real good mimicking.
All of a sudden.

345
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,259
He disrespects both of them.

346
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,344
My bad. I went overboard.

347
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,597
My bad. Excuse me.

348
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,225
{\an8}So anyways,

349
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,771
how was the, you know, jogging date?

350
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,355
Well, not a date.

351
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,567
-Okay, we went for a run.
-Yes.

352
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,610
-How was it?
-The night run?

353
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,071
-Night run?
-Night run.

354
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,199
It was nice. More so than usual.

355
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,826
-More than usual?
-More than usual.

356
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,661
-So did you have fun?
-Did you have fun?

357
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,246
-It was fun.
-Oh? Do we have something different?

358
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,372
Yes, I changed it.

359
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,749
Really? I'll get angry if there's alcohol.

360
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,586
-Don't worry.
-Why the doubt?

361
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,796
-Can Minori run?
-She can.

362
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,130
-My muscles ache.
-Really?

363
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,425
My hip joints hurt.

364
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,176
-Really?
-Is Makocchan fast?

365
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,345
Well, not really, but...

366
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,805
You've got stamina, no?

367
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,682
Was that a normal pace?

368
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,726
It's a little slow.

369
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,312
You are competitive.

370
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,396
You know?

371
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,149
She did get cramps though.

372
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,568
But I kept running.

373
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,236
Right.

374
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,864
-I'm tired.
-Is that good night?

375
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,324
I also want to "see you tomorrow."

376
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,952
-I'm sleepy.
-Should we start the bath?

377
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,746
-Go for it.
-Have you gone?

378
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,955
No, I haven't.

379
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,208
Go sleep now.

380
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,629
So how was it?

381
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,839
-The night run?
-The night run.

382
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,592
It was nothing too special.

383
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,223
-And you?
-Me?

384
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,018
I'll ask about Minori's side
from her directly.

385
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,394
She's independent.

386
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,896
Oh, right.

387
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,648
-You're the same age, right?
-Yes.

388
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,274
-That's right.
-We're the same age.

389
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,484
That's right.

390
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,779
I'm getting sleepy.

391
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,782
Uh-oh. It's 1:00 in the morning.

392
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,033
Should we go to bed?

393
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,076
I think she'll be done soon.

394
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,828
We'll take turns with the bath.

395
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,830
I'm off to the bathroom.

396
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,917

399
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,822
Done.

400
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,032
Has the season already started?

401
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,160
Baseball is in September.

402
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,246
Sometime mid or late-September.

406
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,592
Sorry for the wait.

407
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,604
-Nice.
-Sexy.

408
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,941
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD,

409
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,988
{\an8}MODEL. FROM SANO, TOCHIGI.
SINGLE FOR 4 MONTHS.

410
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,499
Looks good.

411
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,210
{\an8}Just put "Adachi-kun" wherever.

412
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,670
{\an8}Like we're total strangers.

413
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,088
{\an8}Manners for a stranger?

414
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,172
{\an8}How do you spell "Adachi"?

415
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,508
{\an8}The characters for
"a leg" and "stand up."

416
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,885
{\an8}Adachi-kun.

417
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:14,969
{\an8}-Oh, nice.
-Aw! Cute.

418
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,053
{\an8}ADACHI-KUN

419
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,138
Are the characters correct?

420
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,472
-Aren't they?
-Wouldn't it be sad if it wasn't?

421
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,600
There may be other ways to spell it.

422
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,560
Oh, no.

423
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,688
-It's spelled wrong.
-What?

424
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,982
I think we spelled it wrong.

425
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,735
Sorry, I said it without confirming it.

426
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,029
"Yuki Adachi,
a tap dancer filled with soul."

427
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,906
What? That's amazing.

428
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,867
I wonder what kind of
an amazing person he is.

429
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,036
-It's a little...
-It's kind of dark humor.

430
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,538
I'm sure he'll be a good sport about it.

431
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,456
-Let me see.
-It's not cool.

432
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,500
-It's not bad.
-He's coming!

433
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,294
He's coming!

434
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,087
I'm home.

435
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,675
Happy birthday!

436
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,176
Thank you!

437
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,095
-Thank you!
-Happy birthday!

438
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,180
Thank you!

439
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,640
Happy birthday to you!

440
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,724
Happy birthday!

441
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,475
Put your bag down
and be the star of the moment.

442
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,644
-Sit over there.
-Please sit here.

443
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,771
This is great.

444
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,855
Huh?

445
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,650
{\an8}-We got it wrong.
-It's wrong.

446
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,276
{\an8}So sorry.

447
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,360
I'll put it on anyway.

448
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,570
Thank you!

449
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,572
Happy birthday!

450
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,825
-So?
-So?

451
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,577
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

452
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,498
Thank you so much!

453
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,170
Ta-da!

454
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,546
Ah! It's so cute!

455
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,882
They're swim trunks.

456
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,300
Practice shorts.

457
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,969
-Practice shorts?
-Practice shorts.

458
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,220
Thank you!

459
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,305
Here we go.

460
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,515
Three, two,

461
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,726
one.

462
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,853
Yeah!

463
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,396
-I totally closed my eyes.
-Whose phone is it?

464
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,315
-It's mine.
-Makocchan's?

465
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,777
So, when did you start tap dancing?

466
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,529
Tap dancing?

467
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,032
Around seven years old.

468
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,159
-Wow.
-Around grade one or two.

469
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,410
Seven years old?

470
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,830
Then I went abroad to study.

471
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,664
Is New York the best place for tap dance?

472
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,000
I guess so.

473
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,752
I went to a vocational school there.

474
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:11,878
Oh.

475
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,923
For about two years,
and I performed there, too,

476
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,508
while I was studying.

477
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,635
We want to see you perform.

478
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,137
When can we see you perform?

479
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,850
The soonest would be
the 4th of September.

480
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,934
I can go!

481
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,019
It's summer break.

482
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,103
-Really?
-I can go.

483
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,396
We'll all go.

484
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,688
-At night?
-At night.

485
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,274
-I can go at night.
-Let's go.

486
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,026
-8:00 start.
-8:00?

487
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,319
How long will you tap dance?

488
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,695
-Forever.
-Forever?

489
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,572
-Tap for your whole life?
-Until you die?

490
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,491
-That's cool.
-Sure, I guess.

491
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,787
Well, instead of just talking about me,

492
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,750
I wonder how we can share
our visions for the future

493
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,170
and live together.

494
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,421
Like, what do we strive for?

495
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,757
I don't want to be just...

496
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,342
all casual, like, "Hey, whatever."

497
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,678
It's not like your ambitions, but...

498
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,932
-I think it would be good to know.
-Right.

499
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,018
I do have a clear vision,

500
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,978
like how we've talked about it before.

501
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,815
-Both my parents are hair stylists.
-Is that right?

502
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,192
I looked up to my parents,
which is probably why

503
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,777
I chose to become a hair stylist.

504
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,822
So as a hair stylist,
you'll develop your trade,

505
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,448
and then what?

506
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,908
You'll be independent?

507
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,452
Somehow, I want to go overseas.

508
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,536
Right.

509
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,246
You're a little different there.

510
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,582
-You're in medicine.
-Yes.

511
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:36,087
My father is also a cardiologist.

512
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,171
Is your father a doctor too?

513
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,673
-Yes, he is.
-So cool.

514
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,384
That's why I wanted to become a doctor.

515
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,511
How about you, Minori?

516
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:50,142
I haven't really decided yet.

517
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,107
I'm not even sure
if modelling really suits me.

518
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,820
I haven't really thought about
what I would do in the future.

519
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,029
They say to think of

520
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:06,117
where you want to be when you're 50.
Then trace the steps back.

521
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,452
I wrote that out when I was 17.

522
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,205
Yes.

523
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,457
Isn't it amazing to write it out?

524
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,167
And you did that?

525
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,253
When I get older,
I want to have my own shop.

526
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,337
How should I explain?

527
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,881
Like, how old?

528
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:21,924
Yeah, like from what age...

529
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,968
At what age would you consider someone
an older woman?

530
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,012
What kind of shop?

531
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,388
-Maybe a café.
-A hostess bar?

532
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,641
-Shut up.
-A bar matron!

533
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,101
Why a café?

534
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,311
Well, I like coffee.

535
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,981
Most of all, I like people.

536
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,652
So I want to create an environment
where people can gather.

537
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,989
I like traveling and accessories.

538
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,284
And I like people and coffee.

539
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,327
And interior design.

540
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:55,166
So what I want
is to gather all these things I like

541
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,254
so all the people I like
can easily get together.

542
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,590
It's not that clear.

543
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,427
I kind of spaced out.

544
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,097
Like, I wasn't getting anything
even though you've talked a lot.

545
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,182
Really?

546
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,600
It's confusing.

547
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,936
For most people.

548
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,230
-It's unclear.
-Like, where will it be located?

549
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:22,068
Let's say out loud what we're doing now,
and what we want to do.

550
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,694
Clearly.

551
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,654
Futsal and coffee.

552
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,239
And do what with it?

553
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,326
I want to make futsal big.

554
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,497
And I want to do something
with coffee in the future.

555
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,875
-As your career?
-Yes, and make the environment I like.

556
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,463
Mizuki, I think
you need to take things a bit further.

557
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,924
-You are being rather general.
-General?

558
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:50,554
-Well, I'm--
-What I thought I wanted was that...

559
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,352
I would work hard
and then get married in my 30s.

560
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,771
Well, it's different for a man
than it is for a woman.

561
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,732
But after I went to university

562
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,900
-and studied hard--
-Are you okay?

563
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,368
It would make me happier...

564
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,829
if everyone had some kind of ambition.

565
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,081
I thought...

566
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,834
I was doing things with certainty.

567
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,879
But I couldn't make you understand that.

568
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,216
Though I do seem to get lost in it.

569
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,177
I don't know what to say.

570
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,637
I'm sorry.

571
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,888
What's wrong, Yuri?

572
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,473
Why? Why are you crying?

573
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,933
What's wrong, Yuri?

574
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:42,314
Mizuki was trying so hard to talk it out.

575
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:47,861
Yuki clearly figured out what it is
that you want to do.

576
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,281
Still...

577
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:55,161
It's heartbreaking to watch.

578
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,455
Well, we're lucky to be here.

579
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:02,751
Of course it's easier if
we knew each other's goal.

580
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,380
This will all be over in a few months.

581
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,674
I want to make sure that while we're here,

582
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,926
to build the bond that lasts beyond that.

583
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,347
I don't want to play house.

584
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,473
For sure.

585
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,684
That I have to tell you.

586
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,189
-Whoa.
-What?

587
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,107
Suddenly, it got all dark.

588
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,775
I think we found the heel of the season.

589
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,319
He is hopeless.

590
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,739
He made other people
talk about their dreams,

591
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,616
but meanwhile he's like,

592
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,910
-"I wasn't getting anything."
-That's it.

593
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,371
Can't you understand anything,
you jackass?

594
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,124
I know!

595
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,335
And after he points it out,

596
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,254
he's making faces, grinning and whatever.

597
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,340
That really gets me.

598
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,970
It's like, "Woops!
I think that stung a little."

599
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,682
No, no. His chin wasn't out like that.

600
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,101
His chin wasn't all crooked.

601
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,769
-Like this?
-No, not like that.

602
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:07,065
Well, he has danced stoically
since he was young.

603
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,652
So he is rather hard or strict
on others.

604
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,280
Not everyone can live stoically
from the age of seven, you idiot.

605
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,656
Exactly.

606
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,243
Forcing that kind of value
is what I hate the most.

607
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,120
-I don't even know my goal now.
-That's right.

608
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,871
We do just about anything.

609
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,541
If I met him, I would get in trouble.

610
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,626
Right.

611
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,085
"You still haven't decided?"

612
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,962
I am scared!

613
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,547
"You're going to die soon!"

614
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,261
I'll get in trouble.
I really don't want to meet him.

615
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:39,140
I guess we don't like him 'cause of that,
but what do you think?

616
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,058
I actually like that type of person.

617
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,144
What?

618
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,020
-There it is.
-Why?

619
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,231
It's horrible! Disapproving everything.

620
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,650
Well, I grew up with that kind
of environment.

621
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,943
I was relating to that as I watched.

622
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,488
So if you don't clearly have ambitions,
they won't materialize?

623
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,574
I think we stink of unworthiness
right now.

624
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,952
-It's not good.
-It's not good.

625
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,496
The stink of unworthiness.

626
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,790
The kind that clogs up your nose.

627
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,333
-It doesn't come off.
-It won't come off.

628
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,668
Even if I shower.

629
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,296
-It's stuck.
-It's gone way up your nose.

630
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,088
I'm choking! Hack! Hack!

631
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,300
Okay, so,

632
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:18,554
it's possible she's crying
because she realized that.

633
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,888
So in a way,

634
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,392
the barista may have been touched by that.

635
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
I see.

636
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,936
Hmm. Could it be that?

637
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,647
So that's what you see
if you observe it with a pure heart.

638
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,731
Right.

639
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,318
-It's after this.
-After this.

640
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,070
Right? Depending on what Tap brings out.

641
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,948
She may think like,
"What that guy said was right,"

642
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,367
and something might change
how things are going.

643
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,703
Do you think she's grateful?

644
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,163
If I were her,
I would hate that guy forever.

645
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,667
I would never forgive him.

646
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,461
Wouldn't you say something back online?

647
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,088
No, I would think to also do my best
and strive for something.

648
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,506
What's with you, man?

649
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,842
Stop it.

650
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,135
-Don't speak to him like that.
-Stop it.

651
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,347
-Please don't fight.
-What're you saying?

652
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,519
-That was shocking.
-Yeah.

653
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,646
Yes, it was.

654
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,523
In so many ways.

655
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,401
-Though I do think he's right.
-I guess so.

656
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,027
If you don't have a vision,

657
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,947
-for both people, it's unpleasant.
-You can't support them either.

658
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,784
Don't you think
he shouldn't have gone that far?

659
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,786
But crying won't help.

660
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,248
-Crying won't--
-It really won't help.

661
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,208
Then the conversation is over.

662
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,882
Hmm.

663
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,802
So this is what it's like
on the second floor.

664
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,472
-Right. This is what it's like here.
-Have you been here before?

665
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,766
-No. It's my first time.
-I see.

666
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,184
-Have you?
-No.

667
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,232
While listening to the conversation
with Mizuki,

668
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,942
I was wondering what you thought.

669
00:28:56,026 --> 00:29:01,031
Because there wasn't
something concrete, so...

670
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:06,578
I wanted to help her clarify
by sharing my vision and dream.

671
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:10,457
Even if I talked endlessly
to someone who is not as passionate...

672
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,337
something might resonate
within that person.

673
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:20,384
So I wanted Mizuki to talk about it
and then support her,

674
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,093
whatever it is.

675
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,972
Is it not okay if you're in
the process of figuring it out?

676
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,850
That's okay.

677
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,102
But what's important

678
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,898
is what you want to do right now.

679
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,110
Right. There's no right or wrong to it.

680
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,195
Well...

681
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,948
So it's just...

682
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,410
talking about it today

683
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,120
was fun.

684
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,624
-Thank you.
-I mean, I cried, but I had fun.

685
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:57,754
Since most of my friends
are also in medicine

686
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,592
and that's all we talk about...

687
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:06,305
so I thought I could ask something
totally different.

688
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,015
I would think that I should just shut up.

689
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,687
What's that?

690
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,191
I'm not thinking that.

691
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,322
I'm glad we talked.

692
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,660
Well, next time...

693
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,497
let's go have a drink.

694
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,750
Yeah, I want to talk again.
For sure.

695
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:41,047
There's one thing I want to ask.
Good night.

696
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,552
I want to ask how the night run went.

697
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:46,845
I want to know what happened.

698
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,847
I mean, Makocchan seemed happy.

699
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,432
-Really?
-Yeah, he had fun.

700
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,353
He was all smiling
despite being all sweaty.

701
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,646
But that's all he said, right?

702
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,314
Right, so...

703
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,109
I wanted to ask you.

704
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,738
I was just wondering
why he asked me to go.

705
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,157
On the contrary, is there somebody
you would rather be with?

706
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,370
-I guess Makocchan.
-Makocchan?

707
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,580
Why?

708
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,832
He's easy to talk to.

709
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:20,045
Like, how it's easy to talk with you,
but in a different way.

710
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,422
I think that's good.

711
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,384
I think that's great.

712
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,093
Give it your best.

713
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,388
-What's with you?
-What's with me?

714
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,014
Easy now.

715
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,058
Well...

716
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,311
-Are you satisfied now?
-Yes, I'm good.

717
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,771
Aren't you up early tomorrow?

718
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,481
Let's hit the sack.

719
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:45,320
-You're sleeping here?
-I think I'll sleep here.

720
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,405
Right.

721
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:50,033
-Don't catch a cold.
-I think I did.

722
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,453
-Have a good night's sleep.
-Good night.
