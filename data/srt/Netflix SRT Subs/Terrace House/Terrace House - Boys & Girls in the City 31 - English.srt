1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,767
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,393
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,146
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,236
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,614
Last week...
Oh, yes, the loungewear incident.

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,074
They made up in the end.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,160
-Yes, even after Rikopin's talk...
-After the talk with Hansan.

10
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:39,414
...she still didn't understand
until after talking to Hansan.

11
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,960
However you may feel,
the fact Misaki got angry means

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,963
you didn't consider her enough.

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,339
It depends on each person.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,591
<i>She didn't look like she accepted that.</i>

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,427
But they did have dinner together.

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,845
-They did.
-They did.

17
00:00:53,929 --> 00:01:00,519
I think I did say things
without considering your feelings.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,980
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,899
It's okay.

20
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,444
There's another big incident.
The one that's been dragged out until now.

21
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,571
Yes.

22
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,657
I like you, Hikaru.

23
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,206
So, if you feel the same way...

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,417
I'd like to go out with you.

25
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,087
That's how I feel.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,465
But going by Hikaru's expression...

27
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,718
-It might be a no.
-Yeah.

28
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:38,098
Throughout the entire date,
we all said Hikaru's heart wasn't in it

29
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,436
Yeah, going by his attitude...

30
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,895
The level of excitement was uneven.

31
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,315
-He hasn't given his answer yet, though.
-That's right.

32
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,192
We're just making assumptions.

33
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,196
-He might say yes.
-Yeah, it could be the opposite.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,782
-It might be "Me too."
-What?

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,330
I invited you out today so that...

36
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,166
I can tell you...

37
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,419
how I feel.

38
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,672
Thank you.

39
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,967
I was attracted to you at first...

40
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,638
so I invited you out on my bike.

41
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,476
And as I got to know you,
there were good things,

42
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,935
but I saw the bad, too.

43
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,979
Like...

44
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,400
I feel like you don't know yourself.

45
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,194
You're insecure.

46
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:37,074
And it's those core elements to you
which I don't really like.

47
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,829
So I didn't invite you out a second time
because I put my feelings on hold.

48
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,501
But you asked me out,
and it genuinely made me happy.

49
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,005
And I thought, "I want to go," so I came.

50
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,760
But I don't like you like that.

51
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,012
-I understand.
-So, I can't go out with you.

52
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,100
I understand.

53
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,269
But for you to suggest
what is core to me...

54
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,232
makes me really sad.

55
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,819
So I...

56
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,115
I'm going to try my best
to show you otherwise...

57
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,325
from now on.

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,792
I appreciate you telling me
how you feel.

59
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,338
Okay.

60
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,174
Shall we go home?

61
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,057
It's so pretty.

62
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,772
I guess Yokohama is a city of rejection.

63
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,275
-Is it? Has this happened to you before?
-No, no.

64
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,026
-Already experienced it?
-No.

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,571
Maybe people who see the city lights
get rejected.

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,407
What? I've never heard that before.

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,166
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

68
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,501
Welcome back.

69
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,961
How was it?

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,178
You seem exhausted.

71
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,097
-You're so down.
-Yeah, really down.

72
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,974
She confessed her feelings to me.

73
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,020
She told me...

74
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,734
but I rejected her.

75
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,198
You couldn't see her that way?
She's just a friend to you?

76
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,492
As I got to know her...

77
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,827
it never occurred to me...

78
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,831
that I wanted her to be my girlfriend.

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,335
There's no need to feel so down.

80
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,423
But for her to be so forward
and tell me how she feels...

81
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,176
I've never experienced that before.

82
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,304
I've never given a second thought
to rejecting someone.

83
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,891
It's always been like,
"Sorry, I'm out."

84
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,601
I've been pretty cold.

85
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,396
But I live with Misaki...

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,690
and it's not that I don't feel anything.

87
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,945
I can't explain it.

88
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,617
Oh, no!

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,994
Hold on, I'm scared.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,082
-I'm scared.
-You're a little drunk, aren't you?

91
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,043
-She is.
-I'm scared.

92
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,550
Hold on.

93
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,803
Wait, hold on.

94
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,515
Oh, no, don't! Hold on!

95
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,894
Don't cry.

96
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,604
Hold on!

97
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,524
-I'm scared.
-Come here, come here.

98
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,734
-I was rejected.
-No.

99
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,990
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

100
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,162
You're scaring me.

101
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,833
I've been anxious all day.

102
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,711
-You're drunk, Nacchan.
-I'm not.

103
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,422
-You said to have drinks ready.
-She's been worried.

104
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,756
Thank you.

105
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,845
Thank you, guys...

106
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,055
for all your support.

107
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,390
It's okay to cry.

108
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,310
Thank you, guys.

109
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:44,279
He said I was insecure
and didn't have a strong sense of self.

110
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,991
Or that's what he thought.

111
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:54,456
That's what put an end
to his feelings for me, I guess.

112
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,375
Are you okay with that?

113
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,960
It made me...

114
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,590
want to prove him wrong.

115
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,513
It was hard to hold back the tears.

116
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,815
You're totally drunk, aren't you?

117
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,777
-Wanna drink, too?
-I mean, it's fine, but...

118
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,822
you totally reek of alcohol.

119
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,577
I can't help it!

120
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,122
I couldn't wait otherwise!
Seriously, what time is it?

121
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,999
-I'm sorry.
-It's 1:00 in the morning.

122
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,169
I'm sorry about that.

123
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,587
That's my fault.

124
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:46,883
I've been so anxious,
I had to have a drink.

125
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,886
-Seriously.
-I didn't know that you were.

126
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,471
Sorry.

133
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,850
-It's so cold today.
-Is it?

134
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,601
Oh, is that coffee?

135
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,854
Oh, sorry.
I bought this since we're out.

136
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,273
-Morning.
-Good morning.

137
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,858
I should've asked you.

138
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,819
Have you talked?

139
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,362
-With Nacchan?
-Yeah.

140
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,655
No.

141
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,867
-Do you remember what happened?
-Yeah, totally.

142
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,870
-Really?
-Yeah, I mean, I was balling.

143
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,249
It sucks.
I get rejected and...

144
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,172
Nacchan was drunk or buzzed.

145
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:13,094
Then she started saying she didn't want
to be labeled as a drinker.

146
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:18,058
So she didn't like that I said
she smelt of alcohol...

147
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,686
or that she seemed drunk.

148
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:27,358
She doesn't want to be thought that way
because it might affect her career.

149
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:31,529
So then I told her not to come home drunk.

150
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:36,034
Then she got mad

151
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:41,164
and told me she drank
because she was so anxious for me.

152
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:46,586
Remember when she said
she chose the outfit for me?

153
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,547
-She did.
-That's right. She did.

154
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,425
And how she came home for me?

155
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,805
So why would I say things
like that to her?

156
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,350
And you cried
after she said that a couple of times.

157
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,311
You were like,
"Why can't you let me go today?

158
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,648
I was just rejected.
I'm depressed.

159
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,692
I can't think about anything else."

160
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,321
Yeah, I really couldn't.

161
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,074
Plus, I apologized, like, three times!

162
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,119
You did.
You kept saying you were sorry.

163
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:23,331
Then she told me I was lucky
I didn't have to think about anything.

164
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,625
-Of course you think about things.
-Yeah.

165
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,962
She saw everything I went through.

166
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:34,342
I've actually talked to her
about this before.

167
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:39,722
But this time, she did exactly
what I told her she shouldn't.

168
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,892
That means she didn't really take anything
from our conversation.

169
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,103
She's repeating her actions
even though she said she gets it.

170
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,689
Yeah, she can't just say it.

171
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,566
She doesn't understand the issue at all.

172
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,943
But if she can't...

173
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,779
then she can't, right?

174
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,615
If you've already talked to her.

175
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,785
We're not rejecting her as a person.

176
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,287
She has so many great features.

177
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,707
-She does.
-So let's keep that in mind.

178
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,795
-Then let's have a meeting to talk it out.
-Yeah.

179
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,804
What she said made you feel bad, right?

180
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,307
Yeah.

181
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,519
It started
because I didn't like what she said...

182
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:31,065
Well, Misaki came home
after she confessed her feelings, right?

183
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,487
We got ready for it together.
I was really rooting for her.

184
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,283
I felt really anxious for her.

185
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,328
To be honest,
I thought it would turn out well.

186
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,372
So for her to tell me...

187
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,710
I reeked of alcohol...

188
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,923
It really upset me.

189
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,593
I didn't say it then, but...

190
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,265
Well, it couldn't be helped
if you smelled of alcohol.

191
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,102
Misaki told you that you smelt of alcohol.

192
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,440
So if she really thought that,
there's nothing wrong with her saying it.

193
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,360
Yeah, I didn't say she couldn't say it.

194
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,654
I just didn't like it.

195
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,532
I thought you and I...

196
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,410
have talked a good amount.

197
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,499
You've asked
how you can relate to other people.

198
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:35,505
I thought that you had made
progress in the right direction.

199
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,009
But this made me think
you didn't really hear what I said.

200
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,845
Misaki was crying,
saying she was just rejected,

201
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,015
and she couldn't really think about
anything else.

202
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,062
But you didn't let things end there.

203
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,940
You mean how she asked me to forgive her
and I didn't?

204
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,234
You didn't.

205
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:04,409
You demanded to know
why she'd say something like that to you.

206
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,080
You asked her to stop
because it would affect your image.

207
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,543
I think we have talked about
how there are times

208
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,545
you need to restrain yourself.

209
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,380
I understand.

210
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:23,261
You're that kind of person,
and I admire you for it.

211
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,805
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

212
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,642
-You cut your hair?
-I did.

213
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,773
Why don't you use the restroom, Misaki?
Go use the restroom.

214
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,859
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,612
-Excuse me.
-Sorry, you were saying.

216
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,907
But this time...

217
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,660
I don't feel like I need to apologize.

218
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,789
I just said what I felt.

219
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,833
I'm telling you
because you didn't just say it.

220
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,460
It's your attitude and the way--

221
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,755
Well, I had drank.

222
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,340
But...

223
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,385
everyone was heated then.

224
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:09,557
But things got heated
because it was so bad for Misaki.

225
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,309
We had to intervene.

226
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,603
-Yeah.
-It was a bad situation for Misaki.

227
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,146
That day anyway.

228
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,816
Was I really being that demanding?

229
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,695
-You were.
-Yeah, you repeated it twice.

230
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,572
She was balling...

231
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,992
and she was apologizing to you so hard.

232
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,286
That's why I said it was fine.

233
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,790
But the conversation wasn't over, right?

234
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,712
Sorry, I need to step out for a smoke.

235
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,387
It just feels like
this might happen again.

236
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,225
This is the second time, so it might.

237
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:57,021
Even if Misaki's careful,
it could happen again.

238
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,735
So how can we fix it?

239
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,281
When you guys went out for dinner,
did you guys talk things out?

240
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,954
We understood each other then.

241
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,622
But...

242
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,334
after the alcohol thing,
now I'm not so sure.

243
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:24,340
Like, how you can say
I don't have to think about anything?

244
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,511
That part.

245
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,054
Just that part?

246
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,978
Friends don't usually say
things like that.

247
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,939
You knew what I was going through.

248
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,615
I think it would better if I weren't here.

249
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,492
I'll go.

250
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,290
I apologize for the things I've said.

251
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
I drank too much.

252
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,505
I don't feel like it's sincere.

253
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,965
I do really feel that way.

254
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,718
I was drunk and said too much.
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,350
Please continue for now.

256
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,312
I'll go. Good night.

257
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,981
But this is for you.

258
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,993
So, do you feel like it got through?

259
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,411
I give up.

260
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,206
-Too awkward?
-I give up.

261
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,920
It's just gonna happen again.

262
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,136
That was...

263
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,430
scary.

264
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,142
It must have been really bad.

265
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:04,148
We're supposed to be getting worked up
about Hikaru's rejection...

266
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,275
But instead we get another incident.

267
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,322
The rejection was overshadowed
by the she-said-I-reek-of-alcohol trouble.

268
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,824
"Don't say I reek of alcohol."

269
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,743
"I didn't reek of alcohol."
Like that?

270
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,161
"Yes, you did."

271
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,374
That exchange is like
something from <i>Cops</i>.

272
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,001
"Have you been drinking?"
"Of course not.

273
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,421
I took a two-hour nap. I'm fine!"

274
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,093
When someone is hurt or depressed,

275
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,305
you usually try to give that person
all of your attention.

276
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,976
But she tries to add
all her issues on top of it.

277
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,853
-Why?
-"You made me so worried for you!"

278
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,523
Would you be able to say that
to someone who was just rejected?

279
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,858
Yeah, she just said to someone
who came home rejected and crying,

280
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,610
"It's 1:00 in the morning!"

281
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,280
It's unimaginable.

282
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,492
Natsumi tends to say, "I did it for you.

283
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,869
I helped choose your outfit for you.

284
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,330
I waited until 1:00 a.m. for you."

285
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:06,419
Then she gets upset
when someone doesn't show appreciation.

286
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:12,174
Isn't this the third time
this kind of thing happened with her?

287
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,011
The rate of repeated offenses is high.

288
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,513
That's true.

289
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,435
If she stays for all the episodes,

290
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:27,481
then everyone would understand
that she's just like that.

291
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:32,111
She should just convince everyone
by sneering at them.

292
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,655
She could say to Arman,
"Hey, go back to Hawaii."

293
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,867
-That'd be interesting.
-Right?

294
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,371
In the end, she'll be like Takeyama
and just get angry at everyone.

295
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,664
"What's wrong with you?"

296
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,793
They should have a spin-off
where Natsumi just goes berserk.

297
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,086
Yeah.

298
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,882
"We've got another
short-tempered person for you today."

299
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,761
I'm wondering about Hikaru's statement
that Misaki doesn't have a core.

300
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,473
Oh, when he rejected her.
Would you rather talk about that?

301
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,891
-Yeah.
-That's true.

302
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,853
That was an all-out rejection.

303
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,774
"I don't like your core."
That was cold.

304
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,152
Because he lives with her
and cares about her,

305
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,112
maybe he felt like
he needed to give a reason.

306
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,283
Tamosan is an optimistic girl
and wants to prove him wrong.

307
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,912
So it's taking
a positive direction at least.

308
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,790
I'm sorry.
All I can think about is the drunk.

309
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,585
Like, who cares about that?

310
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,088
It's stuck in my mind.

311
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,465
Rikopin...

312
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,052
can we ask you to get her?

313
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,806
Sorry. Because if we go...

314
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,392
Wait. I think it's better if I'm not here.

315
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,977
-You should be here.
-Don't worry.

316
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,021
-It's okay?
-You should be here.

317
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,203
Sorry, Natsumi.
I think it'd be better to talk it through.

318
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,542
We're not rejecting you as a person.

319
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,711
I really want you to know that.

320
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,215
Misaki came home rejected and hurt.

321
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,384
You understand that feeling best,

322
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,261
especially because
you thought it would work out.

323
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,304
She came home depressed.

324
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,099
Because of that...

325
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,856
you needed to hold back
some of your own needs.

326
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:38,446
And helping her with her outfit
and anxiously waiting for her...

327
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,407
it's really great of you.

328
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,910
There's no need to say it.
It's already understood.

329
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,498
Are you even listening?

330
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,419
I am. Of course I'm listening.

331
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,719
I have to try to get along.

332
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,432
I know I have to put in the effort.

333
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,727
I know that's the best solution.

334
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,940
But being here, trying to get along...

335
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,859
is that fun for you?

336
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,570
-Are you just forcing yourself?
-I don't know.

337
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,449
After Hansan talked to me...

338
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,703
when we talked at his atelier...

339
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,664
since then...

340
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,168
I thought it over
and tried to act accordingly.

341
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,464
But in that situation...

342
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,716
I guess that part of me came out again.

343
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,804
I feel like it's just gonna happen again.

344
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,351
She's probably back to herself again.

345
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,395
I'm trying my best to change.

346
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,193
But if I slip even a little
in that kind of situation,

347
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,612
someone says, "Oh, she's reverted."

348
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,994
I know that the solution
is for me to change.

349
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,413
I'm saying it because I think it.

350
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:18,212
I've been trying to change
since Hansan talked to me.

351
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,589
But it's hard to change.

352
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,179
I am really sorry
about the things I said the other day.

353
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,729
So please don't say,
"Oh, it's just gonna happen again."

354
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,652
I'm proud of you for apologizing.

355
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,533
But to be honest,
I don't know you anymore.

356
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,744
I don't know what's real and what's not.

357
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,038
Right now...

358
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,584
I don't know you.

359
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,879
What do you mean by what's real?

360
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,841
I'm thinking
that everything you showed me...

361
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,177
wasn't the real you.

362
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:11,724
Her emotions really came through
in her apology right now.

363
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:16,228
She didn't just say it.
She apologized and tried to change.

364
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,815
-I felt the emotion.
-Yeah.

365
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,652
Is it still not enough for you?
You're still not sure?

366
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:28,741
I'll act the same way I have been.

367
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,952
But if it's so hard,
I don't think you need to force yourself.

368
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,288
I don't think
you have to try to get along.

369
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,583
You shouldn't have to force yourself.

370
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,254
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,590
I'm sorry to you too, Hansan.

372
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,179
The end!

373
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,722
I think we're done here.

374
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:57,686
Let's all make the effort...

375
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,397
to get along.

376
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,899
Cheers.

377
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,025
Again?

378
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,802
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

379
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,304
-It smells good.
-It's scrambled eggs.

380
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,141
Riko said her throat hurts.

381
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,810
It might be a cold.

382
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
A cold?

383
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,482
I wonder if it's our fault.

384
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,317
That's what I was thinking.

385
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,371
I couldn't apologize yesterday, but I...

386
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,375
It's between you and me,

387
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,795
and I played a part, so I'm sorry.

388
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,132
I'm sorry too.

389
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,512
It's not just us living here.

390
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,727
It really made me realize
I must think about the people around me.

391
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:25,482
If I were in Riko's place, I would've run.

392
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,403
Yeah...

393
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,088
Hansan.

394
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,090
Hey.

395
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,763
How's your work?

396
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,600
I thought I'd have a break,

397
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,771
but it's piling up again.

398
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,567
What's wrong?

399
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,496
I think I'll be leaving <i>Terrace House</i>.

400
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,123
Seriously?

401
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,085
Why?

402
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,423
Well, since the last house meeting...

403
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,885
or the talk...

404
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,347
I've thought...

405
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,767
many things over.

406
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,607
Not long after I moved in,
I had issues with Minori.

407
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,569
Then things happened with Misaki.

408
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,822
I think I've figured out...

409
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,534
what I've been missing.

410
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,913
People can't change overnight.

411
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,415
But now that you're aware...

412
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:09,294
good things may happen.

413
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,632
And so, I really appreciate you.

414
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,260
You're welcome.

415
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,138
We should all do something together.

416
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,268
Yeah, at least have dinner together.

417
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,936
Didn't we say we wanted to barbecue?

418
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,147
-Yeah, that would be nice.
-Let's do it tomorrow.

419
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,232
-Here.
-Seriously?

420
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,026
We can use the grill.
We'll do it tomorrow.

421
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,486
Thank you.

422
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,406
That makes me really happy.

423
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:49,209
The teen is out with a cold
because of all the stress.

424
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,753
She absorbed all the ugliness.

425
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,797
-Poor girl.
-Poor Rikochan.

426
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,259
She's probably thinking
she shouldn't have auditioned.

427
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,054
Yeah, so far nothing nice has happened.

428
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,682
Those heart fluttering moments
of <i>Terrace House</i>,

429
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,268
-she hasn't experienced any of them.
-Not at all.

430
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,270
Only the fights.

431
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:14,109
But things did get resolved that day.

432
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,403
That was crazy.

433
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,740
The way she just said, "Hansan."

434
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,951
-That was scary!
-That was crazy.

435
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,202
But that...

436
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,955
that's a real part of her too.

437
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,668
She's not trying to act cute or anything.

438
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:36,715
It's like there's another Natsumi inside
she has trouble controlling.

439
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,801
-It's Fuyumi. The evil Natsumi.
-Fuyumi!

440
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,513
-There's a Fuyumi.
-That's right!

441
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,893
I mean, the expressions are
completely different.

442
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,186
Fuyumi?

443
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,732
She kept saying
how it still comes out sometimes.

444
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,776
She was talking about Fuyumi.

445
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,320
So by joining <i>Terrace House</i>,

446
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,447
Natsumi was able to confirm
Fuyumi's existence.

447
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,532
-That's right.
-That's it!

448
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:07,412
She can't tell in normal life.

449
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,958
But on the show,
she was able to see Fuyumi objectively.

450
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,752
She did say she realized
what was missing inside her,

451
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,003
and that's why she's leaving.

452
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,589
Wow! I didn't realize this was sci-fi!

453
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,511
The battle between Natsumi and Fuyumi
begins after she leaves.

454
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,223
-Spin-off time!
-Spin-off!

455
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,557
Do they realize it?

456
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,060
She's probably going
to tell her boyfriend...

457
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,604
"Keep filming me."

458
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,190
He's going to have one here.

459
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,733
A GoPro?

460
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,696
-Wouldn't it be more discreet?
-Right here.

461
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,074
I hope Fuyumi makes
another appearance before she leaves.

462
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,868
As she puts her keys down,
Fuyumi will appear

463
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,288
and beat up everyone with the keys.

464
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,166
"Stop it, Fuyumi!"

465
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,002
"Don't do it, Fuyumi!"

466
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,590
-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit!

467
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,012
Delicious!

468
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,224
-It's delicious.
-So good!

469
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,767
Our first barbecue.

470
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,271
Barbecues are nice.

471
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,899
-We should do this more often.
-It's happy.

472
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,277
-We should.
-And we bought a grill.

473
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,903
That's true.

474
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,572
I'll go get more.

475
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,490
The A5-ranked beef?

476
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,785
Here it is.

477
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,245
Wow!

478
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,581
What?

479
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,418
Whoa, it's a solid block!

480
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,714
We haven't had such high quality meat
since the meat incident.

481
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,009
-We can really just cook it as is?
-That's what Arman said.

482
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,053
I said we should cut it.

483
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,388
We might waste another A5.

484
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,560
Wow, are you sure?

485
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,399
-It's like it's not meat.
-Amazing.

486
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,361
I wanna ask a <i>Truth or Truth </i>question.

487
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,404
What question?

488
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,532
Let's go with the craziest experience.

489
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,368
Craziest experience?

490
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,912
A crazy experience...

491
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,122
-You must have a lot, Hikaru.
-Yeah, I do.

492
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,042
It can be anything,
like a bike accident.

493
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,880
-Okay, I've got one. My crazy experience.
-Please.

494
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,139
-Ready?
-Yeah.

495
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,599
What? I'm scared.

496
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,437
I'm... leaving <i>Terrace House</i>.

497
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,149
-What?
-Really.

498
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,359
What?

499
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,119
-Really. I'm serious.
-Seriously?

500
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,079
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

501
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,929
THE SHOW HAS BEEN EXTENDED AGAIN.
TO BE CONTINUED!
