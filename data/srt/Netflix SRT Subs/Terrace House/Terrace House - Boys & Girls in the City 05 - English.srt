1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,431
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,308
{\an8}<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,143
{\an8}6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE.

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,563
{\an8}<i>living together, and we observe</i>
<i>how they interact with each other.</i>

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,024
{\an8}All that we've prepared is
a beautiful home and automobile.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,235
{\an8}-There is no script at all.
-No.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,446
-Unfortunately, Ayumu is absent today...
-Yes.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,365
for reasons related to his being young.

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,242
-"His being young."
-I see.

10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,620
Newspapers referred to him
as a genius child actor.

11
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:37,746
-Wow.
-Is that right?

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,666
Who will lead the movie industry
in the future.

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,375
-Really?
-Wow.

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,128
So, I was afraid I'd be nervous
if I saw him.

15
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,964
-It's a good thing he's absent.
-I'm glad.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,507
-I'll have time to mentally prepare.
-Yes, you have time.

17
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:51,301
In the last episode,

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,888
Makoto and Minori
had grilled meat together.

19
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,181
{\an8}-Yes, yes.
-They had.

20
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,475
{\an8}<i>They're moving quickly.</i>

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,810
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

22
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,936
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD

23
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,981
However, Mizuki, the barista,
showed hostility towards her.

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
-The barista.
-The barista.

25
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,192
-Yes, she did.
-She launched her attack.

26
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,445
It began when Makoto apologized to Mizuki

27
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,323
at Yuki's birthday party.

28
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,369
-That's right.
-"I also had issues about baseball.

29
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,288
I didn't talk about it. I'm sorry."

30
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,791
{\an8}So, Mizuki,

31
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,377
{\an8}it felt like we all kind of
ganged up on you.

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,504
{\an8}MIZUKI SHIDA, 22 YEARS OLD, OFFICE WORKER

33
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,673
{\an8}I should've said this
right then and there.

34
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:30,799
{\an8}MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD

35
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,551
{\an8}Thank you so much
for coming here to say that.

36
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,887
{\an8}-Oh, no, it's inexcusable.
-Don't worry.

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,096
{\an8}-Good night.
-Good night.

38
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,180
{\an8}Good night.

39
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,724
{\an8}MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD, MODEL

40
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,855
{\an8}It made me kind of happy to think
that he was concerned about me.

41
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,691
-Love triangle.
-Right.

42
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:53,906
And then, Yuki and Yuriko had
Japanese sake together.

43
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,783
Ah, Yuriko brought Hepalyse.

44
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,076
-Oh, that.
-Hepalyse!

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,494
That knocked me out.

46
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,204
-She said, "Here."
-That's it, yes!

47
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,831
{\an8}<i>Just like a commercial.</i>

48
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,292
{\an8}<i>-True.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

49
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,879
{\an8}We talked a whole lot when we broke up.

50
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,255
{\an8}YUKI ADACHI, 28 YEARS OLD, TAP DANCER

51
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,966
{\an8}YURIKO HAYATA, 23 YEARS OLD, MED STUDENT

52
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,885
{\an8}Sorry.

53
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,805
{\an8}I just open up so easily to you, Yuki.

54
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,640
{\an8}<i>They promised to have a drink</i>
<i>together again.</i>

55
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,684
-That's right.
-Yes, they did.

56
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,476
I think they're solid.

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,937
-I think they are.
-Is that so?

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,105
They get on my nerves.

59
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,026
Tap showed us many sides.

60
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:37,449
In the boy's room, Yuki was
sort of worried about Tatsuya's feelings.

61
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,368
He said, "Sorry,"

62
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,537
and Tatsuya was like, "Don't."

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,999
Like, you don't need to be conscientious

64
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,044
{\an8}just because I expressed
some interest in Yuriko.

65
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,755
-Like, really...
-Well not so much conscientious--

66
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,132
No, really, I don't care
if it's discourteous.

67
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,302
So, we have two love triangles.

68
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,595
That's right.

69
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,138
-That's true.
-Beautifully.

70
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,682
Isn't this the first time?
Two love triangles.

71
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,436
-That's right. No one's left out.
-That's amazing!

72
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,611
{\an8}Come to the pool with me.

73
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,364
{\an8}Pool, right.
Mizuki's swimsuit.

74
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,451
-That's not what I mean.
-I gotta see Mizuki in her swimsuit.

75
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,746
I hear you've brought several swimsuits--

76
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,498
-But I haven't worn much.
-That's the rumor I heard.

77
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,250
I do have several.

78
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,212
It'll continue raining for the next week.

79
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,132
-I'll make some coffee.
-Yes, sure.

80
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,053
While you're drinking alcohol,
I'll drink coffee.

81
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,473
Six...

82
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,183
seventeen.

83
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,144
-Welcome home!
-Here he comes.

84
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,687
-What towel is that?
-The Giants towel. It's for Chono.

85
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,523
-Ah, Chono. Looks good.
-Who won?

86
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,109
Yakult. We lost.

87
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,653
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

88
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,405
-Amazing. Great timing.
-People are coming home.

89
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,282
-Who wants coffee?
-I want some.

90
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,534
Okay, then I'll make more.

91
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,578
You won't be able to sleep again.

92
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,914
I'm okay. I'll stay up.

93
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,582
-Who else is home?
-Minori.

94
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,919
She rented another scary movie.

95
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,671
I won't watch it.

96
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm scared of horror movies, too,

97
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,342
so let's go see a movie together.

98
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,803
Which one?

99
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,555
-Amazing!
-He goes right for it!

100
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,308
-I'll be on summer break.
-Right, summer break.

101
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,393
More like fall break.

102
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,187
As of the second, right?

103
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,939
-Just the two of you?
-Yes, the two of us.

104
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,356
Really? Sure.

105
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,609
-What's that about?
-What?

106
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,362
-Well, I wanna go, too.
-I wonder if it's ready.

107
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,118
Next time.
Thank you. Is it sweetened?

108
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,830
Not yet. I'll get sugar,
so serve yourself.

109
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,373
By myself?
Please put it for me.

110
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,003
-I have practice tomorrow.
-It is getting late.

111
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,547
I think I'll go to bed.
It looks like it's going to be long.

112
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,383
-Good night.
-I'll leave her to you.

113
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,721
-You're going?
-I'll be relaxing downstairs.

114
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,139
I'll go.

115
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,474
Okay.

116
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,270
-Where do you wanna go on the second?
-Are you off on the night of the second?

117
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,564
-How about in the morning?
-I can take a day off.

118
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,483
-So let's go in the morning.
-Okay.

119
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,318
You make plans then.

120
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,112
-You want me to make plans?
-Yeah, on the second.

121
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,864
-For real?
-Yes.

122
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,157
-I'll think about it.
-Think about it.

123
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,369
-Something I can enjoy.
-What?

124
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,996
Isn't it usually the other way around?

125
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,333
-No, no. Please make plans.
-I'll come up with something.

126
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,336
Have you talked with Minori?

127
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,381
We haven't been able to talk at all.

128
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:44,052
You'd better.
Minori sleeps over there

129
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,304
because she says the bed is too hard.

130
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,474
But for sure there's an issue there.

131
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,935
-You think so?
-Among you girls.

132
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,771
She comes downstairs
and has guy talk with the three of us.

133
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,483
-Is it really that bad between us?
-Hmm?

134
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,735
I was wondering
if the vibe was that bad between us.

135
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,821
I think it is. Already.

136
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,865
I see.

137
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,380
Wow. Isn't it a little too hot?

138
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,511
I'm gonna make more bubbles.

139
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,685
This is good.
Feels like being in some resort.

140
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,149
We took a bath
on the first and second days.

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,985
-The second?
-Did we all go in?

142
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,487
-We took one together.
-Right.

143
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,199
Seems a long time ago.

144
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,202
-All clean?
-Not yet. Still on the eyelashes.

145
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:54,206
The reason I called you out
for a bath is...

146
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,126
-Someone told you something?
-I got called out.

147
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,173
So, do you always sleep
in the living room

148
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,217
because of the problems between us girls?

149
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,221
-That's not true at all.
-Really?

150
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,888
We're making you feel unwelcome--

151
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,724
-Uchi said that?
-Yup.

152
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,851
-Why did he think that?
-I'm not sure.

153
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,104
We didn't talk about that.

154
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,232
He told me you said something like that.

155
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,859
-Makocchan's been sleeping downstairs.
-Is that so?

156
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,569
-He's focused on baseball.
-And has to get up early.

157
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,572
-He says he won't stay up late.
-Right.

158
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:31,284
Makocchan asks me out
at every chance he gets.

159
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,998
Even though he asks me out so much,
I don't know what he's thinking.

160
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,915
What do you mean?

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,503
We keep in contact regularly.

162
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,423
You like him, don't you?

163
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,550
-That's not quite right.
-No?

164
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,761
We could be just good friends.

165
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,557
I don't know.

166
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,894
What could it be?

167
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,397
When we talked about
who made the best first impression,

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,315
we all said Makocchan.

169
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,485
So, I wonder
if that feeling is increasing,

170
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,447
or, like, it's going in
a direction that you want.

171
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,992
Well, I think...

172
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,452
Has it remained the same?
Has the impression stayed the same?

173
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,580
It's the same, I guess...

174
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,628
Well... that's...

181
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,387
Let's eat.

182
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,683
{\an8}-It's risotto.
-Is it good?

183
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,102
It tastes good.

184
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,856
-Uchi, I wanna get a haircut.
-Come to my place.

185
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,899
I wanna do it before the summer break.

186
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,152
-Our salon before the summer break--
-Booked?

187
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,529
We're open only on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

188
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,448
Maybe if you come Monday.

189
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,450
-Are you shaving your head?
-You want it shaven?

190
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,453
No, no. I want it short, though.

191
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,622
I'll ask if there's
an open slot on Monday.

192
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,626
What was the day we're getting together?
Is everyone available?

193
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,505
I'm free on the second.
I'm going out with Mizuki in the morning.

194
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,006
-Really?
-A date?

195
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,425
I asked her to make plans for me.

196
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,097
Oh, you're here. Good timing.

197
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,183
What is this? Some kind of dish?
Minori made a bowl of something?

198
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,311
-Minori's risotto bowl.
-Risotto bowl?

199
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,481
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

200
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,815
I'm back.

201
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,154
-Eggs.
-From the convenience store?

202
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,864
-Yeah. I love it.
-It's super delicious, isn't it?

203
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,078
Yuriko, are you free
on the third or the fourth?

204
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,416
I'm free on the third.

205
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,544
After school, I'm free on the third.

206
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,797
Wanna go somewhere?
In the evening?

207
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,091
Then I'll make plans.

208
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,093
-Really?
-What?

209
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,138
-So, for Yuriko...
-Why, Uchi?

210
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,432
-You, make plans?
-I feel a bit...

211
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,975
No, no. You're wrong.

212
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,353
It's not like that.

213
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:50,692
I believe you should communicate
differently with different people.

214
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,235
-True.
-Yes.

215
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,111
I'll go out with Minori, too.

216
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,364
How about you, Minori?

217
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,783
-I...
-We'll discuss.

218
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,868
-Discuss?
-After we've discussed...

219
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,206
-You'll make plans together.
-Yeah, yeah. We'll plan.

220
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,333
-It's all different.
-It's different.

221
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,837
-Maybe it's time for bed.
-I'm going to bed.

222
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,755
Coming?

223
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,217
-Good night.
-Good night.

224
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,803
-One by one.
-Yes.

225
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,348
-Dating all of us.
-All of us.

226
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,100
-It's funny.
-It is.

227
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,566
What a fucker!

228
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,819
-He's unbelievable.
-Isn't he?

229
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,863
-Totally new.
-He's making moves.

230
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,656
This is a new tactic.

231
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,785
I asked for stimulation,
but this hit me straight in the stomach.

232
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,121
What a fool!
He's too quick.

233
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,456
How does that make women feel?

234
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,707
I don't like it.

235
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,294
It's like,
"You wanna go out with me, right?"

236
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,463
I bet he's been like that all his life.

237
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,385
He thinks every girl he meets
is happy to go out with him.

238
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:03,014
But he differentiates,
letting Mizuki make plans.

239
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,393
"With you, I'll make plans.
With you, we'll plan together."

240
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,521
He shows that he thinks of
each one differently.

241
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,730
He's open in that way.

242
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,399
-No, no, no, no!
-He is.

243
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,651
No, no! Open?
He's nasty.

244
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,570
-The girls said yes.
-Why?

245
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,449
Because of his looks?
If so, this country is done!

246
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,077
-Country?
-That's going too far.

247
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:30,458
Surprisingly, girls who fall for guys
who are open about everything,

248
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,003
don't get angry with them.

249
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,007
A friend of mine is like that.

250
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,592
At his birthday party,

251
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:45,264
all his ex-girlfriends gathered there.

252
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,685
-He was unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

253
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:54,607
But he was so open about it
that everything settled nicely.

254
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,362
I wondered how he could build
such a kingdom.

255
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,823
He might be the same type.

256
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,034
Son of a bitch!

257
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,922
Please have a seat.

258
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,762
-Well, well, well.
-Well, well, well.

259
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,306
-How would you like it done?
-What should I do?

260
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,725
-It's really long...
-Really long...

261
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,893
How do you want it?

262
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,187
Leave the top part a little...

263
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,359
That's what everyone says.
"Leave the top part."

264
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,987
-Let's shampoo, then.
-Let's do it.

265
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,990
-Can I really cut it?
-Yeah, go for it.

266
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,283
Don't get mad.

267
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,245
I won't get mad.

268
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,126
Because after I cut your hair
and we go home...

269
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,294
Your reputation is at stake.

270
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,923
-I'm sure there will be talk.
-Especially from the girls.

271
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,137
-What's funny?
-I'm really nervous.

272
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,807
I'll be on summer break starting tomorrow.

273
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,643
Cool.

274
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,645
I'll have lots of dates.

275
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,565
-Where are you taking Yuriko?
-Well...

276
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,569
to Enoshima Aquarium.

277
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,489
Night Aquarium.

278
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,869
Minori and I will go somewhere big.

279
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,039
-What do you mean, big?
-Mihara-yama.

280
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,000
-You'll climb the mountain?
-We'll climb the mountain.

281
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,460
It's a day trip though.

282
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,212
-Day trip?
-We'll take a ferry to Izu Oshima.

283
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,298
Yeah, we'll go there.

284
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,680
-Does it look okay?
-It looks okay.

285
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,933
What will Minori think?

286
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,935
-That's the focal point?
-Aren't I right?

287
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,437
You're right.

288
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,774
{\an8}I can't wait to see Makoto's new style.

289
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,818
What if he shaved his head?

290
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,487
If it's horrible, I'll blame Uchi.

291
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,533
-How about saying nothing about his hair?
-That's a good idea.

292
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,743
I'm sure he wants your opinion.

293
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,913
-Why?
-He doesn't care what I think.

294
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,458
What would be a good comment?
"Looks good"?

295
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,128
-Here I am.
-Here he is. He's back.

296
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,423
-Welcome home.
-Back from practice?

297
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,966
-Not practice
-Oh, right.

298
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,551
-I got it cut.
-Cut?

299
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,052
-What?
-At Uchi's.

300
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,431
-Did he cut your arms?
-No, Uchi cut my hair.

301
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,015
Uchi cut your hair?

302
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,392
-Right.
-Oh.

303
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,269
It got shorter.

304
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,689
-Isn't that a little slow?
-You got a haircut?

305
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,357
It got much shorter.

306
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,400
-Where?
-Where?

307
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,070
Here. The back.

308
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,404
It's hot.

309
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,281
Tell him what you think.

310
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,659
-It looks good.
-Really?

311
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm glad.

312
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,287
-Looks good.
-Uchi was skillful, but nervous.

313
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,373
-He was nervous?
-He was.

314
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,043
He was glad his first customer was a guy.

315
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,294
It got a lot shorter.

316
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,506
-He cut a lot.
-It looks great.

317
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,217
Is your makeup different today?

318
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,470
A different shade of lipstick gives
a totally different image.

319
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,346
I don't know anything about makeup.

320
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,849
-But you noticed this, right?
-That I did.

321
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,433
But you didn't say anything.

322
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,228
I don't bring up stuff
like shades of lipstick.

323
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,688
But it makes girls happy.

324
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,732
-It does.
-Right?

325
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,192
What do you wanna do now?

326
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,653
Wanna go somewhere?

327
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,447
If we eat out, I want something
we don't cook at home, like fish.

328
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,283
I have an idea.

329
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,910
What?

330
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,914
A place where you eat the fish you catch.
You don't know it?

331
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,415
Sounds fun.

332
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,958
You eat the fish you catch?

333
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,088
-Where?
-It's true.

334
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,717
{\an8}MEGURO, TOKYO

335
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,804
{\an8}ZAUO
FISHING BOAT TEA HOUSE

336
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,975
We're gonna fish.
We're gonna fish.

337
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,771
-What do we catch first?
-Let's see.

338
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,897
I want horse mackerel.

339
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,356
-Yeah, horse mackerel.
-Horse mackerel?

340
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,233
Then this tank.

341
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,820
You can catch lobsters too?

342
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,989
I want lobsters and turban shells too.

343
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,240
CATCH AND FISH
(2 - 4 FISHING POLES)

344
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,867
Which ones are horse mackerels?

345
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,328
-That white-colored one.
-That one.

346
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,123
Come here, horse mackerel.
Come, Mr. Horse Mackerel.

347
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,292
I'll put the hook in front of it.

348
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,294
Come get the bait.

349
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,755
We can't catch any.

350
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,007
Wait.

351
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,176
-Here it comes!
-You got it?

352
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,678
You got it!

353
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,516
-Good catch!
-Thank you.

354
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,145
-How would you like it cooked?
-Sashimi and nigiri sushi?

355
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,314
-Nigiri sushi?
-Nigiri, okay.

356
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,026
Oh, I got it! I caught one!

357
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,111
Good catch!

358
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,281
-What's this?
-Horse mackerel.

359
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,575
-Is this it?
-Yeah.

360
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,076
Incredible.

361
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,370
-What's this?
-It's a chicken grunt.

362
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,372
Not a horse mackerel.

363
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,415
Nice chicken grunt.

364

FISHING MENU

365
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,043
Here you are.

366
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,796
Sea bream sashimi and sushi.

367
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,214
Amazing.

368
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,508
Awesome.

369
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,677
Looks delicious.

370
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,476
-How is it?
-Delicious.

371
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,314
Do you know the market price?

372
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,776
I don't know what that means.

373
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,529
Lobsters are priced as quoted.
It depends on the day.

374
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,782
Depends on the cost price.

375
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,702
Market price. I'll remember.

376
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,080
Any interesting stories lately?

377
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,041
What a direct question!

378
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,210
When you weren't here,
I asked him how things are.

379
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,420
What things?

380
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,840
-What he thinks of you.
-You asked that?

381
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,926
-In a different way.
-Very straightforward.

382
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,137
-What do you think of me?
-Seriously?

383
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,973
"What do you think of me?"
Amazing.

384
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,225
I don't love her or anything,

385
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,979
but I want to get to know her better.

386
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,564
Very simple.

387
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,525
So boring.

388
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,360
Boring?

389
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,364
Like, as if she's just one of the three?
So boring.

390
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,950
It's not like...

391
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,204
Boring, yeah.

392
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,707
-I'll tell everyone.
-Did you expect something more?

393
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,459
-Yeah?
-Definitely something more.

394
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,795
-There was no feeling to it.
-Nothing.

395
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,630
-I think highly of her.
-Highly?

396
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,799
Highly?

397
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,302
You don't think of
all three of them equally?

398
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,724
-You don't, do you?
-Huh? What?

399
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,393
Why are you two talking through me?

400
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,646
No, no. We're talking to you.

401
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,067
-The conversation is directed--
-What's my role here?

402
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,486
It was going this way and that way.
And this way.

403
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,780
-What did you ask?
-You're asking me?

404
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,491
-I don't think that way.
-What do you mean?

405
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,703
I'm interested in Yuriko.

406
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,204
She's up here.

407
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,539
-And I'm here, right?
-What's that?

408
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,665
That's not true.

409
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,418
Why doesn't anybody think of me as a girl?

410
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,337
-I do.
-No, you don't.

411
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,421
I do too.

412
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,507
-She doesn't feel it.
-I don't.

413
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,260
Are you and Yuriko going out somewhere?

414
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,762
-Huh?
-In the future.

415
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,597
-The aquarium.
-You're going to the aquarium?

416
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,642
When?

417
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,352
September.

418
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,856
After my show.

419
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,692
-She's going there with someone else, too.
-Someone else?

420
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,820
-Who?
-Uchi.

421
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,238
Is he taking her there?

422
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,282
He said he was taking her to the aquarium.

423
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,243
Should I have said that?

424
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,372
Does she like the aquarium that much?

425
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,918
But you're taking her first, right?

426
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,585
-No, later.
-What? Later?

427
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,463
He said on the third...

428
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,465
But you asked her first.

429
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,427
-I don't know.
-Uchi did this intentionally?

430
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,722
It seems Uchi was the one
who chose the aquarium.

431
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,850
He did this intentionally.

432
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,603
What?
But wouldn't she decline to go?

433
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,900
So Yuriko is comparing Yuki and Uchi.

434
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,819
That can't be true.

435
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,447
What... is this feeling?

436
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,157
What are you saying?

437
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,534
I'm a confused 28-year-old.

438
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,913
-This is good. Fun.
-Interesting.

439
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,706
It's getting interesting.

440
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,250
It's getting complicated.

441
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,377
-Indeed.
-Not good.

442
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,507
Uchi knew Yuki and Yuriko were going
to the aquarium,

443
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:45,512
but he asked her to go with him
before she goes with Yuki.

444
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,350
-But could he have known?
-Is it a coincidence?

445
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,436
If it was a coincidence,
for Yuriko to accept it...

446
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,687
she's very...

447
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,733
But Uchi hasn't told her
about the aquarium.

448
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,360
-He hasn't?
-I see.

449
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,528
So no one is to blame.

450
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,198
I see.
So, Yuriko is in for a surprise.

451
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,700
-Right.
-And she'll go, "You too?"

452
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,285
"This again?"

453
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,458
But he makes a lot of moves,
so he may simply say, "I just knew."

454
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:19,046
It depends on which one successfully
entertains Yuriko at the aquarium.

455
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,882
He may say things like that.

456
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,717
I want him to have
an overwhelming sense of defeat.

457
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,637
Overwhelming.

458
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,348
I wish we could add
another charismatic hairstylist.

459
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,978
-Makocchan's hairstyle is very good.
-Thankfully.

460
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,813
Man, he has skill, too?

461
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,733
Unfortunately he does.

462
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,403
I wished he'd been just a shampooist
pretending to cut hair for TV.

463
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,446
But no, he can actually cut hair.

464
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,864
Yes, he can actually do it.

465
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,992
Makocchan and Minori are going well.

466
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,493
-Very well.
-It seems good.

467
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,954
That dinner scene was good.

468
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,540
That's how love grows.

469
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,459
"What did you say?"
"Huh?" "Huh?"

470
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,296
-We know you heard it.
-Very cute.

471
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,507
And while he's leading the two of them
in the right direction,

472
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,676
tragedy hits him.

473
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,220
"What? The aquarium? What?"

474
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,306
"My aquarium!"

475
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,225
"My aquarium..."

476
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,644
It's not Monopoly.

477
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,399
-Isn't it getting complicated too soon?
-It's fun!

478
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,277
It's because they know
they have only 18 weeks.

479
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,737
It gets more interesting
if the time is limited.

480
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,991
-You're right.
-We've learned.

481
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,410
If we don't tell them,
they don't do anything.

482
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,584
{\an8}Where are you going, Mizuki?
Have you decided?

483
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,545
Oh, um... let me think.

484
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,591
-Spo-cha.
-Spo-cha. Sounds good.

485
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:50,596
Uchi hasn't told you yet,
but he's been thinking about it.

486
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,307
-Really? He's been thinking about it?
-Yeah, it's a nice place.

487
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,351
Very date-like.

488
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,729
-It's very, very nice.
-Wow, really?

489
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,691
How was Makoto today?

490
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,276
Did you like his hair?

491
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,403
It was good, it was good.

492
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,240
I freaked out while I was cutting it.

493
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,784
You told him about Uchi week, didn't you?

494
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,121
-Uchi week, yeah.
-Which starts today.

495
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,457
-It starts now.
-Now, right.

496
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,044
Are you going to the aquarium
by any chance?

497
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,504
I am.

498
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,047
Me too.

499
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,965
-With whom?
-Yuriko.

500
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,260
-We made the same plans.
-That's right.

501
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,303
Makoto just told me.

502
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,974
-When are you going?
-Next week.

503
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,102
-I'm going on the third.
-You're earlier.

504
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,729
I'm earlier, so I win.

505
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,315
-I win.
-I'm not sure who wins.

506
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,526
Should I postpone?
Because you already made plans.

507
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,736
We ate out together the other night,

508
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,365
and we talked about the aquarium
in our conversation.

509
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,991
Then I'll change my plan.

510
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,495
It doesn't matter either way.
But if we take her to the same place...

511
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,747
-It's not right for her.
-It's not right for her.

512
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,376
-Which aquarium?
-The one in Sky Tree.

513
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,296
I'm taking her to Enoshima.

514
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:09,258
Different aquariums.
What kind of duel will this be?

515
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,676
Right.

516
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,180
-So how is it, Minori?
-How's what?

517
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,265
-Makocchan.
-What do you mean?

518
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,934
Well, the three of us had dinner together.

519
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,772
-Right.
-Naturally, the conversation led there.

520
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,108
-What did he say?
-What did Makocchan say?

521
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,819
He said, "I don't love her or anything".

522
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,530
-He did?
-That's a lie.

523
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,326
From where we stand,
Makoto's totally in love with you.

524
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,536
Really? I'm sure he isn't.

525
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,664
-Really?
-I don't think he's in a hurry.

526
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,833
I think so.

527
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,877
Minori, you don't have to change.

528
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,673
I mean, if he's not acting like
he's really in love with you

529
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,800
and he doesn't admit it,

530
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,636
at least he's fond of you.

531
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,309
But you look so cute.

532
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,186
You look happy.

533
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,106
Nobody thinks of me as a girl...

534
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,065
-Wrong.
-Wrong.

535
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,069
We talked about it over dinner.

536
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,823
Makoto said he thinks of me as one.

537
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,326
He's honest on that point.

538
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,785
Unless he says it clearly, I don't know.

539
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,330
Just make him say it clearly.

540
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:27,169
You're fun to be with,
and he knows you like him.

541
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,964
So the rest is up to him, right?

542
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,508
Right.

543
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,302
Right.
