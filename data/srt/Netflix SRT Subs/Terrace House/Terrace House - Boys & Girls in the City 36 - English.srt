1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,097
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,435
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,313
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,774
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,944
-There is no script at all.
-Not at all.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,949
Last week, Rikopin and Hayato went
to Tsukiji on a date.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>-Yes, they did.</i>
<i>-They had seafood bowls.</i>

9
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,747
And that night,
Hayato went to the girls' room

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,209
-and asked Rikopin out on another date.
-Yes, that's right.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,336
I came to ask Riko out again.

12
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,463
-What?
-Hmm?

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,674
Remember when we first talked
about Yokohama?

14
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,133
What about Yokohama?

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,760
What's in Yokohama anyway?

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,262
The Cupnoodles Museum.

17
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,721
That sounds like fun.

18
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,223
Things seem to be going well.

19
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,933
-It does.
-Yes.

20
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,520
-And Momochan invited Arman to the beach.
-Like, "I wanna go."

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,397
When is she gonna come to her senses?

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,649
Let's go to the beach sometime.

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,984
-Okay.
-Will you take me?

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,110
Sure.

25
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,028
-Okay, please take me.
-It's a deal.

26
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,905
-We talked about it before.
-Yeah, that's right.

27
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,118
She might only be asking him out
'cause she's excited and a bit confused.

28
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,327
-About Arman?
-Yeah.

29
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,538
Why would you fall for Arman otherwise?

30
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,042
-And Handa left...
-Yes. Is everyone doing okay?

31
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:29,423
Also, do you remember what happened?
You cried the most when Handa left.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,635
The big incident.
That was shocking.

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,721
-That's right. You were bawling.
-She was.

34
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,431
I don't think I've ever...

35
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,349
-I've never seen you cry.
-...really cried on camera.

36
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,310
It's the first time I've seen you cry.

37
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:46,231
I vowed not to cry on TV,
but I was crying before I even realized.

38
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,651
-Hansan's really amazing.
-Yeah, the tears just kept coming.

39
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,194
He's amazing.

40
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,573
YUTO HANDA, 27 YEARS OLD

41
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,994
Don't make me cry, guys.

42
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,205
I have to leave now!

43
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,707
Sorry.

44
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,000
See you around, Hansan.

45
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,586
Okay, see you around!

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,506
That was so anti-climactic.

47
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,425
I refuse to accept it.

48
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,677
-You don't believe he's gone?
-Right.

49
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,096
You think he's gonna come back?

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,099
-Because I love him!
-Torichan!

51
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,060
That's a serious confession.

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,687
You haven't been yourself
since Hansan appeared.

53
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,858
The new person
just looked like Hansan to me.

54
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,401
<i>Oh yes, the new member.</i>

55
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,489
<i>It's the usual pattern.</i>
<i>We only saw his bottom half.</i>

56
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,449
He looked like him.

57
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,867
It's not Hansan.

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,371
-We don't know that yet!
-We do.

59
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,831
If it is, our staff members are idiots!

60
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,719
I can't see behind me.

61
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,808
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

62
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,685
Hi, I'm Yuuki Byrnes.

63
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,479
You're from the variety show
<i>Tensai TV kun.</i>

64
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,648
-Yes, that's right.
-Really?

65
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,024
I used to watch it!

66
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,985
Crazy!

67
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,654
You've grown up.

68
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,656
Wait, you know him?

69
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,034
Yeah, he's from <i>Tensai TV kun!</i>
I used to watch it all the time!

70
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,161
-You were really young then.
-Yes, I was.

71
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,498
I was on it from the fifth grade
up until the ninth grade.

72
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,544
-How old are you now?
-I turned 23.

73
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,629
Same as me!

74
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,840
-Please sit.
-Thank you.

75
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,469
A good-looking guy.

76
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,180
-You're half-Japanese?
-Yes.

77
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,350
-What's the other half?
-I'm also half-American.

78
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:51,106
I work at a burger shop in Nakameguro.

79
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,735
So you work part-time at a burger shop,
but also work in the industry?

80
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,821
-Yes, as a dancer.
-A dancer?

81
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,656
-A dancer?
-Yes, a dancer.

82
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,032
What kind?

83
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,368
-The style is called krumping.
-Krump?

84
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,496
-Oh, like the band Exile?
-Yes.

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,041
I also model once in a while,
when I feel like it.

86
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,879
When you say dancer,
do you mean backup dancing for pop stars?

87
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:19,384
Yes. The year before last,

88
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,430
I toured as a backup dancer
with Jin Akanishi.

89
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,932
Wow, you must be really good.

90
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,853
I was thinking of starting dance lessons.

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,690
-You mean your own?
-Yes, to teach lessons.

92
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,275
Can you speak English?

93
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,237
I can, but I've forgotten a lot of it.

94
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,823
What do you speak with your family?

95
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,909
I speak English with my dad.

96
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,496
-Japanese with your mom?
-Yes.

97
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,289
So you can speak English then.

98
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:55,587
But my parents live in Virginia now,
so I don't really speak to them too often.

99
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,424
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-I don't.

100
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,385
What type of girl do you like?

101
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,348
I tend to joke around a lot...

102
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,352
so someone who likes to laugh.

103
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
Someone cheerful?

104
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,774
-What about looks?
-Looks...

105
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:20,654
I prefer... taller girls.

106
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,281
How tall are you?

107
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,368
-I'm 5'11".
-You're tall.

108
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,746
Any preference in age?

109
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,416
Probably someone my age or older.

110
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,711
Not younger?

111
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,090
I've never dated anyone
younger than me before.

112
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,842
Maybe that's why.

113
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,637
-Should we take him up?
-Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,181
-I'll take your bags.
-Are you sure? Thanks.

115
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,437
This house is so huge.

116
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,233
That was a surprise.

117
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,693
And...

118
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,904
-he's the same age as you.
-Yeah, he is.

119
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,659
He has a pretty face.

120
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,454
-His vibe is very different from Hansan's.
-Right?

121
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,295
-Do you have work today?
-Yeah, at the burger place.

122
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,921
Until when?

123
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,258
Probably around 10:30 p.m.

124
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,136
Krumping... Like Chris Brown?

125
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,557
My dream is to be
a backup dancer for Chris Brown.

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,311
Even if it's just once.

127
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,062
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

128
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,481
What did you think of the girls?

129
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,025
I think Misaki...

130
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,780
is really pretty.

131
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,617
-Physically speaking, she's your type?
-Yeah, totally.

132
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,077
Well, I mean...

133
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:55,248
-She is energetic.
-Yeah, energetic.

134
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,668
I like that she initiates conversation.

135
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,148
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD,
ASPIRING FIREFIGHTER

HIP-HOP DANCER

140
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,997
MOMOKA MITSUNAGA, 21 YEARS OLD,
BALLERINA

141
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm sorry. I've already started drinking.

142
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,425
-I'm already having one too.
-Are you?

143
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,012
-You've worked hard.
-Thank you.

144
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,472
Cheers.

145
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,851
Oh right, they haven't met.

146
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,729
I just moved in earlier today.
I'm Yuuki Byrnes.

147
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,023
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

148
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,025
I'm Momoka Mitsunaga.

149
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,695
He came after you left.

150
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,615
The doorbell rang right after Hansan left.

151
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,243
-A few minutes after.
-Really?

152
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,996
-You're the ballerina, right?
-Yes, that's right.

153
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,331
-He's a dancer.
-Wait, what?

154
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,501
-I dance as well.
-Really? What kind?

155
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,795
I do hip-hop.

156
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,423
What style of hip-hop?

157
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,342
Krumping.

158
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,845
-You know it?
-It's my favorite.

159
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,138
I love watching it.

160
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,100
-It's very dynamic.
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

161
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,186
Come to my lessons.

162
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,398
-I do want to try it.
-Do you want to pas de deux?

163
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,775
-Pas de deux krumping?
-Is that like this?

164
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,070
Yeah! You know it.

165
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,531
We had a class in high school.

166
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,283
-Ballet?
-Yeah.

167
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,243
You seem suited to pas de deux.

168
00:08:55,326 --> 00:09:00,540
Yeah, the white tights
would look good on you.

169
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,502
I don't know if that's a compliment.

170
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,172
I just meant you're handsome.

171
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,633
Like a prince on a white horse.

172
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,512
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

173
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:18,266
Would you be able to come
to a dance showcase?

174
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,518
-I wanna go!
-We'd love to go.

175
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,480
-Showcase? What's that?
-Basically a show.

176
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,274
-Oh, a show. I want to go.
-Me too.

177
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,567
Please come.

178
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,361
-Seconds please!
-Okay.

179
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,072
That was quick.

180
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,866
The portion was too small for Misaki.

181
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,118
Who wants more?

182
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,995
I'll have some.

183
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,955
When do you come back, Misaki?

184
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,751
-The eighth...
-When are you leaving, tomorrow?

185
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,504
-In the morning.
-That's why your bag is out there.

186
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,050
-You're gonna start cooking now?
-Yeah.

187
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,762
Then maybe I'll go shower and change
in the meantime.

188
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,222
Sure.

189
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,315
Looks like it's ready.

190
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,277
-It smells so good.
-Bon appétit.

191
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,238
So good.

192
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,990
-It's so good!
-Delicious.

193
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,368
Riko and I made it together.

194
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,747
Riko oiled the pan.

195
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,707
She oiled the pan?

196
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,168
It's okay. It's edible.

197
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,381
-Thanks, Hayato.
-Thank you.

198
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,842
There are a lot of dishes to wash.

199
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,844
I'll do it tomorrow.

200
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,595
I'll do the dishes.

201
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,889
I'll do it since I ate a lot.

202
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,935
-How do you guys usually do it?
-There's a dishwasher.

203
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,355
-I think it's in use right now.
-I think it's done.

204
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,192
-Let's go hang out, Riko.
-I don't want to.

205
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,529
-You don't want to?
-Oh, it's done. So...

206
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,448
Never mind, it wasn't done.

207
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,576
This is definitely still running.

208
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,371
This is totally still running.
It's giving off too much steam.

209
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,082
Maybe the steam is good for your skin.

210
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,880
-There's a good amount of dishes to do.
-I know it's still running but...

211
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,134
You put the dishes in here.
You add the detergent here.

212
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,845
You sprinkle it here.

213
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,347
Do you have to do this
at the burger place?

214
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,851
-No, we hand-wash dishes there.
-Hand-wash?

215
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,563
Sounds like a lot of work.

216
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,649
-I'm used to it.
-Here you go.

217
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,944
Be careful.

218
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,740
-We're the same age, right?
-Yeah.

219
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,826
It's been a while
since I've talked to someone my own age.

220
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,705
-No way. Because they've all been older?
-Yeah.

221
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,042
-No one?
-Wait a second.

222
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,589
-Why'd you put this here?
-Does it not go there?

223
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,091
No, it goes down here.

224
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,178
-Here.
-It might take me awhile.

225
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,055
Glasses go here.

226
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,933
-The dishes go down here.
-Down here?

227
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,268
Got it.

228
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,355
-See that?
-Byrnes.

229
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,731
It's not Hansan.

230
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,483
-Torichan.
-Triendl.

231
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,027
-Yeah, it's not.
-No, it's not.

232
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,616
The moment Byrnes came out,
she looked down like this.

233
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,618
She refused to look at the screen.

234
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,079
I still can't accept it.

235
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,499
He seems lovely though.

236
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,125
A pretty boy.

237
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,129
-Mr. Handsome.
-Right? Very pretty and a dancer.

238
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,590
-He seems to be getting along with Misaki.
-Right?

239
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,342
But Rikopin...

240
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,095
Yeah, I was excited
by her first expression.

241
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,891
I want her to be interested in him,
but then she and Hayato acted all chummy.

242
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,059
So boring.

243
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,607
Weren't you excited
Riko might be attracted to the new guy?

244
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,152
I would like to see all three girls
interested in one person at least once.

245
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,237
Right?

246
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,532
Am I the only one
who felt she had that kind of expression?

247
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,494
-No, she did seem--
-She did, right?

248
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,747
-She did stare at him, but...
-Maybe not necessarily interested?

249
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,750
Momochan and Arman seem to be doing well.

250
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,754
What about the dance connection
between Momoka and the new guy?

251
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,673
They even brought up the pas de deux!

252
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,051
But we don't really know
what he's like yet.

253
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,388
-Yeah, we don't know his personality.
-That's true.

254
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,600
-We're only at the beginning.
-I'm sure he's a nice guy.

255
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,228
You seem to have had
a good impression of Byrnes.

256
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,647
It's not that I particularly like Byrnes.

257
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,568
I just like anyone
who can potentially create conflict.

258
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,069
-Oh, that's how it is.
-Yes.

259
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,156
I'll be on tour for three days in Sapporo!
-Misaki

260
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,165
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

261
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,168
-Thanks for washing the dishes.
-No problem.

262
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:00,006
-Do you have work today?
-Yeah, at the burger shop.

263
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,092
Yesterday...

264
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,262
You know how you and Misaki
were doing dishes?

265
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,766
-Yeah.
-What were you guys talking about?

266
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,684
About a bunch of things.

267
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,354
Is she easy to talk to?

268
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,066
It helps that we're the same age.

269
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,568
Yeah, she is easy to talk to.

270
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,533
But I was thinking...

271
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,704
I didn't get to hear
what kind of guy she likes.

272
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,377
What's the guy she fell for before like?

273
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,880
-Was there someone?
-There was.

274
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,050
There was? What was he like?

275
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,470
He was 19...

276
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,389
and a little intense...

277
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,891
-Intense?
-The way he spoke was strong.

278
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,021
-Not quite a thug, but...
-Not a thug, but kind of like that.

279
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,398
I see.

280
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,860
And she confessed...

281
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,240
-her feelings to him.
-She did?

282
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,077
So that didn't work out?

283
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:18,042
But she did say
that she's liked different types of guys.

284
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,504
-I see.
-I don't think she has a specific type.

285
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,091
I think there is a part of me...

286
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:30,346
that is attracted to her.

287
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,059
Have you asked her out to dinner?

288
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,396
-I haven't yet.
-Maybe a date or something.

289
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,775
I'll ask her when she gets back.

290
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,778
It might be better
not to go Yokohama with Misaki.

291
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,447
Why is that?

292
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,616
That's where she was rejected before.

293
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,537
I'm so glad you told me that!
Thank you.

294
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,960
SHIBUYA, TOKYO

295
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,756
Do you want to see
a picture of the 29-year-old?

296
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,883
Yeah!

297
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,217
Guess which one he is.

298
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,802
HASUMI FUTABA - AYAKA NISHIDA

299
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,512
-Wait, there's a macho guy!
-You like that?

300
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,597
I love that!

301
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,100
This guy on the very right.

302
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,603
He's on TV now, right?

303
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,898
-He is.
-Right? I think he's so hot!

304
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,566
-He's your type?
-Yeah.

305
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,571
But the guy you're talking about...
is in the middle.

306
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,032
-I think it's the guy on the left.
-No way!

307
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,201
-The one on the left?
-Yeah, with the towel.

308
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,203
-He looks young!
-I think he looks good.

309
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,871
Yeah, he looks good.

310
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,040
-Does he look 29?
-He looks young.

311
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,168
But can you see yourself
in a relationship with him?

312
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,712
-You know what I mean?
-Because he's 11 years older?

313
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,424
But I feel like we're always hanging out.

314
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,967
-Naturally you mean?
-Yeah.

315
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,763
And we got a new member yesterday.

316
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,727
-He's a 23-year-old guy.
-Nice.

317
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,104
-That's better.
-Yeah.

318
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,856
He's tall and half-Japanese.

319
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,777
-And I like tall, half-Japanese guys.
-So he's perfect then!

320
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,322
-Yeah.
-Oh, but there's the 29-year-old.

321
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,783
But he...

322
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,161
seems to be into one of the other girls.

323
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,913
Really?

324
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:24,168
And his type is
the complete opposite of me.

325
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:28,130
-He likes tall...
-Like, the slender types?

326
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,593
Girls the same age as him or older,
so he doesn't go for younger girls.

327
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,471
So someone tall
who isn't younger than him.

328
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,350
-That's totally not me.
-So he likes the womanly types?

329
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,310
I don't know about womanly, but...

330
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,064
So the girl he's interested in
is the same age as him,

331
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,401
and she's taller than I am.

332
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,864
-So she fits his criteria better.
-Yeah.

333
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,034
I can't help but think
there's no hope there.

334
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,955
So you're interested,
but you can't get close?

335
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,167
-Like, you can't come on too strong?
-No, I can't.

336
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,670
-What about the 29-year-old?
-I'll see how it goes.

337
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,465
The 29-year-old is interested?

338
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,093
He does ask me out on dates.

339
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,598
He's asked me out three times now,
but I don't know what he's thinking.

340
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,393
He hasn't talked about that kind of stuff?

341
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,270
No.

342
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,314
I wonder what he's thinking.

343
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,586
-Studying?
-Yeah.

344
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,633
-That's a lot of work.
-Yeah, I have to write a report.

345
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,094
I can't graduate if I don't do this.

346
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,638
-Really?
-Yeah.

347
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,557
What is all this? Social studies?

348
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,226
-World history.
-Oh, world history.

349
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,189
-Do you know anything about it?
-Not at all.

350
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,110
-What about English?
-I'm not taking English.

351
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,029
-You're not?
-No.

352
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,990
-Aw, I could've helped you with English.
-Yeah.

353
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,742
I took something else.

354
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,746
It's so hot.

355
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,706
-It is, isn't it?
-Totally hot.

356
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,377
-Right? I'm glad I wasn't the only one.
-Should I turn on the AC?

357
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,673
Where's the switch to turn it on?

358
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,176
-I don't know. I've never used it.
-Then let's open the window.

359
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,137
Thank you.

360
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,475
It might help a little.

361
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,560
-Oh, it feels cooler!
-No, really?

362
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,562
-I feel the breeze.
-Oh, yeah.

363
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,272
-It feels nice.
-Yeah.

364
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,442
-Now you can study better.
-Thanks.

365
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,947
Right.

366
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,537
-You're gonna study some more, right?
-Yeah.

367
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,915
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

368
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,126
-I'm gonna...
-You're gonna go drink?

369
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm gonna go have a drink.

370
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,671
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

371
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,098
-Studying?
-Yeah.

372
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,184
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

373
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,729
It's pretty cold today.

374
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,147
-It's hot!
-It was cold.

375
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,859
-I was hot, so Yuuki opened the window.
-You're all made up today.

376
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
-Looks cute. What's the occasion?
-What?

377
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,072
-You look cute.
-How can you say stuff like that?

378
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,991
What? You look pretty.

379
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,454
-Stop.
-Why do you have makeup on today?

380
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,956
I went out with my friends.

381
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,541
Did you guys have fun talking about me?

382
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,501
Did we?

383
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,547
Did they say anything about my age?

384
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,425
They asked to see your picture.

385
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,177
They said you don't look your age.

386
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,721
You mean I look young?
Did you show them a good picture?

387
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,348
Did you?

388
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,228
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

389
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,813
Welcome back.

390
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,486
-You studying?
-I am...

391
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,030
and not getting very far.

392
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,491
Of course you can't study here.

393
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,035
Arman, my friend thinks you're hot.

394
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,661
Have we met before?

395
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,332
-Oh, I mean...
-What? You should know.

396
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,793
I showed them a picture
and one of them said you're hot.

397
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,127
Seriously? Thanks.

398
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,670
Why don't you introduce us?

399
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,968
She's cute, fashionable,
super trendy and super tanned.

400
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,972
Apparently she's rooting for me.

401
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,810
When are you guys going out?

402
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,145
-This week.
-Oh, this week?

403
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,230
Where?

404
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,940
-Yokohama.
-Oh, Yokohama?

405
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,067
This time, Riko's really excited about it.

406
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,360
Right?

407
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,908
I am. I'm excited...

408
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,369
about the Cupnoodles Museum.

409
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,788
Look, Riko.

410
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,666
Hey, I thought
it was supposed to be sunny on Sunday!

411
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,753
-Oh, it might rain.
-I hope it'll be sunny in Yokohama

412
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,338
since we'll be there.

413
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,466
How about you make
a teru teru bozu good luck charm?

414
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,760
Why are you telling me what to do?

415
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,346
-I'm sure it'll help.
-Yeah.

416
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,850
It's a little scary looking.

417
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,811
-Make it cute.
-It looks demonic!

418
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,230
-Make it cute.
-It's scary!

419
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,148
That is a little scary.

420
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:43,862
-But what should we do if it isn't sunny?
-I'll laugh if this doesn't work.

421
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,115
Let's hope it'll be sunny.

422
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,950
If this doesn't work,
I don't know what will.

423
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,451
Yeah.

424
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,964
-How is it?
-It's freezing!

425
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,221
-Feels good though.
-Yeah.

426
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,890
Have you gotten used to living here?

427
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,851
Yeah, pretty used to it now.

428
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,020
When are you going on your date?

429
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:20,357
Me? Next Sunday.

430
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,569
-Next Sunday?
-Yeah.

431
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,321
You should go when Misaki gets back.

432
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:30,200
Yeah, I'm thinking of just grabbing
some food and drinks close by.

433
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,036
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

434
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,122
SHINJUKU, TOKYO

435
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,544
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

436
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,757
TSUKASA AOI
EBISU MUSCATS

437
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,760
-Sapporo was fun, wasn't it?
-Yeah, it was.

438
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,805
How are...
Are you having fun?

439
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,892
I worry about you.

440
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,101
-You do?
-Yeah.

441
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,812
You're like a mom sometimes, Tsukasa.

442
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,190
Do you like anyone right now?

443
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,400
-No one right now.
-No?

444
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,778
-You know how I was rejected before?
-Yeah.

445
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,738
But...

446
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,616
a new member did come in.

447
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,577
You like him?

448
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,246
-He's also half-Japanese.
-Again?

449
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,415
You really like them.

450
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,794
-Younger?
-No, the same age.

451
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,215
-It's been awhile.
-You need to stop with the younger guys.

452
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,842
-Just stop.
-The younger guys?

453
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:32,429
But there's another girl I live with,

454
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:37,601
her name's Riko,
and he's exactly her type.

455
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,021
He's pretty funny, he's nice

456
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,191
and he's tall, 5'11".

457
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,904
-You're gonna fight over him?
-Even so, I'm still interested in him.

458
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,906
You mean
you can put a stop to your feelings?

459
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,867
-You don't want to like the same guy?
-No, I'm not going to stop.

460
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,411
So you do like him.

461
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,831
I meant I'm not the type
to stop liking someone

462
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,750
just because a friend likes him too.

463
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,130
I mean, that's up to the guy.

464
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,383
So you'd fight over him.

465
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:14,054
I'd tell my friend, of course,
that I'm also interested in the guy.

466
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,516
-Of course I'd tell my friend.
-Wow.

467
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,602
But there's also a chef named Hayato...

468
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,525
who's been hanging out with Riko a lot.

469
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,112
They seem to be into each other.

470
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:34,992
So it'd work out if they got together.

471
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,702
-At least from your perspective.
-I guess.

472
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:41,540
-I don't want to have to ask him out.
-Why should you have to?

473
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,792
-I'm sure he's used to asking girls out.
-What?

474
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,878
He seems like
he's used to asking girls out, right?

475
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,380
-Probably.
-So you don't have to initiate.

476
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,886
The two of them and Byrnes...

477
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,096
Nice!

478
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,183
Usually it's the buns
that do the sandwiching.

479
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,934
Instead Byrnes's being sandwiched.

480
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,396
Unexpectedly! That's so true.

481
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,149
Things are flipped inside out.

482
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,028
This is the ideal situation.

483
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,823
That scene when she's studying?

484
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,284
You can tell she likes him.

485
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,955
Riko is still young,
so she's easy to read.

486
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,210
Like the way she stared at him
in the kitchen.

487
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,214
-This time she had stars in her eyes.
-Yes.

488
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,091
And then came Terashima.

489
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,471
Terashima...
He was pretty sure of himself.

490
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,684
Did you see how he demanded
she make the teru teru bozu doll?

491
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,394
Was he serious?

492
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,688
"Did you guys have fun talking about me?"

493
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,902
When he said,
"Riko is totally excited about the date."

494
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,989
She could agree, but Byrnes is behind her,

495
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,076
so she doesn't really want to.

496
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,746
-She kind of lets the comment pass.
-Yeah, she does.

497
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,292
Instead, she says she's looking forward to
going to the Cupnoodles Museum.

498
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,754
She rewords it to emphasize
she's looking forward to the museum.

499
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:11,964
I'm getting chills.

500
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,841
She was clearly conscious of Byrnes.

501
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:17,594
Yes, very aware.

502
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,848
Between Byrnes, Arman and Terashima,

503
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,350
you can see the difference
in the level of sensitivity.

504
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,814
One asks if she's going to study more
and leaves to give her space.

505
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,150
The two others keep asking
what her friends said about them.

506
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,237
It was really sad to watch.

507
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,031
I mean, as a mature adult.

508
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:42,411
-Terashima wasn't very smooth there.
-Yeah, not so much.

509
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,955
I guess it happens to the best of them.

510
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,875
Terashima's such a character.

511
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,588
What if the Cupnoodles Museum date
turns into a double date?

512
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,299
That's rough.

513
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,342
I want that to happen!

514
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,722
"Why don't the four of us go?
It'll be fun.

515
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,557
Right, Riko? Right?"

516
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,186
That'd be a stupid move.

517
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,232
-Are you guys off today?
-Yeah.

518
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,026
-You have work?
-I've got work.

519
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,905
-Tomorrow too.
-Hmm?

520
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,282
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

521
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,200
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

522
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,620
-Did you have fun in Hokkaido?
-I did.

523
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,706
It was super fun.
I brought back souvenirs.

524
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,876
What's with the teru teru bozu?

525
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:38,884
That was because
on the day of Riko and Hayato's date,

526
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,178
it's supposed to rain.

527
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,013
So you guys decided on a day?

528
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:48,518
It's not for sure, but this coming Sunday.

529
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,521
But it's the rainy season, so...

530
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,942
-That's so cute!
-Yeah, that's why...

531
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,027
-That's why you made it?
-Yeah.

532
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,488
You cut off a good amount of hair.

533
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,074
Not really. Just the sides.

534
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,037
-It wasn't that much.
-Sorry.

535
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,790
Why? Does it look funny?

536
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,834
Not at all. It looks refreshing.

537
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,756
-I hope it'll be sunny.
-Yeah.

538
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,801
-Where are you going?
-Yokohama.

539
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,469
Where I was rejected.

540
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,057
So Yokohama's taboo?

541
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,434
Not at all.

542
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,353
It just so happened.

543
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,314
Are you busy next week?

544
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:40,237
Next week, I'll probably be in Yokohama.

545
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,823
-For a live show.
-Oh, your tour.

546
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:47,828
But other than that,
I'm free between shows.

547
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,708
Let's go grab food when you're free.

548
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,544
Just the two of us?
Or with everyone?

549
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,297
It could be either.

550
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,923
Yeah, let's go.

551
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,222
What's with this vibe?

552
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,227
-What's going on?
-It's gone silent.

553
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,229
Did I say something weird?

554
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,231
Think about where you want to go.

555
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,608
Thanks.

556
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,487
Good.
