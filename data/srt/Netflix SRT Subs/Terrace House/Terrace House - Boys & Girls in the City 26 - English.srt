1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,097
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,767
<i>Terrace House</i> is a show about
six strangers, men and women,

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,435
6 STRANGERS, MEN AND WOMEN,
SHARE A HOUSE

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,146
living together, and we observe
how they interact with each other.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>All that we've prepared is</i>
<i>a beautiful home and automobile.</i>

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,443
-There is no script at all.
-Yes.

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,071
-Let's see, last week...
-That's right.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,782
-An unexpected man came in.
-Yes.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,785
-Yuto Handa
-Handa.

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,745
You sound like women in love.

11
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,247
Yuto Handa.

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,333
She's using her narrating voice.

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,837
I'm in the architecture department
at the Tokyo University of the Arts.

14
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,508
I'm studying architecture.
I'm 27, trying to become an architect.

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,759
YUTO HANDA, 27 YEARS OLD

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,470
-He's older!
-He's older!

17
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,764
-You seem happy.
-You're super happy.

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,099
Twenty-seven years old,

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,101
studying architecture
at the Tokyo University of the Arts,

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,187
and aiming for Harvard Graduate School.

21
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,691
Even his name, Yuto Handa...

22
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,277
If his last name had been more...

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,779
If it had been something really cool...

24
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,031
it may have been a little annoying.

25
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,575
But it's Handa.

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,830
The coolness of "Yuto"
is offset by "Handa."

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,166
-Yes, well-balanced.
-It keeps things in check.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,003
-Keeps it from being too much.
-It's kept in check.

29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,131
He seems invincible.

30
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,592
He's invincible, but there is one concern.

31
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,054
He has a girlfriend.
He came to <i>Terrace House</i> despite that.

32
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,140
Of course he has one.

33
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:43,854
And the way he was sawing the wood...
He's got a manly side to him as well.

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,273
That's what's nice about him.

35
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,483
What are you thinking about?

36
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,652
What are you thinking about over there?

37
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,029
When they were on the sofa,

38
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,990
he'd lightly throw in some teasing
into the conversation.

39
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,076
That was so nice.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,953
How long have you been together
with your girlfriend?

41
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,206
This is the second time you've asked,
but two and a half years.

42
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,419
He's so mature.

43
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,004
The way he answered that.

44
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,801
It seems that Natsumi may have a crush
on Mr. Handa.

45
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,970
It doesn't matter if he has a girlfriend.

46
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,138
NATSUMI SAITO, 26 YEARS OLD

47
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,931
If I fall for him, that is.

48
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,767
-Seriously?
-It doesn't matter at all.

49
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,853
It doesn't matter to her
whether or not he has a girlfriend.

50
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,188
She did say that.

51
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,399
We feel the same way over here.

52
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,526
Maybe we can have a new rule.

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,405
If we find someone we like,
we can crash the house.

54
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,324
The new crashing rule.
What do you think?

55
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,076
-I like it.
-I like it.

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,703
-Only once per person.
-I love it.

57
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,499
We keep talking about Handa,
but other things happened.

58
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,293
Oh, like Hikaru and Tamori...

59
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,838
-Right, Misaki.
-They have a motorcycle date.

60
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,715
It can be anywhere.
Far or close.

61
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,801
MISAKI TAMORI, 23 YEARS OLD
HIKARU OTA, 18 YEARS OLD

62
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,178
-It's easier when it's up to me.
-Really?

63
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,931
I can do whatever I want, right?

64
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,182
That's right.

65
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,601
What's going to happen this week?

66
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,645
Is it just going to be
Handa's one-man show?

67
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,147
Is there any part for Arman to play?

68
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,273
ARMAN BITARAF, 25 YEARS OLD

69
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,401
-Probably not.
-I wonder...

70
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,610
Maybe No-man.

71
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,779
Will Arman be Yes-man or No-man?

72
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,281
-No-man.
-No-man.

73
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,668
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

74
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,504
-No one's here today.
-Yeah.

75
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,924
Where's Nacchan?

76
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,594
She's... at an audition.

77
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,846
Oh, I see.

78
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,266
And Arisa's probably at work.

79
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,685
Yeah, I saw her this morning.

80
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,063
-What were you doing?
-I've been making problems.

81
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,523
-Problems?
-For the prep school.

82
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,818
Prep school?
You do that too?

83
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,112
I teach at a prep school.

84
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,780
-No way!
-Yeah.

85
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,907
-Did you eat already?
-I did.

86
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,035
-What did you eat?
-I had an egg sandwich.

87
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,956
-You're not hungry anymore?
-Maybe for lunch.

88
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,125
I ate this morning.

89
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,253
Do you want to grab a bite then?

90
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,213
Sure. Shall we?

91
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,840
Nice. What do you want to eat?

92
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,384
-A hamburger.
-A hamburger?

93
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,845
-Okay. Yeah.
-It's okay?

94
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,389
You know it's yakiniku night?

95
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,349
Should we not do yakiniku for dinner then?

96
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,103
That would upset Hikaru.

97
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:35,108
SHIBA, TOKYO

98
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,611
How are the guys?

99
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,906
The guys are easy to get along with.

100
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,741
-It's nice.
-You like them?

101
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,202
-Yeah.
-What about Arman?

102
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,954
Every time I have to do something,
he offers to help.

103
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,166
"Just let me know," he says.

104
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,876
-That sounds like him.
-He's always offering to help.

105
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,337
-And Hikaru?
-He's a rascal.

106
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,380
-A rascal?
-He's spirited.

107
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,258
He acts all mature in front of us, though.

108
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,344
Yeah, I can see that.

109
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,056
I thought he was just a kid at first.

110
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,934
Has Hikaru said anything about me?

111
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,853
Hikaru? Yeah.

112
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,188
He did?

113
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,482
He said he asked you on a date.

114
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,027
I kind of don't understand why.

115
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,947
So you don't mind the age difference?

116
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,449
I don't mind at all.

117
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,909
But...

118
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,994
But...

119
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,332
I'm probably not Hikaru's type.

120
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,252
-I wonder what type of girl Hikaru likes.
-Well...

121
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,963
he said someone mature and patient.

122
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,216
-I'm the complete opposite.
-Are you?

123
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,678
I'm not patient...

124
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,221
and I'm not mature.

125
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,640
I don't know, but...

126
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,268
-Didn't he say he liked Arisa?
-Yeah.

127
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,852
What happened with that?

128
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,481
I don't know.
I saw that on TV, too.

129
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,818
He said Arisa was cute.

130
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,488
And even now...

131
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:08,577
he still steals glances at Arisa.

132
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,663
It's bothering you.

133
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,082
Maybe he likes her.

134
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,294
So that's why...

135
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,879
I was wondering what he's thinking.

136
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,882
EBISU, TOKYO

137
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:27,887
YAKINIKU TORAJI

138
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,683
It's a welcome dinner for the two of you,
so order whatever you want.

139
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,143
Nice.

140
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,604
-I want liver.
-No.

141
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,355
You'll get some color back.

142
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,482
-I'll get my color back.
-You'll look healthier.

143
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,943
-Did you all come from home?
-Yeah.

144
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,486
-Hikaru too?
-Yeah, I did.

145
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,030
-Was it raining?
-No.

146
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,865
It was. Don't lie.

147
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,409
When I came, it wasn't raining.

148
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,827
Sorry.

149
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,582
-That sounded mean.
-Seriously?

150
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,752
-You were definitely mad just now.
-I wasn't!

151
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,005
Why do you guys think
I'm mad all the time?

152
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,799
They say guys are mean to girls they like.

153
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,552
-Really?
-That's in elementary school.

154
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,014
-That's only up to elementary school.
-That's true.

155
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,726
-Boys would make fun of girls they like.
-Yeah.

156
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,229
The two of you went out today, right?

157
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,190
Your girlfriend doesn't mind?

158
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,609
It's just lunch.
I'm sure it's fine.

159
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,572
-Does who you have lunch with matter?
-I don't think that matters.

160
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,865
More my...

161
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,285
my attitude and words.

162
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,414
How long have you been single, Tamosan?

163
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,791
About a year.

164
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,627
I do think about my ex from time to time.

165
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,464
And when I stop thinking about him,
he calls.

166
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,091
It's because it wasn't a clean break.

167
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,595
If you're going to break up,
you should break up.

168
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,348
Even if you start seeing someone else,

169
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:58,561
but if he's really meant for you,
I'm sure you'll get back together.

170
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,065
This middle ground, where you see him...

171
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,901
-You still see him?
-Only with other people.

172
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:09,322
You should tell him you're not over him
if you still like him.

173
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,450
But you can't help
keeping in touch sometimes.

174
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,162
-Yeah, even when I know I shouldn't.
-I totally understand.

175
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,456
-This is way too long.
-Yeah.

176
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,542
Bored?

177
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,044
I just felt like
the topic's gone on too long.

178
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,256
Do we even need to talk about this?

179
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,717
That makes me think you're immature.

180
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,725
-What?
-Nothing.

181

MISAKI TAMORI, 23 YEARS OLD,
ASPIRING ENTERTAINER, PART-TIMER

187
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,032
-What's wrong?
-What do you mean?

188
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,493
-What?
-You're frustrated.

189
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,870
I'm not.
What about?

190
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,914
About Misaki, right?

191
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,210
Wow, straight to the point.

192
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,505
When Misaki said you're immature...

193
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,673
-Yeah.
-How'd it make you feel?

194
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,011
All that talk about her ex...
was that even necessary?

195
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,972
-You mean after you asked her out?
-Yeah.

196
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,601
I felt like...
Whatever, I didn't like it.

197
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,938
So you're attracted to her?

198
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,106
Yeah.

199
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,984
I guess that's what it means.

200
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,321
-Your attitude is a little rough.
-Whose?

201
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,614
-Mine?
-Yeah.

202
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm the same as everyone else.

203
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,245
I was wondering
why the girls were picking on you.

204
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,830
-Did something happen?
-What do you mean?

205
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,999
They've been frequently asking you
if you're mad.

206
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,334
-Lately.
-Yeah.

207
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,336
Maybe it's the way I say it.

208
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,465
But when they keep asking if I'm mad
when I'm not, and I say I'm not,

209
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,093
then it seems like I really am.

210
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,847
Since you're roommates,
you should be nicer to them.

211
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,141
-We're living together, after all.
-Am I that cold?

212
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,767
-A little.
-I'm not mad...

213
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,105
Even to me, you seem a little cold.
Like you have an attitude.

214
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,071
Since we're living together,

215
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:59,033
I think it would be better
to not upset them.

216
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,996
Maybe this is strange for me to say...

217
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,124
but my sense of pride is probably strong.

218
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,587
I don't like being ridiculed.

219
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,716
I don't care if it's someone
I don't care about.

220
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,135
But when they are roommates...

221
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,053
I think that's part of it.

222
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:23,224
Nacchan and Misaki especially,
since I've been thinking about her...

223
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,978
When they say that,
I have a strong reaction.

224
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,898
He's immature.

225
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,903
-He was upset.
-It was uncalled for.

226
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:41,117
So when just the two of us go out,
what are we supposed to talk about?

227
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,249
And today, Hansan was so easy to talk to
when I had lunch with him.

228
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,584
That's right; you had lunch with him.

229
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,589
Especially after lunch with Hansan,
Hikaru's reaction from just a few words...

230
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:59,344
The difference between 18 and 27.

231
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,140
That little argument
about whether he's mad or not

232
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,351
did make me think he's young.

233
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,560
A little.

234
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,813
You liked him,
so what he said left a big impact?

235
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,945
I'm just surprised
it's bothering you so much.

236
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,573
It's easy for me to fall for someone
at first sight.

237
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,910
You mean from first impressions?

238
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,787
What do you like about Hikaru?

239
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,997
His face.

240
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,041
You're terrible!

241
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,668
You're kidding, right?

242
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,212
Seriously?

243
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,922
He's so hot!

244
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:47,642
I've never heard a girl blatantly say,
"I like his face."

245
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,062
-Arman is passable.
-Passable?

246
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,316
That's a little rude.
She liked him.

247
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,571
I like Arman's personality, of course!

248
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:05,952
If a guy had Hansan's personality
and Hikaru's face, he'd be perfect!

249
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,333
-So, Misaki likes Hikaru too.
-Yeah.

250
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,878
The two of them are attracted
to each other.

251
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,714
They match. They're just...

252
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,008
-I think so, too.
-Just clashing at the moment.

253
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:26,264
It's because he's attracted to Misaki
that he's sensitive to what she says.

254
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,476
Hansan's personality
and the face could be Hansan too, right?

255
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,729
-Yes!
-So, it's all Hansan then.

256
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,147
It's Hansan.

257
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,899
-Yes, Hansan.
-So it's Hansan.

258
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,402
Not just half, but the whole.

259
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,863
Does "Han" stand for half then?

260
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,157
-Yes, it should be the whole.
-Yes, the Whole Yuto.

261
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,121
Misaki would say,
if she got into an argument with Hikaru,

262
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,291
"If it were Hansan, he would have said--"

263
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,586
"Then why don't you go out with him?"

264
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,089
-Oh, so dramatic!
-Wouldn't you love to see that?

265
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,633
-It'd be so good.
-It'd be nice.

266
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,845
And then Hansan would say,
"Wait a sec, hold on."

267
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,139
-It'd be great.
-So cute.

268
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,308
It's like a stylish script.
It might happen.

269
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,893
It might.

270
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,063
It's a more modern take
on what happened with Seina.

271
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,230
SEINA SHIMABUKURO

272
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,483
It's more like <i>Orange Days...</i>

273
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,985
-That type--
-Nice.

274
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,653
That's true.

275
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,740
EBISU, TOKYO

276
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,663
MAISON COULEUR CATALOGUE SHOOT

277
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,000
I just added some color here.

278
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,504
If you want to add more,
we could use this color...

279
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,091
And by adding or not adding a highlight
around the eye,

280
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,011
-her expression can be changed.
-That's true.

281
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,013
Yes.

282
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,495
Morning.

283
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,539
-I took the day off.
-What?

284
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,457
-I took the day off.
-Let's go to the gym then.

285
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's go later.

286
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,712
-Where's Han?
-I think he went to work.

287
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,464
He said he had an early day today.

288
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,009
-Morning.
-Morning.

289
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,970
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

290
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,937
-Are you off today?
-I'm off today.

291
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,358
You're going to be home all day?

292
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,279
No, I'm thinking of going out
with Nacchan.

293
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,574
I think I'm gonna get coffee.

294
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,909
-Can you get me an iced latte?
-Sure.

295
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,828
-Arman, can I get--
-Do you want anything?

296
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,121
An iced latte, please.

297
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,040
I can't hold all of them.
I only have two hands.

298
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,876
Too bad.

299
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,463
-Oh, but you have to get it there.
-Yeah.

300
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,047
-Will you be able to hold it?
-I'll buy it if I can.

301
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,716
If you can, I'd appreciate it.

302
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,344
-It's fine. I already had one.
-Okay.

303
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,398
So I wanted to apologize about yesterday.

304
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,609
-Yeah.
-When we went out for yakiniku...

305
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,943
Yeah.

306
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,696
When you were talking,

307
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,533
I interrupted
and said the topic was pointless.

308
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,411
Sorry about that.

309
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,207
It was a little uncalled for.

310
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,171
I was wondering what would make you say
something like that.

311
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,381
I was just...

312
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,635
I don't know.

313
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,431
I'm attracted to you.

314
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,769
-That caught me off-guard!
-Yeah, and...

315
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,773
Hearing you say
you want to get back with your ex...

316
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,024
Well, not get back together...

317
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,318
That I think about him?

318
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,154
For me, that was a little...

319
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,074
Like, "What?"
I didn't like it.

320
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,578
I didn't want to hear it.
I realize that was immature of me.

321
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:23,501
But I didn't want to hear it
and tried to end the conversation.

322
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,336
-I see.
-Yeah.

323
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,463
For that...

324
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,508
I'm sorry. I apologize.

325
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,843
I understand.

326
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,680
-I'm glad to hear it.
-Yeah.

327
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,767
And you frequently ask if I'm mad.

328
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,687
I'm really not,
but maybe my tone is rough.

329
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,731
-Yeah.
-I'll work on that too.

330
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,900
I'll try to be gentler.

331
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,029
-That's right.
-To everyone else and Nacchan too.

332
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,033
Okay.

333
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,793
Hey.

334
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,754
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

335
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,632
-He apologized.
-What?

336
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,135
What'd he say?
Out of the blue?

337
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,306
I was about to ask him about it,
but he said it first.

338
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,269
-Like, "I've got something to say"?
-Yeah, like, "Sorry about yesterday."

339
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,689
And he said he's attracted to me.

340
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,988
-Really?
-He said he was attracted--

341
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,157
-What?
-He said he was attracted to me.

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,704
And because of that,
he was annoyed I was talking about my ex.

343
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,081
And...

344
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,419
that's why he said
the topic was pointless.

345
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,046
So that was it?

346
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,883
Yeah, so that's what happened.

347
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,305
For real?

348
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,516
Crazy!
You must be ecstatic.

349
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,185
It did make me happy.

350
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,064
Yesterday's concern is all forgotten.

351
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,068
You know, yesterday
I said I only liked his face.

352
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:18,991
But he really thought things over
and apologized.

353
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:23,746
Talking with him made me think
he's a good guy.

354
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,874
So quick!

355
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,463
-So you're going on a date with him?
-Yeah, I am.

356
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,218
-Of course.
-Of course I'm going.

357
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,762
Being in a couple.
That was quick.

358
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,891
We don't know what'll happen.
I don't know...

359
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,521
-And tomorrow is Hikaru's birthday, right?
-Yeah, the first.

360
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,939
You have to get a gift.

361
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,483
-Let's all get one together.
-What?

362
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,528
Hansan left a note.

363
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,655
"Tomorrow is Hikaru's birthday.
What should we do?

364
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,532
I'm going to pick up a gift
on my way home.

365
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,951
If you could prepare something,
that'd be great."

366
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,453
-I see.
-When did he come in?

367
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,996
-Isn't that scary?
-Yeah, scary.

368
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
I'm sure he took something.

369
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,585
You're so quick to suspect people.

370
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,963
-Shall we get something then?
-Yeah.

371
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,507
-Let's go look.
-Yeah.

372
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,112
Hansan, can I interrupt?

373
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,117
-Sure.
-Oh, are you doing homework?

374
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,787
-Homework? I guess it's homework.
-It's not homework?

375
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,624
It's for school.
My final project.

376
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,546
I met with the interior designers,
but I couldn't decide on anything.

377
00:20:55,629 --> 00:21:00,176
I wanted to make the display from scratch,
but I don't know if there's enough time.

378
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,428
-Let's make it.
-Is there enough time?

379
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:08,642
I designed a really efficient system.
It's strong, inexpensive and stylish.

380
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,438
-It's all those things?
-Yeah, and it's about 600 yen for one.

381
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,233
It's this big
and strong enough to hold a person.

382
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,777
About 600 yen for one.

383
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,362
-What's the material?
-Steel.

384
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:25,201
I think it's possible
because I've got a worker named Arman.

385
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,078
That's true.

386
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,373
Here, it's a little cut off, but...

387
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,044
Here, it's a net supporting concrete.

388
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,631
The bottom portion, not the top.

389
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,925
-It's like thick steel wire?
-Yes!

390
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,594
It's like a thick steel wire.
I'll draw it.

391
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,305
It's like a net.

392
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,307
I love nets.

393
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,186
You're free to paint it any color,
if you want color.

394
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:57,483
What I want to know is
what's the best angle to display a hat?

395
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,570
I want it to be seen from various angles.

396
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,573
Kind of like this.

397
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,408
This is a little low, but...

398
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,496
So a stack of these?

399
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,124
Or creating height with those nets.

400
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,919
I like how you could change the height.

401
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,673
If you decide on the placement,
I can make it.

402
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,134
I'll give you a visual, a 3D model.

403
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,262
Amazing.

404
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,847
-This is exciting.
-No way.

405
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,017
I'm so stressed about time.

406
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,896
The most interesting results
come from challenges.

407
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,481
-Do they?
-Definitely.

408
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,858
Don't worry.
It'll definitely succeed.

409
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,695
That's encouraging.

410
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,658
"The most interesting results
come from challenges."

411
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,078
-Wow!
-This is terrible!

412
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,289
Who wants to crash?

413
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,417
Anyone?

414
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,545
-This is...
-Damn it!

415
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,630
Amazing Professor Handa.

416
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:08,512
That line...

417
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,224
needs to be written and framed.

418
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm going to use it starting tomorrow.

419
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,649
Like, to my son, "Don't worry."

420
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,277
"It'll definitely turn out interesting."

421
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,490
The line could've easily been like,
"Don't worry. I'll take care of it."

422
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:33,245
But Professor Handa says it lightly
and even says it'll be fun for him.

423
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,373
-Yeah.
-Girls love that sort of thing.

424
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,084
And he was staring at his screen,

425
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,505
looking at his own work while explaining.

426
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:48,177
And he said very naturally,
"This'll definitely be fun."

427
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,387
He said it while looking at the screen.

428
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:54,266
If he was at all interested in Arisa,

429
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,354
I think he would have said it
while looking at her.

430
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:03,942
Someone with an ulterior motive
would've done that.

431
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,237
But he said it while working.

432
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,031
He's so hot.

433
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,868
That's true.
If he had said, "It'll definitely be fun,"

434
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,162
like that, it would've been shady.

435
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,122
But he was staring at his PC.

436
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,417
And Arisa was staring at him
staring at his PC.

437
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,254
-This was even more...
-That's exactly right.

438
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,423
-It was well done.
-He's so hot!

439
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,051
It's too late for Arisa.
She can't cut in.

440
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,177
Yeah!

441
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,683
But Arisa and Professor Handa,
they have the creator thing in common.

442
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,018
Too good to be true.

443
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,271
This is just to showcase
the greatness of Hansan.

444
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,149
-That's not true.
-No, it's not.

445
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,068
Are you forgetting about Arman today?

446
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,112
-Was he on?
-Yes, he was.

447
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,490
Hikaru's and Misaki's story
is about to start.

448
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,617
-It was cute.
-They were cute!

449
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,745
-They make a nice couple.
-They were cute!

450
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,540
Like during the meat incident,

451
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,794
Hikaru is young, but he's able to honestly
admit and apologize for his mistakes.

452
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,878
It's healthy!

453
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,089
-It really is.
-So healthy!

454
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,215
Organic.

455
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,591
-It really is.
-Yeah.

456
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,552
Is there such a thing
as being organically in love?

457
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,095
He's organic.

458
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,806
As you grow older,
additives get incorporated.

459
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,516
-That's right.
-I see.

460
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,893
We turn fluorescent.

461
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,563
Slowly.

462
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,857
-A color that can't be consumed.
-That's right.

463
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,568
We get used to the strange color.

464
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:32,573
-Is that what happens?
-That's what happens.

465
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,950
-Wait, you didn't hear?
-What?

466
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,160
What?

467
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,538
What? Did something happen?

468
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,540
-Nothing.
-What?

469
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,835
-She likes Hikaru.
-"Likes"?

470
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,629
-I didn't know.
-Not "likes"!

471
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,214
-You didn't know?
-I didn't.

472
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:54,678
Starting last night at around 11:55 p.m.,

473
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,014
she'd say,
"Oh, it's almost Hikaru's birthday!

474
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,268
Almost...

475
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,229
Oh, it's his birthday! Happy birthday!"
To herself.

476
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,733
How cute!

477
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,778
He's just going to play me and it'll end.

478
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,407
Why? He said he was attracted to you, too.

479
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,534
-They totally message each other.
-Oh, really?

480
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,203
With voice messages.

481
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,873
-They send each other voice messages.
-For real?

482
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,041
It's already started then.

483
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,876
-It started?
-It started.

484
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,879
-When are you going to get together?
-It hasn't started yet.

485
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,673
-Aren't you guys going out soon?
-Oh, yeah.

486
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,717
He didn't say when.

487
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,011
He's probably going
to make it official then.

488
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,972
That was so quick.
Hikaru and Misaki.

489
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,724
Well, I've been watching the show.

490
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,060
That's right.
You were interested in him to begin with.

491
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,478
Really?

492
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,064
Like, "Hikaru's so cute!" kind of thing?

493
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,441
I did think he was good looking.

494
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,194
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

495
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,113
That's so cute.
I'm back.

496
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,534
-Did Hansan do this?
-Makes you question his style, right?

497
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,788
How is it?

498
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,665
Wow.

499
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,209
-Amazing, right?
-Amazing.

500
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,629
-I thought of it.
-You thought of it?

501
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,590
Hikaru doesn't like whip cream, right?

502
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,133
-Or sweets.
-That's right.

503
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,218
Yeah.

504
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,637
Let's say "happy birthday"
when he arrives.

505
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,306
-Happy birthday.
-Are we okay here?

506
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,101
-This is exciting.
-When it opens.

507
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,435
Oh, I think he's home.

508
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,022
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

509
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,112
I'm so surprised.

510
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,697
Sit, sit!

511
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,740
-Cheers!
-Please sit.

512
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,243
Happy birthday!

513
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,453
Happy birthday!

514
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,293
-Bon appétit!
-Bon appétit.

515
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,295
Bon appétit.

516
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,257
Is this because I don't like sweets?

517
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,135
-It was Misaki's idea.
-Thanks.

518
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,220
Thanks, I was so hungry.

519
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,185
Delicious.

520
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,396
The sushi cake was a nice idea.

521
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:11,940
Thank you.

522
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,819
-Why are you laughing?
-It's nothing special.

523
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,738
-How cute!
-Don't play it down.

524
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,781
It's just to throw on...

525
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,576
Explain it to him, explain it to him.

526
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,163
-I went shopping with her.
-So it helps you relax, right?

527
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,956
-Supposedly.
-That thing works.

528
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,960
She was like, "What would Hikaru like?
It's his birthday. Happy birthday."

529
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,962
The entire time to herself.

530
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,173
I didn't say happy birthday.

531
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,342
-You were saying it the whole time!
-She was doing that?

532
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,428
-Thank you.
-I wrote details in the card.

533
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,722
I'll use it.

534
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,183
Should I read the card now or later?

535
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,312
Whenever.

536
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,648
-Nice.
-So I can read it now?

537
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,318
If it were me, I'd read it out loud.

538
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,613
Why? That's so embarrassing!

539
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,281
I'm just saying if it were me.

540
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,660
Happy birthday.

541
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,788
Why don't you read it to him?

542
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,415
-No way!
-Nice.

543
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,833
There are shows like that.

544
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,545
There are shows like that?

545
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,714
No, I'm going to turn red.

546
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,883
It's just normal stuff.

547
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,135
Wait. Hold on.

548
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,512
"Dear Hikaru,

549
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,264
Happy birthday.

550
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,349
-Happy birthday."
-This is really embarrassing.

551
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,892
"Yay!

552
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,064
Please use the roller
to roll away your daily stress.

553
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,067
I'm sorry for saying you're immature.

554
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,989
I'm really happy to have met you
and everyone at <i>Terrace House.</i>

555
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,449
I'm looking forward to my time here.
Happy birthday!

556
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,909
From Misaki."

557
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,244
Thank you.

558
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,623
Oh, man.

559
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,711
Thank you so much.
Seriously, thanks everyone.

560
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,379
-Happy birthday.
-I'll treasure it.

561
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,797
Happy birthday!
