1
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,433
{\an8}I'd like to propose something.

2
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,067
{\an8}Why so suddenly?

3
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,867
{\an8}-We're talking about our new outlook--
-Boss.

4
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,167
There's something I'd like to show you.

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,667
During the break...

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,300
I tried...

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,067
in my own way,
to make a new product.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please.

9
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,000
This is...

10
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,867
I don't know about this.

11
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,467
What do you think?

12
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,567
This...

13
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:51,800
is clothing.

14
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,833
For a summer break project,

15
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,667
it's well done.

16
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,667
But this...

17
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,567
is not lingerie.

18
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,167
This is also lingerie.

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,333
To me, at least.

20
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,167
You once said,

21
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:27,733
"You don't show your lingerie to others,
so it provides you with some freedom."

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,033
It's true.

23
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:34,233
It's not visible,
so there's no need to be shy or inhibited.

24
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,800
You can wear whatever you like.

25
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,067
That's right.

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,933
It's not visible, so it allows you
to express your true self, freely.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
If that's the case...

28
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:59,100
with Emotion's gorgeous
and feminine lingerie,

29
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,733
I can't express my true self.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,833
Shouldn't one be free to think that way?

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,100
I believe...

32
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:18,100
that Emotion's lingerie is
the most beautiful lingerie in the world.

33
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,433
No other shop
can make something of such fine quality.

34
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,533
The price is reasonable, too low even.

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,833
But...

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Emotion's lingerie...

37
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:52,000
is not the kind of lingerie
I truly want...

38
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,567
to wear.

39
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,233
Hold on...

40
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,500
I've realized...

41
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,567
when I wear the exquisite bras
you've made,

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,333
I...

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,333
don't quite feel like myself.

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,400
They're beautiful.

45
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,967
They're sexy.

46
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,500
But...

47
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,100
they're not me.

48
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,267
If someone saw me...

49
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,500
I'd feel embarrassed.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,333
I don't think you can call that freedom.

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,133
What feels natural to me,

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,167
what I'd want to wear
to feel like myself...

53
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,267
the kind of lingerie I want to make...

54
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,367
is this.

55
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,633
Will you allow me...

56
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,300
to make a product like this?

57
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,700
I see.

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,633
Lingerie that's too beautiful...

59
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,600
can be embarrassing.

60
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
It's true,

61
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,900
people have their own tastes
and preferences.

62
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,600
And you're free to want to wear
something like this.

63
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,133
But...

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,067
As a creator,

65
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:04,600
if this is what you say
you want to make,

66
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,567
then Emotion...

67
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,333
is not the right place for you.

68
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,533
We have really bad timing.

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,500
I didn't expect Mayu to do that.

70
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,800
The boss was tough on her.

71
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,100
She didn't have to go so far.

72
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,867
She wasn't trying to make her quit,

73
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,367
she just gave her a warning,

74
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,600
so that she understands
that kind of product

75
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,567
won't be accepted at Emotion.

76
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,267
I guess we should
put this on hold for now.

77
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,300
If we now express the desire
to create a shop for Em,

78
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,467
she probably won't listen to us.

79
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,200
You're right.

80
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,533
She did say she wanted
to go back to her roots.

81
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,933
We need to work out more of the details,

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,033
like finding a possible site for the shop.

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,567
Otherwise, she'll think
it's just a hasty expansion project.

84
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:29,433
But I think Ms. Nakatani
has an idea about that.

85
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,433
She just left.
She's going to speak with Mr. Miki.

86
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,833
I wonder what it's about.

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll let you know after we've talked more.

88
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,600
Don't leave us hanging.

89
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,533
Well, let's just leave it to her.

90
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,267
In the meantime...

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,733
{\an8}we have to proceed with this.

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,133
{\an8}Yes, that's right.

93
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,933
The boss told me to make
five series for Em,

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,933
so I'm going to focus on that.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All right.

96
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:00,233
I'll ask the boss about the show
and I'll work on it.

97
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,867
I guess you can't really help us anymore,
can you, Kaji?

98
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:03,933
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,533
Don't worry.
Just make sure you graduate.

100
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,100
Yes.

101
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:14,100
The work required for Emotion...
will Ms. Tokita be able to do it?

102
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,467
Mayu said she'll continue working
as before...

103
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,333
But I'm sure it came as a shock

104
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,133
to have what you made
be completely rejected.

105
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,533
I'm sure the boss feels the same way.

106
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,700
Welcome.

107
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,533
We've been expecting you, Ms. Nagai.

108
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,233
It's been a while.

109
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:08,367
You described the world of lingerie
as interesting.

110
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,567
-Yes.
-After that show...

111
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,967
I understood.

112
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,833
And so,

113
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,700
for the first time at <i>Conscious,</i>

114
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,600
we'd like to put together
a lingerie feature.

115
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,067
For a major fashion magazine in Japan,

116
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:32,867
doing a lingerie feature of this scale
is unprecedented.

117
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,833
It'll be a significant challenge.

118
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,000
And for that reason,

119
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,067
we'd like to write a very good article.

120
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,900
And for the lingerie to be featured
in such an article...

121
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,900
it has to be Emotion's.

122
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,233
APRIL ISSUE

123
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,000
THE CHARM OF WOMEN'S LINGERIE
AS EXPRESSED BY EMOTION

124
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,233
Will you collaborate with us?

125
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,333
To be clear,

126
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,067
I rarely ever do something like this.

127
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,433
I'm sure that's true.

128
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,367
I don't want the fashion magazine...

129
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,667
to be just a catalog.

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,533
Ms. Tokita.

131
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:33,533
You may take yourself off the trunk show.

132
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,633
What?

133
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,367
Wait. Mayu isn't rejecting your work.

134
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:44,300
That's right. She's working on the show
like you ordered.

135
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,967
{\an8}This is...

136
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,900
{\an8}It's a request from Ms. Nagai
of <i>Conscious.</i>

137
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,633
With their focus on Emotion,

138
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,967
they plan to put together
a lingerie feature.

139
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:05,600
Wow. That's groundbreaking!

140
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:09,700
I've never seen a magazine of this caliber
do a lingerie feature.

141
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:14,233
You are...
in charge of PR for Emotion too, right?

142
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,333
Yes.

143
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,300
As a representative of Emotion,

144
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:22,000
you'll help them put together
their feature article.

145
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:31,767
I'm sorry for insisting
that you not hold back with the boss.

146
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:36,733
I'm glad I was able
to communicate my feelings.

147
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:45,167
I think that the boss
gave me time to think.

148
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,167
I can take a step back

149
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,767
and look at Emotion from the outside,

150
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:58,000
and see it with a fresh perspective.

151
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:04,000
You really love the boss, don't you?

152
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,900
I told you, I don't like her!

153
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,867
<i>Emotion's lingerie...</i>

154
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:32,400
<i>is not the kind of lingerie</i>
<i>I truly want...</i>

155
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:33,933
<i>to wear.</i>

156
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,067
Here's the tomato.

157
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,233
Thank you.

158
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,133
THE CHARM OF WOMEN'S LINGERIE
AS EXPRESSED BY EMOTION

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,133
{\an8}We'd like to make
an impact in the industry.

160
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,700
{\an8}So we'll have a separate issue
just on Emotion,

161
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,400
including the cover.

162
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,967
We plan to fill it with enough information
for it to be a sort of book on lingerie,

163
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,167
which describes the different types
of garments, and how to wear them.

164
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,400
This will be an issue
that the readers will want to keep

165
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,833
and refer back to
when they're buying lingerie.

166
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,267
That's what we're aiming for.

167
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,433
Then we'll provide the samples
featured in the article.

168
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,667
May I have the schedule
for the photo shoot?

169
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,167
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

170
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,100
We'd also like to recount
the history of Emotion

171
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,367
as a separate article.

172
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,567
History?

173
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:33,300
We're working on it
with the writer Shuko Oyama.

174
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,500
We'd like for you to be our link
with President Nanjo,

175
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,800
and to oversee
the contents of the article.

176
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,500
Of course.

177
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,000
I guess that's it for today.

178
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,667
Excuse me...

179
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,933
May I ask you something?

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Go ahead.

181
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,267
Why did you suddenly...

182
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,567
decide to write a feature about Emotion?

183
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,333
We haven't paid the advertising fees.

184
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,233
And yet we get a cover?

185
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,667
It would normally be unthinkable

186
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,133
to feature a brand
that has no money or connections.

187
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,400
And in reality,

188
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:22,000
I believe financial power
is also a measure of a brand's strength.

189
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:23,567
Yes.

190
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,767
But if we were to only focus on that,

191
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,033
it would be the same old magazine,
no matter who runs it.

192
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,600
Out of the 12 monthly issues every year,

193
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,033
if I don't publish at least one issue
that includes something we believe in,

194
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,767
then I can't call myself an editor.

195
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,633
It would all be meaningless,
to have persevered through

196
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,467
hard work and competition
and risen to the top as editor-in-chief.

197
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,833
So you can create what you want

198
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,367
in only one issue out of the year?

199
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,867
That's right.

200
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,100
And when I was trying
to come up with an idea,

201
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,733
I saw your show.

202
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,900
And I felt...

203
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,200
that this was it.

204
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,033
Chief!

205
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,500
-Manager Matsumura wants to talk to you.
-I'll be right there.

206
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Excuse me.

207
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:22,633
This is Ms. Nagai.

208
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,100
Again, let the advertising department know

209
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,633
that what we're not getting
in advertising fees,

210
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,367
we'll make up for in sales.

211
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,500
In any case,
I refuse to let go of this plan.

212
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,400
The history of Emotion

213
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,700
is really the history
of women's lingerie in Japan.

214
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:58,833
These articles on Emotion,
did you write all of them?

215
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,133
That's right.

216
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,367
1981?

217
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,867
That's before we were born.

218
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,433
Can I take a look, too?

219
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,267
That's how long I've been working.

220
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,567
The both of us.

221
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,467
Take a look at this.

222
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:23,967
{\an8}The first store Mayumi Nanjo opened,
on the third floor of a tenant building.

223
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:28,767
{\an8}Emotion started as a really tiny shop.

224
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,767
LINGERIE'S JOURNEY THROUGH TOKYO

225
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,067
This is where it all started.

226
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Three years later,
from this tiny building,

227
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,600
she set up her shop on the street.

228
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,733
This shop?

229
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,800
-Not here.
-Hey, hold on...

230
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,900
Before this shop,
she had a shop in an amazing location,

231
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,100
closer to Chuo Dori Street.

232
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,767
The young Mayumi Nanjo
laid out all her products there.

233
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,000
It was a wonderful shop
with a vast array of products.

234
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,733
Laid out all her products?

235
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,467
-But that means...
-Shuko!

236
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,233
She used to mass-produce?

237
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,167
Welcome back!
I'll take those.

238
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,000
Emotion wasn't custom-made?

239
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,667
Not back then.

240
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,533
She wanted to succeed no matter what.

241
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,400
As opposed to now,

242
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,100
lingerie was considered inferior
to clothing.

243
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,200
It was considered as
something embarrassing.

244
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:29,533
So she hastily expanded,
and mass-produced.

245
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,167
They didn't sell, of course.

246
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:36,667
In less than a year,
the shop was forced to shut down.

247
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,833
She lost everything.

248
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,033
Her shop, her friends, her family.

249
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,267
I couldn't stand seeing her like that.

250
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,867
What? A decrease in female hormones?

251
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:23,833
It's very common in older women.
Well, in men as well.

252
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,933
It's a form of menopause.

253
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:34,500
Heberden's nodes are common
in people who overuse their fingers,

254
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,467
so your job may be part of the cause.

255
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:40,067
There is medication that can
alleviate the pain,

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,800
but it's best to just
not overuse your fingers.

257
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,500
Well... That's...

258
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,600
In many cases,
the pain disappears after a year or two.

259
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,567
So let's work with it.

260
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,367
I'm in shock.

261
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,633
Total shock.

262
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,433
As if you didn't know.

263
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
But it's terrible to have it put
so bluntly,

264
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,433
that it's because you're old.

265
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,167
That's true, but...

266
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,233
How are your fingers, by the way?

267
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
It doesn't hurt too much yet.

268
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,667
But it'll be a problem if it gets worse.

269
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,467
Whether it hurts or starts to curve,
I'll still work.

270
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,867
There's no way I'll slow down now.

271
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,667
What's that?

272
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:28,667
Mayu was influenced by this.

273
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,600
{\an8}FUNCTIONAL STRETCH FABRIC FREES FASHION

274
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,467
{\an8}It's the type of article
the fiber fanatic would jump on.

275
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,033
Maybe that was the real shock to you.

276
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,233
Why?

277
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,200
Because of what Mayu said--

278
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:44,800
Not at all!

279
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:48,033
I'm confident in what I make.

280
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,633
And elegance is
what's always desired in lingerie.

281
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,800
Yes it is.

282
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:59,033
For women, elegance found in silk,
lace and stitching,

283
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,067
is something they always want.

284
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,700
The Em samples for the trunk show
just came in.

285
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,100
Can you take a look?

286
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,733
Very nice.

287
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,200
Mizuki, you're on fire!

288
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,267
I wish I could show you.

289
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,667
What?

290
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:29,500
The inside of my closet drawer at home.

291
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,833
From one side to the other,

292
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,833
it's filled with lingerie that you made.

293
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,367
But...

294
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,500
I want more!

295
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
Thank you.

296
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,933
This is very well made.

297
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,367
Yes, it is...

298
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,467
-Look at this.
-Beautiful lace.

299
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,600
With a tailor?

300
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,033
Yes, Mr. Miki's friend is a tailor

301
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,567
who comes from generations
of tailors in Harajuku.

302
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,733
It's a nice shop.

303
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,533
HASHIGUCHI TAILORS

304
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
The street is a little hidden.

305
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:23,000
But that's actually better in Harajuku.

306
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,433
It would draw customer interest.

307
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,433
What are you talking about?

308
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,167
Mizuki, we might make it happen.

309
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,733
The Em shop.

310
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:37,400
{\an8}SHUMEISHA PUBLISHING

311
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:40,433
Our regular clients
are threatening to pull their ads

312
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,067
if we do a special issue
on a lingerie maker

313
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,567
who hasn't paid us anything.

314
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:45,933
You're putting a dent
in the long-standing trust

315
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,500
between the brands and our department!

316
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Please put a stop to the lingerie issue!

317
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,467
This brings back memories.

318
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,667
Mr. Takeuchi.

319
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:02,600
Huge advertising fees
of 10 or 20 million yen a month...

320
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,700
I remember having to bring those in, too,

321
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,800
bowing my head too many times to count.

322
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,867
But we did it

323
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,200
so that editors could create
high-quality content.

324
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,933
Having to constantly
kiss up to famous brands,

325
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,267
do you guys still
call yourselves publishers?

326
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:27,567
That's not how the advertising department
is supposed to be.

327
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,900
Stand between brands and editors,
and coordinate.

328
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,767
What do you think?

329
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,467
They're beautiful.

330
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,633
Sari Machida is good.

331
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,700
This shot is great.
It could be the cover.

332
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:06,767
Yes.

333
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,867
The others, too.

334
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,433
They're all beautiful.

335
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,933
What's wrong?

336
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:29,667
Seeing it like this,
Nanjo's work is truly amazing.

337
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,933
I'm sorry,
I know it's the company I work for.

338
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,167
It's nice to be able to say that
about the company you work for.

339
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Yes.

340
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:49,400
I suppose that what you want to make
and what you should really make

341
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:50,667
are two different things.

342
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,567
You and your staff

343
00:24:57,633 --> 00:25:01,033
don't necessarily write articles
the way you'd really want to.

344
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,833
That's true.

345
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,833
Everyone's the same way.

346
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,133
In that sense, I'm very lucky.

347
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,700
Even if it's different from my own ideas,

348
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,367
I get to be involved with products
I truly admire.

349
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,967
Is there something you want to make?

350
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,667
Have you made it?

351
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,633
I made...

352
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,900
what I feel is the best
I can make right now.

353
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,267
Will you show it to me?

354
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,967
So that's what's been going on
with you two.

355
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,833
I've left it up to her,
but nothing's happened since then.

356
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,967
Mayu's focused on her work,

357
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,467
and I'm graduating soon.

358
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,633
Why don't you talk about it in person?

359
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,367
Get an answer and settle the matter?

360
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:37,767
You only have a month left, right?

361
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,500
It's because I only have a month
that I want to treasure it.

362
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,600
The truth is,
if I can just keep working with her,

363
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,567
I'm fine with the way things are.

364
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:50,000
Facing challenges together,
joking around together...

365
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:53,267
But that's not going to happen, right?

366
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Nothing stays the same forever.

367
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,000
Neither people nor work.

368
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:07,100
Why can't we stay together?

369
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,467
I love her.

370
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,567
If you could stay together
just because you love her...

371
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:13,567
If things were that simple,

372
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,233
no one would ever suffer.

373
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,767
You have to leave,
even if you love her.

374
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,100
That happens sometimes.

375
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,367
So we'll go with this for the article.

376
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Okay.

377
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,400
The details, I'll leave to you.

378
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,333
Understood.

379
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,667
I went...

380
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,433
to the place you first opened your shop.

381
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,467
That building.

382
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm glad I had the opportunity
to work with <i>Conscious.</i>

383
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,000
I learned a lot.

384
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,667
Did you?

385
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,967
I'll go deliver the drafts, then.

386
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,867
We don't have time.

387
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:30,767
If the shop gets sold,
then we'll lose this opportunity!

388
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,500
It doesn't have to be now, does it?

389
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:36,867
-We can sell Em here for now and--
-You're talking too loud...

390
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,400
What's wrong?

391
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,000
Selling Em?

392
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,667
The location, the price,
everything's right.

393
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,933
It even comes with a talented tailor!

394
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,700
We won't get a chance like this again!

395
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:51,700
You've been saying until recently,
"Let's propose it to the boss."

396
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:52,767
So why?

397
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,533
Because I understand
how the boss feels.

398
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,200
The boss is in a slump right now.

399
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,200
It doesn't seem that way.

400
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,000
She's always so full of energy--

401
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,100
She hasn't been completing her designs.

402
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:18,200
For the trunk show in March,
the theme is elegance.

403
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:24,200
She decided that
she'd go back to her roots,

404
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,367
but she hasn't finished
any of her designs.

405
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,200
What's with everyone?
What's wrong?

406
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Wait.

407
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,133
What is that?

408
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,033
This is...

409
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,067
OPENING OF A NEW LINGERIE STUDIO
IN HARAJUKU

410
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:54,633
The three of us, Mizuki, Ms. Nakatani,
and I, were working on it.

411
00:29:55,133 --> 00:30:00,800
If Em has a bigger space,
where customers can browse more freely,

412
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,767
they'll be happier.

413
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,667
Maybe that's true.

414
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:29,167
{\an8}THE CHARM OF WOMEN'S LINGERIE
AS EXPRESSED BY EMOTION

415
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,400
Is this a good time?

416
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,400
What is it?

417
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,267
This was just delivered from <i>Conscious.</i>

418
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,067
It looks good.

419
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,567
Did you look inside already?

420
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,700
{\an8}THE CHARM OF WOMEN'S LINGERIE
AS EXPRESSED BY EMOTION

421
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,500
It's wonderful.

422
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,067
So artistic!

423
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,500
Yes, the pictures are great.

424
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:46,133
She really understood
Emotion's principles and taste.

425
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,967
We're not just hastily
trying to make something new.

426
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,333
Ouch!

427
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,400
Are you okay?

428
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,967
It just happens sometimes.

429
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:18,567
But it's really nothing.

430
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:46,067
NEW BLEND OF LINGERIE AND CLOTHING

431
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,600
I thought I declined.

432
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,167
I didn't say you could publish this!

433
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,000
I made a judgment call.

434
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,667
I apologize...

435
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:20,167
for not getting your permission.

436
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:21,267
Why did you do this?

437
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,167
I decided what direction
this special edition would take.

438
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,833
If we're doing a lingerie feature,

439
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,200
it's natural to want
to print beautiful things.

440
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:39,400
We were putting out a lingerie edition
for the first time,

441
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:42,933
so I needed to propose a new idea.

442
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,000
I'd been thinking about it for a while.

443
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:49,867
When I saw what you made,

444
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,200
I knew what it was.

445
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,967
With this, I can propose
a new idea to our readers.

446
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,900
Lingerie and clothing
should no longer be differentiated.

447
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:07,333
It's wrong... You're wrong.

448
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:11,333
Lingerie is not meant to be shown,

449
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,000
so it's different from clothes.

450
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,300
{\an8}This is not lingerie!

451
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,467
Is that what you really think?

452
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,133
I...

453
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,167
really thought this was great.

454
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:32,500
That's why I put it in.

455
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:37,900
I...

456
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,967
fell in love with what you made.

457
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:15,233
Sorry to interrupt.

458
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,400
What is it?

459
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,600
The boss just got a call
from Ms. Nagai at <i>Conscious.</i>

460
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,133
It's probably about the article.

461
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,533
I'm sure she'll understand.

462
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,033
You already know that about the boss.

463
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,333
And I think the boss
already understands you.

464
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,533
More than anyone.

465
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:52,033
Kaji...

466
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Thank you.

467
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,967
Excuse me.

468
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,800
I was representing the Emotion brand,

469
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,800
and yet I allowed a product
you rejected to go public.

470
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,833
I deeply apologize.

471
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,900
I heard from Ms. Nagai.

472
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:16,233
She said you didn't
give her permission to publish this.

473
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,633
<i>Conscious</i> had their own agenda.

474
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,367
And for their trump card,

475
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,900
they used what you made.

476
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:36,633
If that's the case,
it can't be helped.

477
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,600
It's already gone public.

478
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,267
But the other articles...

479
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,667
were wonderfully done.

480
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,133
They were beautiful.

481
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,200
Boss...

482
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,300
You're too generous.

483
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,900
You seem strict, but you're reasonable.

484
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,167
Your words are harsh,

485
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:16,167
but you always guide me
in the right direction.

486
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:20,900
What you make is top-notch.
You have technique and taste.

487
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,567
I really think you're an amazing person.

488
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,500
Why are you trying to kiss up to me?

489
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,300
I admire you.

490
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:47,367
I want to work here, under you.

491
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,067
But you can't make this.

492
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:59,900
Emotion must protect
its own principles and taste.

493
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,333
That's our responsibility
to our customers.

494
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,900
Of course.

495
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,000
There's something else you'd rather make,

496
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,867
but will you still be able to focus
all of your energy into Emotion?

497
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:16,200
It's my job.

498
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,300
Most people aren't able
to make what they want to make.

499
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,400
But they continue...

500
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,700
because they love their job.

501
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:40,633
I...

502
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,433
love my job at Emotion.

503
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,567
And so...

504
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:56,267
I won't ask you if I can make this.

505
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:04,733
It's okay.
I've gained confidence.

506
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,367
Confidence?

507
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:12,667
There was someone who liked
what I tried to make.

508
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,600
So maybe,

509
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:20,767
someday you might tell me it's beautiful.

510
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:22,833
This?

511
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,233
Never.

512
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,000
So...

513
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:37,800
You and I have a very different idea
of what beauty is,

514
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:40,433
but we'll continue to work together.

515
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,800
Yes.

516
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:50,867
Why don't you answer?

517
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,300
Hello? This is Ms. Tokita.

518
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,667
How should you answer?

519
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:19,167
No, you can't.
That's not Emotion's product.

520
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,067
Hello?

521
00:41:30,933 --> 00:41:32,500
Is this Ms. Nagai?

522
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:39,633
I see.

523
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:43,400
We're getting a number of requests,

524
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,100
both by phone and on our website.

525
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,300
They're saying, "I really want it.

526
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:53,033
Where can I get the product
featured on the last page?"

527
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:28,533
Your coffee's gotten cold.

528
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,933
How long have I been doing this?

529
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,167
Doesn't matter.

530
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,200
Everyone feels down at times.

531
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,400
In your case,

532
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:58,733
it's as often as an old couple
has Salisbury steak for dinner.

533
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,533
Are you trying to say
it doesn't happen often?

534
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,567
It's okay sometimes.

535
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:16,500
But, not for too long, okay?

536
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,133
Thanks to this,
we have an order from a new customer.

537
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,900
We need for you
to work hard again right away.

538
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,500
What did she say?

539
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:37,000
She saw the magazine
and decided to call, right?

540
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:40,300
That's right.
She said it was beautiful.

541
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:44,200
She says she wants it?

542
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,800
Of course.
What's wrong?

543
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:51,333
I heard there was a reader who said,

544
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,667
"Emotion's products are beautiful,

545
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,733
and I admire them as a woman.

546
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:00,833
They're like works of art.

547
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:05,033
But...

548
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,633
I wouldn't want to buy them."

549
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,567
What are you saying?

550
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:15,833
What I make
is not what people want to wear.

551
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,467
-They have become works of art.
-Don't say that.

552
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,967
"Back to my roots."

553
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,400
These days...

554
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:31,033
maybe my tastes are too old-fashioned.

555
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,133
What's wrong?

556
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,133
Growing old...

557
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:40,233
It's not just physical.

558
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,167
It's as if...

559
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:49,467
I'm being left behind.

560
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,900
I've had an inkling...

561
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,833
for a while now...

562
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:05,467
even before Mayu came to this shop.

563
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:11,567
Of what?

564
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,667
That...

565
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,200
maybe it's time...

566
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,733
for me to retire from this job.

567
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:41,133
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
