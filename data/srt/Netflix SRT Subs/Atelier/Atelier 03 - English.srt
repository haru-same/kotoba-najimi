1
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,433
After giving it some thought,

2
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,100
I think we'll try doing
a second line of undergarments.

3
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,767
We're discussing it
with Mr. Fujimura from Vanderbilt's.

4
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,367
That means mass production
to be sold in stores?

5
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:49,000
Prêt-à-porter.

6
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,967
I see you remember "prêt-à-porter".

7
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,167
Yes, I do.

8
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:57,500
But boss, won't this go against
our custom-made policy?

9
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:01,633
Our philosophy stays the same.
It doesn't change a thing.

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,333
Someone else will be
overseeing the second line.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,800
But that person must remain faithful
to the Emotion design.

12
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:09,867
Exactly.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,467
Which aspects of my design will be kept,
and which aspects excluded?

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,667
It must be selective,
yet harmonious.

15
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,867
But at an affordable price.
Which means?

16
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,633
Whoever is overseeing the second line

17
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,533
must be more skilled than I am.

18
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,867
What that means is,

19
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,600
while preserving the design qualities
and policies of Emotion,

20
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,767
we must develop a production plan
for a unit price under 10,000 yen.

21
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,233
-What? Me too?
-Of course.

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,633
-You do have good taste, Fumika.
-Taste.

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,067
Well, Mizuki and Fumika,

24
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,733
you'll be competing with each other.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,467
What?

26
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:03,067
One of you will become
the chief designer of the second line.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,067
Of course, it's also possible
you could both fail.

28
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,500
Mr. Saruhashi, you'll be studying closely
all practical aspects

29
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,167
of the line production process
with Mr. Fujimura.

30
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,367
-You too, Sosuke.
-Right.

31
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,767
If we can't find
a high quality sewing factory,

32
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,067
we won't be able to develop anything.

33
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,633
-This is essential.
-I'm against it.

34
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,400
I think our style is fine the way it is.

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,333
There's no point in repeating
the same mistake.

36
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,967
The same mistake?

37
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,133
Well, that isn't even an issue

38
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,067
until we can produce something

39
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,733
and establish a procedure
towards a manufacturing line.

40
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,633
But I want to try it.

41
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:13,600
Come on. You quickly get old
if you aren't competitive.

42
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,267
This is exciting.

43
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,800
The undergarment industry
will take on a new direction

44
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,233
if we can come up
with something different.

45
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,133
I've been thinking of doing
something like this for quite some time.

46
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,100
Hey.

47
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:45,033
Sorry. I--

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,500
You need to figure out
if you want to continue working here.

49
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,233
What?
Am I being fired?

50
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,867
No, you're not.

51
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm only saying you should decide
what to do with your life.

52
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:02,533
If you stay at Emotion, you won't be able
to develop your own ideas.

53
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,333
You're right, but--

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Or do you still wish
to continue working here?

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Think it over.

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,033
I will.

57
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,533
Taste? Policy? Sense?

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,367
I don't understand
any of this fancy stuff!

59
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:37,600
What's the point of having
all this frill here?

60
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,900
So, we'll be rivals for a while.

61
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,567
I hate being so serious.

62
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,467
I'm just here to make you look good.

63
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,333
Can you do something for me?

64
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Sure.

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,467
Ms. Tokita, I'm designating you
as our delivery person.

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,467
Really?

67
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,500
We've established a mail order system
for distant customers.

68
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,767
We do have customers from Nagoya.

69
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,933
Delivering our product to those customers

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,933
is of crucial importance.

71
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,933
I trust you because you're so punctual.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,167
Reiko.

73
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:45,200
Reiko, why did you start working
at Emotion?

74
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:47,167
What?
Where did that come from?

75
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, the boss told me I should decide

76
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,767
whether or not
I want to keep working here.

77
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,267
What is she talking about?
You just started.

78
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,633
I'm not sure if it's really for me.

79
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,200
I have no sense of style.

80
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:08,233
Do you think your job
is right for you, Reiko?

81
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,733
I just like the president.

82
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,800
I just want to work with her.
That's all.

83
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,400
I know you're busy,
but here's something important.

84
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,967
No! I completely forgot.

85
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,200
What is it?

86
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,633
Do you know this?

87
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,500
Yes.
That, at least, I know.

88
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,400
There will be a party for
the 30th anniversary of the first issue.

89
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:53,467
-Do I have to go?
-I'm going.

90
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,800
I love those things!

91
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:58,667
It's the only magazine featuring lingerie.

92
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:04,467
It's good for us
to regularly show gratitude.

93
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,267
Well, the president's going too.

94
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,300
Reiko, do you want to go?

95
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:13,700
Sorry, but I'm going
to the opera that night.

96
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,367
-Ms. Tokita.
-Yes?

97
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,100
Can you deliver this
to one of our customers?

98
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,167
Oh.

99
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,233
They asked us to deliver it.

100
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,333
I didn't know
your shop made them.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Thank you.

102
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,267
And your customer?

103
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,300
Doing final checks on a dress.

104
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,533
She wanted to see it with this bustier.

105
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
-Konno.
-Yes?

106
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,700
-Did the bustier arrive?
-I'll bring it now.

107
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,167
-I'll see you later.
-Best of luck.

108
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,900
Sorry.
It just came in.

109
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,000
How beautiful.

110
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,133
I think it would go well with this tiara.

111
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,633
This one is particularly elegant.
What do you think?

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,867
It's really beautiful.

113
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,333
Okay.

114
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,433
I'll need a sewing machine.

115
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:43,900
Wasn't there one here?

116
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,567
How old is this thing?

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,633
Made in 1978?

118
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,533
How ancient!

119
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,367
Okay.

120
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,600
It's done!

121
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,767
Thanks.
So sorry!

122
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,767
I bought it.

123
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,000
So, how does it feel?

124
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,467
Well.

125
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:53,800
Can I see?

126
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,967
Go ahead.

127
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,567
-It feels great on the skin. Really.
-No, no.

128
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,000
It looks like an outfit
the devil would wear.

129
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,033
I'm sorry for making you wear
something so weird.

130
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:17,367
You definitely look better without it.

131
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,233
Really?

132
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,867
That's shocking.

133
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,033
What is?

134
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,733
I thought it was a compliment.

135
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:35,033
People say that to me a lot,
that I look better without something on.

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,433
What does that mean?

137
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm really bad

138
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,233
at modeling clothes.

139
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,833
That's not true.
Even now, you look totally hip.

140
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,333
Something's missing.

141
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,167
I'm not at the level
of a professional model.

142
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,467
What do you mean?
That's so awful.

143
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,667
What's "style", anyway?

144
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:01,100
Why take such a vague word so seriously?

145
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,433
I don't think modeling is really for me.

146
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,467
But I can't stop.

147
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,300
It's my way of getting revenge.

148
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,533
What?

149
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,333
I'll get famous

150
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,567
and show everyone

151
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,933
they were wrong.

152
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:31,833
Sorry.
I got rejected at an audition today.

153
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:37,333
I'm really dark inside.

154
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:42,400
You have such an angelic look,
but you also carry darkness inside.

155
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,500
But,

156
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,867
I kind of like what's inside.

157
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:48,933
What?

158
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,567
It's total mud.

159
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,633
Well.

160
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,733
Maybe this actually suits you.

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Come on, I'm not that devilish.

162
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,033
What?

163
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,133
This week, I need to go to a factory
in Fukui to select some fabric.

164
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,067
Would it be all right
if I don't attend the party?

165
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,167
I wanted people to meet you,

166
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,733
since you'll be overseeing
the second line.

167
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,267
But first, we need to
actually produce something.

168
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:27,567
Well, all right, then.

169
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,633
Thank you.

170
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,600
However, I want the number of people
who are attending to remain the same.

171
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,033
You.
Come here.

172
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,200
Me? You mean...

173
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,633
Really?

174
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,333
Go fill your head with everything
that pertains to sense and style

175
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,333
until you can't take it anymore
so that you can understand

176
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,100
what the word "fancy" really means.

177
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:08,800
How did you know I was having
a hard time understanding fancy things?

178
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:13,200
But only if you wear
something appropriate and beautiful.

179
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:18,967
Think of it as a test
to see if you have what it takes

180
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
to do this job.

181
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,233
What?

182
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,533
I'm losing my mind.

183
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,067
That's fine!
It suits you.

184
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,633
Take that one.
You look cute.

185
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,833
If you really think so,
then I'll get it.

186
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,033
But...

187
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,367
I'll only be wearing it once,

188
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,533
so why should I pay so much?

189
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,333
Do you want to rent from my store?

190
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,267
We have a good rental selection.

191
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,833
No. I'll buy it.

192
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,133
This is a test

193
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,800
to see if I have what it takes
to work in this industry.

194
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,333
Excuse me.
I'll take this.

195
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Thank you very much.

196
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,067
I can make some adjustments
so that it fits you better.

197
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:14,533
It won't work
unless you take about 10 inches here.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
It's too loose.

199
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,233
Too loose?

200
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,667
What?
One week?

201
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,633
That will be too late.

202
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,967
Is there some way
I can have it done by Friday?

203
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,067
Let's see.

204
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,467
The soonest it could be ready is 6:00 p.m.
Would that be all right?

205
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,600
Yes. Thank you so much.
That's very helpful.

206
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,833
I made it in time.

207
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,167
The boss finally completed them.

208
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,233
Aren't they beautiful?

209
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Yes.

210
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,700
Please, have them delivered
by tomorrow evening.

211
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,800
-Confirm the orders.
-Right.

212
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,500
Casablanca to Nagoya.
Lily Magnolias to Tokyo.

213
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:02,767
Yes.

214
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,600
Ms. Nishida. Lily Magnolias.
Leaver lace.

215
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:13,800
Ms. Kondo. Casablanca.
Beige base.

216
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,700
Ms. Tokita,
you're a good wrapper.

217
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,967
Origami has always come in handy.

218
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm sending them off.
They'll be delivered tomorrow.

219
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,867
No, Miki.

220
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,633
Welcome.

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,133
Is it that time already?

222
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,067
Your model friend.

223
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,500
She must be suffering.

224
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:58,667
She has such an innocent look.
And she said it would be her revenge.

225
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,133
I was so surprised.

226
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,267
Well, anyone would be.

227
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,000
People always hide their true feelings.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,800
And if someone is always cheerful
both inside and out,

229
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,133
it's so boring.

230
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
Like Yuri?

231
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
I'm gonna hit you.

232
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
But what about that party?
I wish I was going too.

233
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,100
I'd wear a dress and very high heels.

234
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,167
That would be awesome.

235
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,733
Heels?

236
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
Shoes!

237
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't have shoes!

238
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,967
I just can't get used to
seeing you in those.

239
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,933
Is my walk that strange?

240
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry for laughing.

241
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,467
I just bought these this morning.

242
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:56,433
They told me I should wear them all day
and break them in.

243
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,800
Pardon me, but I'm off now.

244
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,900
At what time will you arrive in Fukui?

245
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,767
Past 2:00 p.m.

246
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,067
There's a meeting
at the factory at 3:00 p.m.

247
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,467
Take care.

248
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:13,533
Best of luck at today's party.
It will be worth it.

249
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,500
You'll get a good idea
what this industry is all about.

250
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,533
I'll study it closely.

251
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,333
Don't worry,
I bought some shoes.

252
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,400
-How cute. See you later.
-Okay.

253
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,967
We need to head out, too.

254
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:29,167
Of course.

255
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,000
Isn't the party at 7:00 p.m.?

256
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,733
I'm off to a meeting
at a reputable sewing factory.

257
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,033
They're making a sample for us.

258
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,667
Wait, that means I won't have enough time.

259
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:42,400
Hime, can you deliver
this manuscript to the editor?

260
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:45,400
Here's the proof of the interview
for printing by 5:00 p.m.

261
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,833
You can go home after that.

262
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
I'm leaving early.

263
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm going to get changed.

264
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,633
Be at the party for 7:00 p.m.
Don't be late.

265
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,833
Right.

266
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,500
Do you have a dress, Ms. Tokita?

267
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,600
It'll be ready at 6:00 p.m.

268
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,167
You're in a good mood.

269
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,000
Am I?

270
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,700
It's a genetic predisposition.

271
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,733
Genetic?

272
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,833
A woman instantly becomes happy
when she's wearing high heels.

273
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,767
-We're born that way.
-What?

274
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,167
These hurt so much.

275
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,167
Hello. Thank you for calling.
You have reached Emotion.

276
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,133
They received the wrong order?

277
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,767
It's the customer from Tokyo
we delivered to yesterday.

278
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,467
The customer from Tokyo

279
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,333
ordered the white Lily Magnolias pattern.

280
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,600
Leaver Lace.

281
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,133
White Lily Magnolias?

282
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:59,233
What?
Lily Magnolias are white?

283
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,767
I had mistaken the purple Casablanca
for Lily Magnolias!

284
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,167
I'm so sorry.
I thought I'd been extra careful.

285
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:14,767
My daughter's violin recital is tonight,
and I really wanted her to wear it.

286
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm very sorry.

287
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,867
It will be delivered to you,
guaranteed.

288
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,667
Yes.

289
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,533
DEPARTURE: NAGOYA 3:54 P.M.
ARRIVAL: TOKYO 5:33 P.M.

290
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,167
For Nagoya,
I can get there and back.

291
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:36,567
I'll go. It was me who didn't check.
You need to get to that party.

292
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:39,033
No, it's my mistake.
Please, let me go.

293
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,600
-But...
-You have the opera to go to.

294
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:46,100
Besides, if I can't do this properly,
I don't deserve this job.

295
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:50,067
I couldn't tell the difference between
a Casablanca and a Magnolia.

296
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,433
Okay.
I'll leave it to you.

297
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'll tell the president.

298
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,933
I'm so sorry.
I'm off.

299
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,200
No!

300
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,700
I'm so sorry.

301
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,800
I'll have it delivered to you by 6:00.

302
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,633
It's huge.

303
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm so sorry.
This is your item.

304
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,600
Thank you for being so courteous.

305
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:33,000
This one is beautiful too.
White Lily Magnolias.

306
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Thank you.

307
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:37,967
Pardon me.

308
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,367
You're leaving already?

309
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,233
Please,
stay for some tea.

310
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,100
Here you go.

311
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,400
Thank you.

312
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,133
That was wonderful.

313
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,900
Please, the next time you're in Tokyo,
visit us at Emotion.

314
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:20,833
I apologize for getting you so worried.

315
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm so glad you made it in time.

316
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,600
I apologize again.

317
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:30,800
I really wanted her to wear it today,
so I made sure to have it ready.

318
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm so glad I made that choice.

319
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,433
How beautiful.

320
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,533
I'll make it!

321
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,033
I've been waiting.
Your dress is ready.

322
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,200
-Thank you.
-Would you like to see it?

323
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:53,500
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.
I'll take it as is.

324
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,733
-I would like to show you what we've done.
-It's fine.

325
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,533
Pardon me. Thank you so much.

326
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,033
Hurry, hurry!

327
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,400
What?

328
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,167
Yes?

329
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,533
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

330
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,500
<i>I'm afraid I gave you the wrong dress.</i>

331
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,600
<i>I'll deliver the right one immediately.</i>

332
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
<i>Hello?</i>

333
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,700
It's all right.
I appreciate your concern.

334
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,300
It's all right.
You don't look weird.

335
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,400
You're even wearing proper shoes.

336
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:05,467
Well. Some people go to parties
dressed casually.

337
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,300
I was wrong!

338
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,533
I saw that on TV.

339
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,133
I'm so glad you came.

340
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,367
I knew you'd be here.

341
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,533
Come with me.

342
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,233
I want you to talk
to the new editor-in-chief.

343
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,033
Why me?

344
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,233
-Stop messing with me.
-No, really.

345
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,167
-She's dropping the articles on lingerie.
-What?

346
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,700
The tall one.

347
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:10,367
She says she's dropping
all features on lingerie.

348
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,700
How young is she?

349
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,733
She's 37.

350
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,333
Why is she dropping lingerie?

351
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:25,467
They said, "If you specialize in anything,
it should be in advertising."

352
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:30,167
So in other words,
increase revenue.

353
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,300
With an editor like that,

354
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,933
the magazine will become
a mail order catalog.

355
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,167
Rumor has it, Ms. Nagai,

356
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:44,033
that you're an expert in fashion
despite being so young.

357
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,500
I heard your latest edition
sold very well.

358
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,533
Well.
It fills me with pride

359
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,333
to have President Nanjo from Emotion
give me such praise.

360
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,933
It's an amazing feat to increase
circulation in the publishing industry.

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,467
It's all thanks to my dedicated readers.

362
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:05,800
This is my deputy editor, Mr. Takeuchi.

363
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't just stand there.

364
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,767
Pardon me.

365
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,233
-Pleased to meet you.
-Likewise.

366
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:19,933
Clothing is becoming a luxury item.

367
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,267
We need to focus on lingerie.

368
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,400
Is that a pitch?

369
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,567
Japanese women with refined taste

370
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:32,933
should know the pleasures
of selecting lingerie.

371
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,133
Especially those who like material things,
such as yourself, Ms. Nagai.

372
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,633
Sure, it may be a genuine form of luxury.

373
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,067
Mr. Takeuchi, it's been a while.

374
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,167
Emotion?

375
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,100
I've always been grateful
for the lingerie features.

376
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:56,533
-You're exaggerating.
-We usually don't get many opportunities.

377
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,200
Even Ms. Nanjo says that
this is a good opportunity.

378
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,700
-I guess your boss is a real woman.
-Who, Nanjo?

379
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,200
Well, I've got to go check
the guests' arrival.

380
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,333
I apologize for having disturbed you.

381
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:18,667
Hello?

382
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,733
What?
High heels?

383
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,933
What are you doing here?

384
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:37,067
I'm sorry.

385
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,133
Please, don't be shy.
Come in.

386
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,000
Well, I'm not...

387
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:46,733
My name is Mr. Takeuchi from <i>Conscious.</i>

388
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,500
{\an8}NORIHISA TAKEUCHI.
DEPUTY EDITOR.

389
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,067
Deputy editor.

390
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:54,267
We're so grateful.

391
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,633
I'm Ms. Tokita from Emotion.

392
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:05,500
Please, excuse me
for being dressed like this.

393
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,800
I'll be leaving very soon.

394
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,300
No, really.
Pardon me.

395
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:12,167
-It's fine.
-What?

396
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,900
What's wrong with what you're wearing?

397
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,733
There's nothing wrong.

398
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Please, come in.

399
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,667
Your outfit is adorable.

400
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:32,133
Thank you.

401
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm quite relieved.

402
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,067
Well.

403
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,267
Excuse me.

404
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,433
Excuse me, boss.
I'm late.

405
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm sorry for interrupting.

406
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,300
Is she from Emotion?

407
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:02,267
Yes.

408
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,767
She's new.

409
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,433
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Ms. Tokita.

410
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:16,267
Lingerie designers
have a lot of confidence.

411
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,433
Instead of decorating the exterior,
they focus on the inside.

412
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,433
What's important is to compete with what
you can't see. Just like with lingerie.

413
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,067
Don't you agree?

414
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,600
Isn't that why you can come in here
looking like that?

415
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,867
It's remarkable.

416
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,333
I can really understand
your policy now, Ms. Nanjo.

417
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:42,867
But then,
why did you wear that,

418
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:46,633
instead of wearing
your company's lingerie?

419
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:55,900
This is a meeting place for people
who make decisions about fashion.

420
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,133
Don't you think there's a limit
to how impolite one can be?

421
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,433
I'm so sorry.
It's not that...

422
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,133
No...
I'm sorry.

423
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,467
Please,

424
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:22,567
I apologize for disrupting

425
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,133
this formal gathering.

426
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,533
It reflects the deficiencies
in my training.

427
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,400
The next time we meet,

428
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,800
I will ensure that we're appropriately
dressed for your gathering.

429
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:40,867
Please, forgive us.

430
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:43,333
That would be very helpful.

431
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
We'll leave immediately.

432
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,733
However,

433
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,667
there is one misunderstanding
I must address.

434
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:02,267
Lingerie isn't something
that should be exposed on display.

435
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,233
Even if this woman

436
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,733
was wearing lingerie that was just as
elegant and beautiful

437
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,567
as what any one of you are wearing,

438
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:20,900
it would be absolutely forbidden
to show it here.

439
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,900
That's the charm of lingerie.

440
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,467
What the trends are,

441
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,100
or how you compare with others,

442
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,567
doesn't matter.

443
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,333
It's your own world.

444
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:47,200
There are no pretensions or lies.

445
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,400
It's a fascinating world.

446
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,300
Please, do feature lingerie
more in your magazine.

447
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,267
I look forward to it.

448
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,433
Now, please excuse us.

449
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,700
Sorry, our president can be like that.

450
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,233
I'm truly sorry.

451
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,700
Wait a minute.

452
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,800
What did you say to my girl?

453
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,100
Did something happen?

454
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,900
Just because you're fed up
with a younger female boss,

455
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,400
you think you can pick on a girl
who doesn't know better?

456
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:48,533
No, she did know better.

457
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,500
No matter how you put it,

458
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:57,300
she knew her clothing
was inappropriate for this event!

459
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
You ridiculed her.

460
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,567
Don't take your frustrations out on her.

461
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,967
I didn't ridicule her.

462
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:13,333
What?

463
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,500
Women are attractive

464
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,267
as they are.

465
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,800
Right.

466
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,467
Coming from a man,
that's the truth.

467
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
Let's go.

468
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:32,267
Let's go home.

469
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,000
My feet hurt.

470
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,100
I can't wear these anymore.

471
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:45,233
These things hurt,
no matter how beautiful they are.

472
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,533
It's too bad.

473
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,533
{\an8}Boss?

474
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,133
{\an8}Where are those heels you bought today?

475
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,133
{\an8}-I took them off.
-You idiot.

476
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
{\an8}Sorry.

477
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,667
{\an8}And your dress?
You got one, didn't you?

478
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:03,867
{\an8}I took the wrong one at the store.

479
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:06,000
{\an8}You're a complete idiot!

480
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,867
{\an8}-I'm sorry.
-Don't cry.

481
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,033
You understand now?

482
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:13,367
That's why you wear lingerie.

483
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,700
It seems pointless.

484
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,700
But you wear it for yourself.

485
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,100
Beauty is a weapon.

486
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:46,000
I guess we didn't make it.

487
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,733
I guess not.

488
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,633
The main bottleneck is stock.

489
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,967
We don't have much experience
with pattern grading,

490
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,433
as we haven't had to do it before.

491
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,633
If the cash balance goes down
while carrying an inventory,

492
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,433
our cash flow will start to suffer
right away.

493
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,467
There's too much risk
with mass production.

494
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:23,567
However,

495
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,533
this completely

496
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,433
encapsulates the Emotion design.

497
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:32,600
But with very affordable materials.

498
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,200
You found a good manufacturing factory,
right?

499
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,300
Of course.
And our retail outlets are already set up.

500
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:40,767
So it's decided.

501
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:45,433
Emotion will produce a second line.

502
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,467
The chief designer will be

503
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,567
Mizuki.

504
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,100
You deserve it.

505
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,100
Thank you very much.
I'll do my best.

506
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:01,433
It's very close.
It's almost there.

507
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,267
Its youthfulness is remarkable.

508
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,267
I'll study it further.

509
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,433
-That's all.
-Don't you have anything to say?

510
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:20,833
Beauty aside,
it doesn't have a shred of sensibility.

511
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,133
How can you just slap things
on together like that?

512
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,133
You completely lack any sense
of aesthetics and a feel for balance.

513
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:30,267
However,

514
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,900
you do have a flair
for choosing materials.

515
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,033
From now on,

516
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,533
Mizuki will be busy
with the actual design work,

517
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,433
so you'll be selecting the materials
and sourcing the pieces instead.

518
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,700
That is, if you still wish
to keep working here.

519
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:57,533
I'll do it. I'll keep going.
I'll never stop!

520
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,533
That means,
you'll need a new job title.

521
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,000
Welcome, Ms. Tokita?

522
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:08,033
Being in charge of materials
is a big responsibility.

523
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
I'm sure you'll do well.

524
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,767
Thank you very much.

525
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,800
You want to go out and celebrate?

526
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,600
I guess so.

527
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,400
-Huh?
-You bought such a wonderful dress.

528
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,933
It would be a shame for it to go to waste.

529
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,900
-Well.
-Don't worry, I won't say anything.

530
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:25,867
Just dress up nice,
and go out with a man.

531
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,767
That will say a lot about you.

532
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,067
No, no.

533
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,667
You don't want to be alone with me.

534
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:35,000
How about we take him along?

535
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:36,567
Huh?

536
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:40,000
No, it's not about
whether or not Sosuke is there.

537
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:41,800
Why?
It's okay if he's around, right?

538
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:45,567
What is it?

539
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,767
You completely lack basic female powers.

540
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,333
That's obvious.

541
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:55,733
What are you looking for?

542
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,300
Naturally, your interest

543
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,267
in clothes and makeup
should be emphasized.

544
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,967
Didn't you ever secretly wear
your mom's lipstick?

545
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,767
I didn't have a mother.

546
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:10,067
Well, don't worry about that.

547
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:14,667
I'm perfectly happy with having been
properly raised by my father.

548
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,167
Right, then.

549
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,000
You're the one using that machine, right?

550
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:29,100
I apologize for not asking.

551
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:31,567
It's the first sewing machine
I ever bought.

552
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,867
I guess it still works.

553
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,233
Yes.

554
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,200
I miss it.

555
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:53,267
I used to work with that thing
day and night.

556
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,433
I just didn't want to lose to clothes.

557
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:01,633
But then, I failed.

558
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,567
Actually, I regret it.

559
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,067
That's why I put that machine away.

560
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,233
We've been through so much.

561
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,133
Yes.

562
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,900
Is that what it means?

563
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,933
What is?

564
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,567
To make something that people can't see.

565
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:39,200
Like hidden thoughts,
or the desire to fight.

566
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,700
Here?

567
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:43,733
Pent up in here?

568
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,433
Come on, now.

569
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
It's just underwear.

570
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:55,967
Here.

571
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,467
Huh?

572
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:42,600
You're beautiful!

573
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,667
You look so different.

574
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,233
Wait, did you get taller?

575
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,700
She's transformed into a goddess.

576
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,433
The boys aren't quite up to par.

577
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,633
Be quiet,
this is a style too.

578
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,600
Shall we go?

579
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,267
See you.

580
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:09,333
I'll see you all later.

581
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:21,233
All right. Let's go.

582
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,400
Yes.

583
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,267
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
