1
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,000
Excuse me.

2
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,500
Were you inside just now?

3
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:22,467
How was the show?
Was it good?

4
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,133
Excuse me.

5
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,267
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
It was...

7
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,167
a beautiful show.

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Really?

9
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,367
Yes.

10
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,533
Thank you for coming today.

11
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,133
There will be a photo session,

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,633
and we'll be serving snacks
and refreshments in the lobby.

13
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,733
So please feel free to stay.

14
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,167
Did you enjoy the show?

15
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:10,967
Yes.

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,633
Congratulations on a successful show.

17
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Thank you.

18
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:34,133
We've decided to join in the numbers game.

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,600
A smart decision, I believe.

20
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,100
However,

21
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,267
we won't make 5,000 or 6,000.

22
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,833
I suppose Vanderbilt's would make
10,000 or more.

23
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,367
We won't inundate the market
simply because they sell,

24
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,700
and just turn them into
any ordinary product.

25
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,133
Otherwise...

26
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,567
we can't protect
the value of the Emotion brand.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Saruhashi!

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,833
Six Em products, with 200 orders each...

29
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,733
have just sold out!

30
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,033
Thank you.

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,100
But the total adds up to only 1,200.

32
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,600
That's a decent number.

33
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,900
That doesn't begin to compare with

34
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,933
Vanderbilt's Story line.

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Well...

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,433
I'm leaving now.

37
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,533
Say hello to Fumi.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,667
-Reiko!
-Yuri!

39
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,000
I was so nervous!

40
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,633
You did very well!

41
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,067
Thank you so much!

42
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,333
The show was wonderful!

43
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,400
All thanks to whom?

44
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,867
Mr. Miki!

45
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:01,000
Stop that, I'm all worn out!

46
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,100
Thank you so much.

47
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,900
It was a lot to ask of you.

48
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,867
Not at all.
I wanted to be a part of it.

49
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,700
I hope your agency won't be upset.

50
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,267
Your fees are probably sky-high.

51
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,133
Don't worry.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,067
I got this job six months ago.

53
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,267
Six months ago?

54
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:28,233
I think my fees back then...

55
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,100
could cover the cost of five hamburgers.

56
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,900
Will this fit?

57
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,633
Thank you...

58
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,067
for what you did today.

59
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:05,333
I heard that you brought in
Sari Machida from Narita.

60
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,367
You saved our necks.

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,533
It just happened to work out.

62
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,967
How many years has it been?

63
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,433
Who would've thought you'd have
your own coffee shop in Ginza?

64
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,567
Yeah.

65
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,900
Is that person...

66
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,033
doing well?

67
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,567
Probably.

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,233
You should've sent an invitation.

69
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
Voicemail.

70
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,067
This is Ms. Tokita.

71
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,800
The show's over.

72
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,900
How are you feeling, Kaji?

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,233
It's over now.

74
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:29,367
It's as if it was all a dream.

75
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,467
Yes.

76
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,233
It's so beautiful.

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Yes.

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,633
Today...

79
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,533
was all you.

80
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:50,967
What?

81
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,567
You were amazing.

82
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,367
Someone seems to have matured.

83
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,500
How annoying.

84
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,733
You were pretty amazing yourself, boss.

85
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,000
Me?

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,867
I just worked within my capabilities.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,333
It wasn't enough.

88
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:23,267
I'll do even better next time.

89
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,667
And put on a more amazing show.

90
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,300
Me too.

91
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,600
All I did was get help from everyone else.

92
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,533
I haven't made anything on my own.

93
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,667
Next time...

94
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,100
I'm going to make something...

95
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,033
with my own hands.

96
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,400
Well, let's clean up, shall we?

97
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm so hungry.

98
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,467
The Em section looks good!

99
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,867
{\an8}What do you think, Mizuki,
now that's it's all laid out?

100
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,133
It's terrific.

101
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,033
It's beautiful.

102
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,167
Thanks.

103
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,300
My designs on display at Emotion...

104
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,267
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,233
How embarrassing.

106
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,967
Where's Kaji, by the way?

107
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,367
I think he's still sick.

108
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,600
We haven't seen him since the show.

109
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,033
Is he making it to his classes?

110
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,533
I'll give him a call.

111
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:38,500
He's not picking up.

112
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,667
Maybe he's dead.

113
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,800
Don't say that.

114
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,567
<i>Hello?</i>

115
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,733
He picked up.

116
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,433
Kaji? Are you okay?

117
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,733
Help me, please.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,167
For real?

119
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,200
You asked for help!

120
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,167
For real?

121
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,933
Don't mind me.

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,133
Stay in bed.

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,967
But I...

124
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
Do you mind if I clean up?

125
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,467
TECHNICAL TERMS OF FABRICS

126
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,967
Wow.

127
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,333
Yeah, it was amazing.

128
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,200
I wish I'd been there.

129
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:29,000
Next time.

130
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,733
The boss seems eager

131
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,833
to do these regularly.

132
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Next time.

133
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,500
Are you feeling better?

134
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,233
Yes!

135
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
That's good.

136
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:45,300
Everyone was worried.

137
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,767
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,767
Are you okay?
Can you get up?

139
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,833
Yes.

140
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,933
Thank you again.

141
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,067
No worries. Here.

142
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,767
This is amazing, though.

143
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,300
I was surprised.

144
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,033
It's my senior year project.

145
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,133
I see.

146
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:14,200
It's called Chusen.
A dyeing technique.

147
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,600
Chusen?

148
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,233
My family runs a workshop
back in Takasaki.

149
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,233
It's old and very tiny.

150
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,900
They dye fabrics for yukata kimonos
and tenugui hand towels.

151
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,833
Like these?

152
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,767
Yes, like those.

153
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,833
So you're going to take over the business.

154
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,133
Well, yes.

155
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
I see.

156
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:53,000
It's beautiful.

157
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:57,767
But these are just for my project.
For fun, really.

158
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:02,267
It's nothing compared to my dad's work.

159
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,933
My dad's like that too.

160
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,267
What?

161
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,267
He used to run a factory
that made silk out of cocoons.

162
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,667
Really?

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
That's why your name is Mayuko?

164
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,400
But the factory closed down.

165
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,900
A long time ago.

166
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,533
I really loved it...

167
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,567
watching the threads being made.

168
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:43,133
I wonder why the things you see as a child
seem so beautiful.

169
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,433
What?

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,767
You're beautiful.

171
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,833
Really.

172
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,633
Ouch.

173
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,133
Aren't you overreacting?

175
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,367
It's because...

176
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,767
It's because you suddenly...

177
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,500
I was caught off guard!

178
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,833
What was that?

179
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,833
You came over to my place!
Should I not have any expectations?

180
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:27,267
-Expectations?
-Expectations.

181
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,367
On my part, at least.

182
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,133
Sorry.

183
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,367
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,967
Do you really dislike me?

185
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,000
I mean, never mind.

186
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,100
Of course you do.

187
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,500
I know you don't see me that way.

188
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,233
That's why you came over.

189
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,833
This isn't about
whether or not I like you!

190
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,833
That's exactly what it's about.

191
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,267
Okay, maybe.

192
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,300
Which way are you leaning?

193
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,200
Toward liking or not liking me?

194
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,633
That's... That's really unfair!

195
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,067
I know.

196
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,767
I know I'm grasping at straws here, but...

197
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,600
I want to touch you because I like you.

198
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,167
Is that bad?

199
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,833
It is!

200
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,067
-Of course.
-No!

201
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,933
No, I mean...

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,367
Let me explain.

203
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,533
I have a very personal reason

204
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,567
for not being able
to answer you right now.

205
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:46,167
Because... Well, because...

206
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,933
I can't help but imagine
what it all leads to.

207
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,033
And I definitely can't take my clothes off
right now!

208
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,900
I wasn't planning on going that far.

209
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,867
Well, even if we did go that far,

210
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:05,267
you don't have to worry.

211
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm not proud of it,

212
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,400
but I'm wearing very old underwear.

213
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,967
What? No!

214
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,633
Today, I'm wearing Emotion's
very glamorous, lacy, sexy bra.

215
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,967
The kind President Nanjo likes.

216
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,433
And it's purple.

217
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,000
So, definitely not!

218
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,767
So it's really pretty then.

219
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,133
All the more reason--

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,767
Definitely not!

221
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,867
That's not it!

222
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,100
This...

223
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:43,400
No. I can't let anyone see it!
I just can't.

224
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,633
So, goodbye.

225
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,833
Wait, wait!

226
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,000
What does that mean?

227
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,867
Welcome.

228
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,967
This is Emotion and this side is Em.

229
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:30,600
Has anyone here come for
Emotion's custom-made products?

230
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,133
Please fill out this card,
if you don't mind.

231
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:39,333
This is a bigger crowd than we expected.

232
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm happy the show did so well.

233
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:45,033
We don't want to disrupt the flow.

234
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,967
I'll order another production of
Em garments right away.

235
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,967
We've ordered the materials
already, right?

236
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,733
Yes! The plastic from AGN
is coming in tomorrow.

237
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
And the rest is already at the factory.

238
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,167
Thanks.

239
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,800
He's got a lot of energy.

240
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,433
-Did something happen?
-Perhaps.

241
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,933
Can I put these ones out?

242
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,933
Boss, Ms. Suzuki is here
for your 2:00 p.m. appointment.

243
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:11,000
No worries!
These are the new Em products.

245
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,233
Well...

246
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,133
You... You can leave them there.

247
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,767
Whenever you're ready, boss.

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,700
Well, show me the additional Em products
once they're finished.

249
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,233
Yes, we'll make them quickly.

250
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,033
We should leave him alone.

251
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,133
Are you ready?

252
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,500
Hurry up and show us.

253
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,033
Here we go.

254
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,633
This one.
And this one.

255
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,867
This one.
This.

256
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,033
And these too.

257
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
And this!

258
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,067
Wow, really?

259
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,500
All of them have articles on Emotion!

260
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,200
Let's see!

261
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,167
{\an8}Wow!

262
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,467
Here!

263
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,967
It's a big feature.

264
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,300
-What about that one?
-This one too.

265
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,533
I wish I was at the show too!

266
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,067
Here you go, boss.

267
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,967
<i>Conscious?</i>

268
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,967
That old hag wrote the article, right?

269
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,600
Mrs. Oyama, you mean.

270
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,167
But...

271
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,533
EMOTION
THE NEW WORLD OF LINGERIE

272
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Wow.

273
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,900
Our logo's on the cover.

274
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,500
Where?

275
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,467
Wow!

276
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,733
Did we pay for this?

277
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:55,933
No.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,433
It must be Ms. Nagai.

279
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,267
It's gratifying.

280
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Yes.

281
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,967
FUMI

282
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,033
EMOTION'S RUNWAY SHOW
THE NEW WORLD OF LINGERIE

283
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,567
To a job well done.

284
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,433
It's amazing.

285
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,133
It's everywhere.

286
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,233
It really means something

287
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,533
when a fashion magazine
runs an article on lingerie.

288
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
It's a big success.

289
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,533
I can't thank you enough, Yuri.

290
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,300
Stop it!

291
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,467
And Mr. Miki.

292
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,700
Yeah, he's not here.

293
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,700
Thank you.

294
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,467
He's in the Maldives by now.

295
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,967
I guess they made up.

296
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,967
Him and his boyfriend, or whatever.

297
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Thank you too, Mr. Yamazaki.

298
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,367
Did you meet our boss?

299
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Yes.

300
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,833
She greeted me very politely.

301
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,200
Really? Isn't she something?

302
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,733
Well, yeah...

303
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:19,633
I wonder why there aren't many articles
on lingerie.

304
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,500
Because it's too sexy?

305
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,000
There's too much nudity?

306
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,133
It's not something
you normally show people.

307
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,867
It's only for special occasions, right?

308
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,333
I finally understand.

309
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,700
What?

310
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,767
What lingerie means to women.

311
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,467
You're getting philosophical again.

312
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,100
I never really thought about it.

313
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,100
I thought that as long as it's pretty
and well-made, it was good enough.

314
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,700
But I was wrong.

315
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:53,933
Lingerie has to be
a reflection of yourself.

316
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,567
More than your clothes, bags, or shoes.

317
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,433
A reflection of yourself?

318
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,733
It's fine as long as it's cute.

319
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,300
No.

320
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,600
Cute lingerie works for you.

321
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,800
Because of your personality.

322
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,000
That's why.

323
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,600
Welcome.

324
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Hello.

325
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,167
So you're Kaji?

326
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,133
Have you heard about me?

327
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
No, not at all.

328
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm sorry for interrupting.

329
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:34,100
But I wanted to talk to Mayu.

330
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:36,533
Yes, of course.
I'll just be over there.

331
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,500
Please stay, it'll be quick.

332
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Okay.

333
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:48,600
Things have become awkward
since that time.

334
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,033
-Yes, since that time.
-Cut it out.

335
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,367
Do we have to talk about this here?

336
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:59,733
I'm going back to Takasaki next spring.

337
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,267
So I'm not sure why I'm trying so hard
to get you,

338
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,200
when it won't amount to anything.

339
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:12,933
I know you're planning on
staying in Tokyo.

340
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,567
But you're obsessed with
fiber and threads,

341
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:21,733
so I know you'll understand my work.

342
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,767
Your work?

343
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,933
Here.

344
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,333
Did you dye this?

345
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:37,967
My dad did.

346
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,167
I want to be able to do this someday.

347
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,567
And I want to make something
only I can make.

348
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,467
Not just traditional patterns,

349
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,867
something more modern and polished.

350
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,900
Not only yukata kimonos
and tenugui hand towels.

351
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,933
I guess I'm not being very clear.

352
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,033
That's not true.

353
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,467
I want to show...

354
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,700
something I make.

355
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,433
Something only I can make.

356
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:17,967
To you.

357
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,267
I'm sorry, I know I'm being self-centered.

358
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,700
But you don't have to
think about it too much.

359
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:34,467
Well, I guess you do,
now that I've talked about it.

360
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,333
But yeah...

361
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,933
that's it.

362
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Goodbye.

363
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,233
I'm sorry I didn't order anything.

364
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,400
-Please come again.
-Yes, thank you.

365
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,100
Excuse me.

366
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,500
He really likes you!

367
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,533
What are you gonna do?

368
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,133
I don't know.

369
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But...

370
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:31,200
Do you realize it's already December?

371
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:33,167
What? Really?

372
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,933
Mizuki, do either of you ever go home?

373
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Don't worry.
My daughter brings me clean clothes.

374
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,533
I don't know about him, though.

375
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,800
We're a little too busy.

376
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,133
Here are the materials
for the new client's order.

377
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,900
Is it already ready?

378
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,833
All the laces and fabrics you like,

379
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,200
it's all in here.

380
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,667
You don't even know how to sew!

381
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:44,100
Starting today,
I'll be the newest member of Emotion.

382
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,533
I'm Rin Nakatani.

383
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,400
Ms. Nakatani?

384
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:54,000
Mizuki and Reiko
have reached their limits, right?

385
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,233
So I've decided to have her help us.

386
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,467
But...

387
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,100
I'm the one who asked President Nanjo.

388
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
I've been thinking about it for a while.

389
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:08,000
I'd like to do more of the creative work.

390
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:14,067
After the runway show,
I couldn't wait any longer.

391
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,500
It was really good timing.

392
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,733
I studied fashion in school.

393
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,967
I can sew and create patterns.

394
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,400
That would be very helpful!

395
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,800
It's very different from having
some fiber fetish.

396
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,267
-What?
-It's so helpful.

397
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,933
Good morning.
It's so cold!

398
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,867
You let your hair down.

399
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,267
Good morning, senior co-worker.

400
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,400
Senior co-worker?

401
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,500
What?

402
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,900
I have a general grasp of things now.

403
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,400
Thank you very much.

404
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,500
You changed your hairstyle.

405
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
I felt like I needed a change.

406
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,033
It's nice.

407
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,767
That was a gutsy move, Ms. Nakatani.

408
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,133
Not really.

409
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,033
I've thought about it for years.

410
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,733
I see.

411
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:17,467
But...

412
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:20,833
that show made me want to take the plunge.

413
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,900
I'm in love with Emotion's lingerie.

414
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,133
I get excited choosing...

415
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,167
which to wear every morning.

416
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,133
I'd love to make exactly
what I'd want to wear...

417
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,867
with my own hands,

418
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:42,367
and have customers wear it.

419
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,467
I mean,
what a wonderful job that would be.

420
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,300
Yes, it would.

421
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to preach.

422
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,900
No, I understand completely.

423
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,567
I also love Emotion's products.

424
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:05,933
I really love them!

425
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
But...

426
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,233
But?

427
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:20,600
Boss.

428
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,967
Boss!

429
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:25,100
It's the end of the year.
We have to close the books.

430
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,233
Otherwise, the banks will get--

431
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,933
I know, I know.

432
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,467
I'll go with you to the bank.

433
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:33,867
Please do!

434
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:37,533
I'll be there on New Year's Eve.

435
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
Tell Grandma--

436
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,600
Em's shipment has arrived.

437
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,867
I finished cleaning!

438
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,133
HAPPY NEW YEAR

439
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:54,833
Em's first round of 1,200 orders
has shipped.

440
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,767
The second round of orders
has completed production.

441
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,767
Emotion's custom orders are also complete.

442
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,833
{\an8}Today's January 6th,
and if we ship everything here today,

443
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,333
we'll get over the hump for this season.

444
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,767
Sleep! I can finally sleep!

445
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,967
But it's going to come up soon,

446
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,900
the fall/winter trunk show.

447
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,933
Yeah.

448
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,100
That's in March, right?

449
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,433
March?

450
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,633
Let's not talk about that now.

451
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:32,800
Let's rest.

452
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,333
If we keep working, we'll be exhausted.

453
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,167
We need energy
in order to make something good.

454
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,233
Absolutely.

455
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Let's take a long break.

456
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,733
Let's see.

457
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,367
How about until February?

458
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,500
Two weeks.

459
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,000
For Emotion,

460
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,900
it'll be a summer vacation.

461
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,300
Yeah!

462
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,500
It's so heavy!

463
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,600
Why are fashion magazines so heavy?

464
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,933
THE IMPACT OF EMOTION X EM

465
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:43,933
STRETCH FABRIC PROVIDES FASHION FREEDOM

466
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,400
Fabric?

467
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,467
THE EVOLUTION OF SPANDEX GIVES SPORTSWEAR
THE VERSATILITY OF CASUAL WEAR

468
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:53,067
LINGERIE IS TRENDING TOWARD
ACTIVE AND SIMPLE

469
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
WE WILL BE CLOSED ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS

470
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,800
Are you guys going anywhere?

471
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,967
I'm going to take it easy at home.

472
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,333
And I have a cat.

473
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,100
You have a cat?

474
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,533
Is it really a cat,
or did you mean something else?

475
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,367
I don't know what you mean.

476
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,867
What about you, Mizuki?

477
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,133
I have to cater to my daughter.

478
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,300
Hot springs and crab for me.
I'm going to Kanazawa.

479
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:29,200
-Jealous?
-Don't forget souvenirs.

480
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,467
Okay.

481
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,300
And you, Ms. Nakatani?

482
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,033
I'm going to New York.

483
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,533
What? Wow.

484
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,700
Mr. Miki is putting on a show
for Fashion Week.

485
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,633
So I thought I'd go observe.

486
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,533
Such a dedicated learner!

487
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,067
What about Mayu and Kaji?

488
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,600
Why are you asking about us together?

489
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,333
You're not together yet?

490
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:53,367
Wait, what?

491
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:58,067
Well, you know.
I've got to finish my senior year project.

492
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,800
That's right, you're graduating.

493
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:03,167
Then you're only working here until March?

494
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,800
-Yes. I'm taking over the family business.
-We'll miss you.

495
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:10,467
And you, Mayu?

496
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:11,733
Are you going home to Nagano?

497
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:14,467
Well...

498
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm going to study up on lingerie.

499
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,933
Everyone's so admirable.

500
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:24,267
I'll bring back treats for everyone.

501
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:27,100
Sushi? Sweets?

502
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,433
Crab?

503
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,867
Where are you going, boss?

504
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,800
On vacation.

505
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:45,833
Okay.

506
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,067
Well, have a nice break!

507
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,200
Yes.

508
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:52,433
-See you later!
-See you later!

509
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,833
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

510
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,300
See you.

511
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:18,967
Don't look so alarmed.

512
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,633
Sorry.

513
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,767
I want to talk to you
about something else.

514
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay.

515
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,367
It's cold.

516
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,767
Let's talk inside.

517
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:35,967
Okay.

518
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,067
The coffeemaker's turned off,
so I made tea.

519
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:49,967
Thank you.

520
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,300
-Hot!
-Are you okay?

521
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,467
I'm sorry, I just poured boiling water.

522
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,367
Don't worry.

523
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,967
This? I really like it.

524
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,133
Thank you.

525
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
And?

526
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,633
Well...

527
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:28,700
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.

528
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,733
The day of the show...

529
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,267
I couldn't go home.

530
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,300
So I kind of hung around outside.

531
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:39,233
You were outside the entire time?

532
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,767
Yeah.

533
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
That's why your cold got worse.

534
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,533
Fumika was there.

535
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,867
I talked to her without realizing it.

536
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:57,100
I asked her how the show was.

537
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:05,167
She said the show was beautiful.

538
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,900
I felt her love for Emotion.

539
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:15,600
But I can't speak for her.

540
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,133
I think Fumika--

541
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,600
I know.

542
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:29,333
She just wants to make
what only she can make.

543
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,233
Right?

544
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,333
Me too.

545
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:59,100
I understand how she feels now.

546
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,333
I'm glad you told me.

547
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,500
Thank you.

548
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm glad that's how you feel about Fumika.

549
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,133
What is it?

550
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I...

551
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,233
I just saw something.

552
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,467
You saw it?

553
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,433
You mean...

554
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,367
my ulterior motives?

555
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:34,033
What only I can make.

556
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:38,700
Yes, it's true.

557
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,033
I want to make what only I can make too!

558
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,667
Everyone is creating something!

559
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,867
Mizuki made Em.

560
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:48,900
Fumika made Story.

561
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:53,367
You're still a little unclear,

562
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,300
but you're working on it.

563
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:58,633
Sorry for being so unclear.

564
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,900
So what can I create?

565
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,367
I've been thinking.

566
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:09,700
But looking at your face just now,
I saw it!

567
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:12,667
I'm glad...

568
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,233
I could be of service.

569
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,233
I'm...

570
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,700
going to create!

571
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,700
2 WEEKS LATER

572
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,533
This is...

573
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,233
What is it?

574
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,300
It's what's most natural for me.

575
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,967
It's what I'd want to wear.

576
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,133
The kind of lingerie I want to create...

577
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,633
is this.

578
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:37,300
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
