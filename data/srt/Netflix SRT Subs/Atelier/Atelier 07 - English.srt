00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,767
RUNWAY SHOW REHEARSAL

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,500
{\an8}Line those up right here.

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,733
{\an8}Hey, be careful with that!

4
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,200
I'm sorry to interrupt!

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,500
The models have arrived.

6
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:28,267
The fitting starts at 2:00 p.m.

7
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,333
All right.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,433
What should I do with this?

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,067
Wait. Let's see.

10
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,333
I'll put it right here.

11
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,500
Good morning!

12
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,000
Good morning.

13
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,200
Good morning.

14
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,833
You'll be provided with dressmakers
for the actual show.

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,733
Today is just a rehearsal,
so please get dressed by yourselves.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,233
You can use those robes.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,900
We only need two rows of chairs.

18
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,467
It's just to get an idea for the show.

19
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,200
Watch out for the runway.

20
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:04,633
I'd like to leave the kimonos in here
if there is enough space.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,767
Hey, watch out!

22
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,333
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Mayu!

24
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,167
Mayu?

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,900
Mayu!

26
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,000
Will she be all right?

27
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,133
Did she hit her head?

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,100
We just did an MRI, so we'll take a look.

29
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:31,867
Please, give us a moment.

30
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,900
But why won't she wake up?

31
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,033
Please, hold on.

32
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,033
5 WEEKS EARLIER

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
The venue.

34
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,967
As long as we can secure a venue,
we can proceed with the show.

35
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,967
But with our tiny budget,

36
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,533
our options are very limited.
And--

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,667
Japan Fashion Week takes place in October,

38
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,033
so most venues are already booked.

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,333
It would be great publicity
if we could do it during that time.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,067
But with our tiny budget--

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,900
Will you stop saying "tiny"?

42
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,867
Mr. Saruhashi worked very hard
to get investors.

43
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm sorry if it's too tiny for you.

44
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,800
Not at all.

45
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,433
Which days would work?

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,800
There are three venues still free
during the last week of October.

47
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:30,300
Okay, that works.

48
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:34,633
Let's go with whatever is easiest
and cheapest.

49
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,200
That sounds like fast food.

50
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,267
The exact opposite of
what Emotion stands for.

51
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,733
Even if it's cheap and easy,

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,700
if we're happy with the outcome,

53
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,667
then that's great, isn't it?

54
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,900
That's true.

55
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,633
Just like your wonderful second line.

56
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,700
That's right.

57
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,400
The samples for Em are so cute.

58
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,000
We can let customers pre-order
from the Em line during the show.

59
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,933
The factory's ready to go,

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,367
so we can sell at least 200 units.

61
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,567
{\an8}EM PRODUCTION PLAN

62
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,867
There's no issue with making
the product ahead of time.

63
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,767
Em is not custom-made.

64
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,333
We want to avoid having excess inventory.

65
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,700
We have the date and venue.

66
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:18,633
October 31st, Ebisu Square Hall.

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Boss! Boss!

68
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,400
What is it?

69
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,767
I'm busy looking for models.

70
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:31,600
Why are there so few lingerie models?

71
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,667
Lingerie models are looked down upon
in Japan.

72
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:37,633
Why? It means they have a great figure.

73
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,600
Great enough to show it off in lingerie.

74
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,700
I completely agree.

75
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,467
-Mayu has some news.
-What is it?

76
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:47,800
Well...

77
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:52,667
We're all set for October 31st
at Ebisu Square Hall.

78
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,333
As for the budget,

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,333
out of the 12 million yen
Mr. Saruhashi has brought in,

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
we'll use seven million.

81
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,000
We can use the rest
to produce garments for Em.

82
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,800
So we can only put the show on once.

83
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,267
We can only afford one day at that venue.

84
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,833
So we'll have to do the rehearsals
on the same day.

85
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,100
We'll invite 200 guests.

86
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,167
Sixty regular clients.

87
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,133
Forty guests from the public.

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,233
Eighty journalists.

89
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,067
And we're planning for
twenty celebrity guests as well.

90
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,733
As for the public guests,
we've advertised on shopping sites.

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,233
We're expecting to receive
100 or so entries.

92
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,267
We've taken care of the venue.
We've taken care of the guests.

93
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,000
And once we'll have chosen the models,

94
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,600
we'll just have to go through with it.

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,833
Emotion's first runway show.
We can do this.

96
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,867
Well...

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,067
Can I have your attention for a moment?

98
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,433
What's wrong?

99
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,200
I want to say something.

100
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,533
I'll only say this once.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
And never again.

102
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,667
For Emotion,

103
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,933
this little shop was everything.

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,933
It was my own little world.

105
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,433
Therefore,

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,867
I've never made a single compromise.

107
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,667
I'm proud to say that everything I've made

108
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,533
has been nothing short of perfect.

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
However,

110
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,133
that sort of obsession

111
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:40,033
only created a difficult situation

112
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,700
for someone trying to follow
in my footsteps.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,833
It made someone
who works with so much pride

114
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,933
throw away that pride.

115
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,833
And it crushed the hopes

116
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,633
of any young employee

117
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,900
wanting to enter the workforce.

118
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,267
And yet,

119
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,433
I refuse to change my ways.

120
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,733
I know now

121
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,367
that we must keep challenging ourselves.

122
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,000
Using Mizuki's designs,

123
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:25,267
we'll launch Em,
a mass-produced second line.

124
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,100
Our little trunk show

125
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,833
will now take place in a grand hall.

126
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,367
Scaled up to a runway show.

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
And many customers

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,200
new to Emotion will watch the show.

129
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,700
I hate to say it,

130
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,367
but for someone my age,

131
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,167
these challenges are very scary.

132
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,633
But I want to do this!

133
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,133
So please...

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,267
will you help me take on this challenge?

135
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,467
For the show,

136
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,333
we'll have 30 different styles
for 12 models.

137
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,967
And six different styles for
Mizuki's Em line.

138
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:44,267
The show itself will last 20 minutes,

139
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,867
but if we include the reception
and after-party,

140
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,967
we're looking at an hour and a half--

141
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,400
Wait.

142
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,367
For the show,

143
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,800
we'll start with 15 sets from Emotion,

144
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:01,900
then six sets for Mizuki's Em,

145
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:05,500
and then back to nine sets for Emotion.

146
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,567
That's 24 styles for Emotion alone.

147
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,767
We'll include past designs.

148
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,767
Of course, we'll need new designs as well.

149
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:22,767
But we want to show
as many of our products as we can.

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
If we do this,

151
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,933
we have to be better than Story.

152
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,000
You really hold a grudge.

153
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,900
I'm being serious.

154
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,167
Sorry.

155
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,500
The purpose of the show

156
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:41,067
is to increase brand awareness.

157
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,467
Which is why we invited the press,

158
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,433
as well as celebrities.

159
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,900
I know this isn't really your thing.

160
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,900
We're doing all of this for
Emotion and Em.

161
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,967
I know.

162
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,300
There's one thing that bothers me.

163
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,733
Yes?

164
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,267
What's the theme?

165
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,833
Here we go again with the theme.

166
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
Who's directing?

167
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,000
I know!

168
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,833
But we're out of money.

169
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,533
We have to do it ourselves.

170
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:14,867
I'll do the research.

171
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,567
I'm very determined.

172
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:17,967
I'll make it happen.

173
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,933
This is so cool!

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,233
But I'm sure it's very expensive.

175
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,967
That's so original!

176
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,467
So original!

177
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,633
That's so beautiful.

178
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,333
All right, that's enough.

179
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,467
I need to come up with a theme.

180
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,433
Who said you could eat that?

181
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,333
That's from Kyugetsudo, in Ginza.

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,667
It's their limited edition tsukimi dango!

183
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,267
They were so hard to get!

184
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,667
They were just sitting here.

186
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,767
You're not supposed to inhale them.

187
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,600
You're supposed to savor them
while watching a full moon.

188
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,700
I can't believe you!

189
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Okay, fine. I'm the tsukimi thief.

190
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,533
Where I'm from,

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,100
children were allowed to sneak away with

192
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,000
the sweet offerings made for tsukimi.

193
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,700
We called them "tsukimi thieves."

194
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,933
That's funny.

195
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:54,167
But I could never bring myself to do it.

196
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,000
So my mom told me,

197
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:03,567
"More luck will come
when sweets are stolen.

198
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,100
It makes people happy."

199
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,000
She said, "It's okay.

200
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
Go ahead and have fun."

201
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:26,167
I think I was two at the time.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,100
I don't really remember my mom very well.

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,467
But when I see the moon,

204
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,933
I feel as if I could see her face.

205
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,867
How strange.

206
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,467
These really go well with coffee.

207
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,233
It's really nice.

208
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,300
That image.

209
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,700
It's true.

210
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,233
The moon gives off a feminine image.

211
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,567
For the Emotion runway show,

212
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:32,933
we have a theme for
the 2016 spring/summer collection.

213
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,300
MOON

214
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,433
Moon.

215
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,300
Moon?

216
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,367
Why?

217
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,833
I was originally thinking of "Flower."

218
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,500
But "Flower" was stolen by Story.

219
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,733
That's a low blow.

220
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,033
I'm just teasing.

221
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,733
I really want to go with "Moon."

222
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Any reason?

223
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,567
The moon gives off a feminine image.

224
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:04,867
It's said that more births occur
during a full moon.

225
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:10,067
I feel that there's a relationship between
the moon and a woman's biorhythms.

226
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:15,400
And the moon is multifaceted,

227
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,167
which is a very feminine trait.

228
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,400
That's true.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,100
"Moon" would be perfect for Emotion.

230
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,400
The theme will be "Moon."

231
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,400
Let's go with that.

232
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,700
A lingerie show?

233
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,967
I heard from a photographer

234
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,167
that Emotion is planning one.

235
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:41,900
It seems the press will be there.
It'll be a pretty big deal.

236
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,333
Well... I see.

237
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,667
So...

238
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,767
Only the white rose
required a correction, right?

239
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,500
I'll be able to take care of it this week.

240
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,167
It's refreshing to see you being so calm.

241
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:00,833
What?

242
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,733
Excuse me for saying this,

243
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,167
but I didn't expect you to have
that much talent for design.

244
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,633
But you consider ideas from both
the marketing team

245
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,900
and the development team.

246
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,500
It's truly wonderful.

247
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,800
Thank you.

248
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,533
When Ms. Nishizawa left,

249
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,967
I was worried

250
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:25,033
that if you failed,
it would be the end of Story.

251
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,600
No, you weren't.

252
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,667
How much of an impact
can one individual have?

253
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:35,867
If I fail, you'll simply replace me.

254
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,267
For that reason,

255
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,833
I'll hang on to Story
no matter what happens.

256
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,933
And I won't lose to Emotion.

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,300
Welcome.

258
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:57,400
Thanks for coming on your day off.

259
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:00,900
I'm so excited to hear that
Emotion is doing a runway show.

260
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,300
Any knowledge you can share
on how to show a collection

261
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,733
would be very helpful.

262
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,467
"Save the date"?

263
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,800
What's that?

264
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:16,833
It's useful for confirming guests.

265
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,400
For guests you really want at the show,

266
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:22,200
you send them save-the-date cards
before sending out the invitations,

267
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,433
so they can keep their schedules clear.

268
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,933
Follow an order of priority.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,100
-The most important guests first?
-Yes.

270
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:34,033
Such as the editor-in-chief of
a fashion magazine?

271
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:42,633
It looks good.

272
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,100
{\an8}Wow.

273
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm so disappointed.

274
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,400
It's such bad timing.

275
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,167
I really wanted to be a part of your show.

276
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,300
It's okay.
You're going to Paris.

277
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,600
It was so sudden.

278
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,333
I still can't believe it.

279
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,533
You were chosen as the face of Sumeragi!

280
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,967
It's amazing!

281
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,333
{\an8}You look beautiful.

282
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,967
{\an8}It's limited to the Asian editions.

283
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,667
That's still amazing!

284
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,767
You've got an interview in five minutes.

285
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,433
-We'll then start the afternoon shoot.
-Yes.

286
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,167
I'm sorry. You're busy.

287
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,300
You're meeting with Ms. Nagai, right?

288
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,367
She's here today.

289
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,700
<i>Conscious</i> is an influential magazine.

290
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,167
You should go for it.

291
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:50,133
Thanks.

292
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:54,433
Beautiful. Beautiful.

293
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,600
Looking good.

294
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,567
What do you think?

295
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,767
It looks good.

296
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,867
We're good!

297
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,267
That's it for today.

298
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,100
Ms. Nagai.

299
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,567
I'm sorry to bother you.

300
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm Ms. Tokita, from Emotion.

301
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:23,700
I know I've repeatedly been discourteous
in the past.

302
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:29,800
I came here today to ask
if you would come to our show.

303
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,267
{\an8}SHUMEI PUBLISHING

304
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,733
I'll leave that up to you.

305
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Good morning.

306
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,767
Thank you for letting me observe the shoot
the other day.

307
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:54,833
I wanted to ask again
if you would come to our show.

308
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,533
I've already told you
I'll be busy that day.

309
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,667
It's true, having Ms. Nagai at the show
would make a big difference.

310
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:09,067
Wherever she goes, the celebrities follow.

311
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,533
Yes.

312
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,933
For some international collections,

313
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,833
if there's a guest they absolutely want,

314
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,333
they'll even change the date
to accommodate their schedule.

315
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,833
But our venue...

316
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,033
What do you mean?

317
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,433
If you can't make it,
there's no point in even doing this show.

318
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,267
So we've already canceled the show
for October 31st.

319
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,300
You canceled it?

320
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:46,867
We've decided to change the date
in order to accommodate your schedule.

321
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,100
I'd like to ask again.

322
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:55,767
Which day would work best for you?

323
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,600
Well, let me take a look.

324
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,733
If it were on November 1st--

325
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,333
Thank you!

326
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,767
So we'll schedule the show
for November 1st.

327
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm so glad.

328
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,367
We're looking forward to seeing you.

329
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,233
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,633
We'd like to cancel for October 31st.

331
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:26,567
By the way, how does November 1st look?

332
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,667
It's fully booked.

333
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:34,133
Of course it is.

334
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,233
I see.

335
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,667
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,067
It's November 1st.

337
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,233
Yes.

338
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,667
How's it going?

339
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:05,167
I see. Don't worry.
I'll find a venue.

340
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,667
You have to work on the show.
We're running out of time.

341
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,433
But still.

342
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,867
Thanks to you, what's important
is the show, not the venue.

343
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,800
You should hire a professional director.

344
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,133
We can transfer a part of the budget.

345
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,400
Your expression says otherwise.

346
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,000
You're right.

347
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,667
I can use every yen we have right now.

348
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,367
The shipping costs are really hurting us.

349
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Don't worry.

350
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,967
We can direct the show ourselves.

351
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,200
We know Emotion better than anyone.

352
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,800
We can do it.

353
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,067
Shoes?

354
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,433
Yes, of course.
We need shoes.

355
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

356
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:59,267
We'll have them ready for the models
come audition time.

357
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,567
SHOES

358
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:04,333
No. I said, "Moon."

359
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,333
Yes, the theme is "Moon."

360
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,600
Can we install a device
to display that image?

361
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,267
SET INSTALLATION

362
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,167
Usage rights fees?

363
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,367
Of course there is.

364
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,567
To play music,
we have to pay usage rights fees.

365
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,033
MUSIC

366
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,767
Do we need that many
hair and makeup artists?

367
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,467
So we need separate people
doing hair and makeup?

368
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,533
We need 10 artists?

369
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,967
And their assistants?

370
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:36,300
What's a fitter?

371
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,967
What should I do?

372
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:54,233
Mayu, Mrs. Ono is here.

373
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,000
She wants to see you.

374
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,467
Okay.

375
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,533
Welcome.

376
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,800
What's wrong?

377
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,067
Did something happen?

378
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:21,133
I'm sorry,
things are a little crazy right now.

379
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,133
{\an8}ANMITSU 700 YEN
CREAM ANMITSU 900 YEN

380
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,400
That's silly of you.

381
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:33,500
Trying to do everything on your own.

382
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,033
Yes.

383
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:42,133
But I understand the feeling
of wanting to do things yourself.

384
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,367
Yes.

385
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:51,600
But you know, a strong person
isn't afraid to ask for help.

386
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,333
Amazing.

387
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,033
These are furisodes, right?

388
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,667
Are they all made of silk?

389
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:07,033
My son is married

390
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,533
to the daughter of a kimono shop owner.

391
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,200
These are all too old for the shop.

392
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,867
Please, take them.

393
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,033
I also have obis and fans.

394
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,167
Just let me know if you need them.

395
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,233
Kimonos could work.

396
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
The moon and the kimono.

397
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,367
It's like the tale of <i>Kaguyahime!</i>

398
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,833
Thank you so much.

399
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,267
Good luck.

400
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,700
Really?

401
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,500
That sounds wonderful.

402
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:45,233
I'll ask my teacher
if she can play the violin for you.

403
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,233
Thank you so much!

404
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
This is Ms. Matsubara, who does our PR.

405
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,900
I've already told her about the show.

406
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,300
I'm Ms. Matsubara.

407
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,667
It's nice to meet you.

408
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,067
I'm Ms. Tokita, from Emotion.

409
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:07,767
We'll lend you the 12 pairs of shoes,
along with three backups for the runway.

410
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,967
Please let me know if you also need bags.

411
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,867
Thank you so much!

412
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,700
If you could include our brand name
in the press kit,

413
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:20,600
along with shots of our shoes,
we'd appreciate it.

414
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Ms. Tokita.

415
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,500
I can't thank you enough for your help.

416
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,733
I'm back!

417
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,233
I got shoes.

418
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,633
Welcome back.

419
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
That's great!

420
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,000
The Em line has also been taken care of.

421
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,867
Really? You're done?

422
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,700
They just came in from the factory.

423
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,367
Look!

424
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,400
They're so cute!

425
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,567
They look good.

426
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,367
They don't look like
they're part of a second line.

427
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,867
I'm quite proud of them.

428
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:09,833
These will sell.

429
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
We'll sell them!

430
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,133
-I'm back!
-Kaji?

431
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,000
Are you okay, Kaji?

432
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,400
Capacity of 200 to 300.

433
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,167
1.2 million yen per day.

434
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,833
I negotiated the extra fees
from 300,000 yen to 200,000 yen.

435
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,633
The Aoyama Garden Hall, November 1st.

436
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,800
I got it!

437
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,500
Kaji.

438
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,633
Are we ready for this?

439
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,267
Yes.

440
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,033
Please, have the money ready.

441
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,200
What's it called?

442
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:39,067
The Aoyama Garden Hall.

443
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:47,733
It's nice, right?

444
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,333
Yes, I see.

445
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
The evening moon is mysterious,

446
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:54,300
and the daytime moon is modest,
hidden within the sky.

447
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:55,700
That's right.

448
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,867
It's an expression of a woman's
multifaceted nature.

449
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:04,100
My daughter's mood is constantly changing.

450
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,233
Right?

451
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,267
Speaking of the moon,

452
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:12,633
the wedding we just coordinated
had the moon as a theme.

453
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,300
We still have the set that was used.

454
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,800
Should I get it for you?

455
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,133
Are you serious?

456
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,067
I'll call them now.

457
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,100
<i>Kaguyahime?</i>

458
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,333
I wonder if my daughter will disappear
to the moon someday as well.

459
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Hello?

460
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:34,300
There's even a really beautiful
bridal kimono.

461
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:37,967
I think it'll be gorgeous
if we use it at the end.

462
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,133
Bridal kimono?

463
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,733
I see...

464
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,167
We'll have live music,

465
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:46,467
and turn it into a celebration.

466
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,967
She's like a celebrity now.

467
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,567
I shouldn't have let her model
for that magazine.

468
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,000
They agreed.

469
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:54,333
Where should they take it?

470
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,600
We can really have it?

471
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,133
Yes, and it looks really nice too.

472
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,600
They spent a lot of money on it.

473
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
Thank you.

474
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,667
What's wrong?

475
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,067
I'm just so happy.

476
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,800
So many people are helping me.

477
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,567
I'm glad.

478
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:43,533
Okay.

479
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,767
You're still working?

480
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,367
Just a little longer.

481
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,767
Have some coffee.

482
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,667
Thank you.

483
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:11,233
It's so good.

484
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,100
I've got hair, makeup
and the fitters covered.

485
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,700
There will be two of each
to fit the models.

486
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,033
I'm so glad. Thank you.

487
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,433
I'm just disappointed that
I couldn't get a better deal.

488
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,200
That can't be helped.

489
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,000
It's very glamorous.

490
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,967
It's really happening.

491
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:36,567
Yes.

492
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,467
Are you okay?
Are you getting enough sleep?

493
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,167
If I were to lie down right now,
I'd fall asleep in a second.

494
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,767
Me too.

495
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,933
Then you should go home.

496
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,667
You need to rest before the event.

497
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,433
You too, Mayu!

498
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,933
I'm fine.

499
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,233
Go home.

500
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,600
But...

501
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,233
Okay, good night.

502
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,033
Thank you for your help.

503
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Wait.

504
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:33,667
The image of the moon...

505
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,300
REHEARSAL DAY

506
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,133
Yes.

507
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,100
The doctor saw her.

508
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,600
But she hasn't woken up?

509
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,167
I'll head over to the hospital.

510
00:29:57,233 --> 00:30:01,200
<i>No, you can leave her to me.</i>

511
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:04,500
Let me know if anything happens.

512
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:05,767
<i>Yes.</i>

513
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,567
Don't let your hair fall forward.

514
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:14,700
Okay.

515
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,533
I hope Mayu is okay.

516
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,333
<i>It's really nice.</i>

517
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,867
<i>That image.</i>

518
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:29,667
It's true.

519
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:33,200
The moon gives off a feminine image.

520
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,800
It's so beautiful.

521
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,233
Yes, it is.

522
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,733
I slept so well.

523
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:24,067
What? Kaji?

524
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,000
A hospital?

525
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,033
Mayu.

526
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,133
Are you okay?

527
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,033
The runway hit you.

528
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,633
Actually, it didn't.

529
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,000
But you fell and lost consciousness.

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,133
Sorry.

531
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:02,833
I think I just fell asleep.

532
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,667
-What?
-Well, I fell.

533
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,133
And my body became limp.

534
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,633
The ground felt so nice and cool.

535
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
And then, I passed out.

536
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:18,533
I see.

537
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,433
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,600
Did you worry about me?

539
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,967
Well, you'd been working so hard.

540
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,300
But I'm really glad you're okay.

541
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,267
If anything had happened to you,

542
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,700
I would have--

543
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,700
The fitting!

544
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,767
I'm so glad you're okay.

545
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,267
I'm sorry I made you worry.

546
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,267
What's wrong?

547
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:30,167
Do you feel sick?

548
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,567
No.

549
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,600
Will you stop it?

550
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,300
Please, stop it.
I'm sorry. Please, stop it!

551
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
I'm sorry.

552
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,733
Please.

553
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,900
Just forget everything.

554
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,133
What I had in mind

555
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,267
wasn't this.

556
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:06,967
I want to impress people,
but not like this.

557
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,400
The kimonos.

558
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,267
The accessories.

559
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,100
The lights, the music.

560
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,867
Everything is beautiful.

561
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,500
But this is not it.

562
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,167
What I want...

563
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,333
the guests to see...

564
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,133
is what I see.

565
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,333
Emotion's...

566
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,767
truly beautiful lingerie!

567
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,367
Nothing else.

568
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,133
Everyone left.

569
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,733
I know it's wrong of me.

570
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,900
After what happened with Story,

571
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,133
I wanted revenge,

572
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,333
I wanted to get back at them.

573
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,833
But I was wrong.

574
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,600
And there were people

575
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:47,600
who pushed me in the right direction.

576
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,833
So many people have helped me.

577
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,000
But none of that matters.

578
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,867
Does it?

579
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,367
You now have a clear image
of what you want.

580
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,933
But if you create something that doesn't
feel right to you,

581
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,767
then you're not being true to yourself.

582
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,933
It'll be okay!

583
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,567
I'll make the formal apologies.

584
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,700
What should I do?

585
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:42,933
What should I do?

586
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,333
The invitations just need to be sent out.

587
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,833
The press kit is done.

588
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,133
Ms. Nagai is coming.

589
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,767
The celebrities will be there.

590
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,200
The press will be there.

591
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:53,467
And yet!

592
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:57,267
I rejected everything
just based on gut feeling!

593
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,700
What should I do?

594
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,900
I only have one week!

595
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,533
One week...

596
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,033
Are you okay?

597
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,600
I should get the brandy.

598
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,133
How much can you pay?

599
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,267
STAGE DIRECTOR
TSUNEHIKO MIKI

600
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,767
I usually don't work
for anything less than

601
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,100
one million yen.

602
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:31,167
But my plans for November 1st
happened to fall through.

603
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,167
After Japan Fashion Week,

604
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:36,267
I was planning to go to the Maldives

605
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,467
with a model I've had my eye on.

606
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:40,800
But she turned me down yesterday.

607
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,333
-Female?
-Male.

608
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,333
I feel depressed, so I want to work.

609
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:48,333
How much will you pay?

610
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,000
I won't do it for free.

611
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:53,067
I'm a pro, after all.

612
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,700
Pro?

613
00:38:57,467 --> 00:39:00,567
I've seen this name before.

614
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:03,167
Tsunehiko Miki.

615
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:05,933
Wait! Are you the Tsunehiko Miki?

616
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Here it is.

617
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,067
Take a look.

618
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:12,133
Wait.

619
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,933
You staged this, Mr. Miki?

620
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,133
This one too?

621
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,500
This is the one I said was so original!

622
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:28,533
I watched all of these
while doing my research!

623
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,033
Research?

624
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,267
So, what are you going to do?

625
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,867
No.

626
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:41,333
I couldn't possibly ask
anyone else for help.

627
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,733
Are you stupid?

628
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,800
You know what I can't stand?

629
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,200
Amateurs who think
they can impress people

630
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,533
without spending any money.

631
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,200
Thinking they can move people's hearts,

632
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,333
and put on a polished show.

633
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,600
All on their own!

634
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,167
You're just an amateur.

635
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,800
And you think you can pull it off?

636
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,200
I can't stand that kind of naive thinking!

637
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:07,767
This isn't some school festival.

638
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,167
Don't underestimate my job!

639
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,767
A job that impresses others

640
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,800
can only be done by a skilled pro.

641
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,533
Now that you work at Emotion,

642
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,700
you've had the opportunity to see that.

643
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,167
Determination alone won't get you there.

644
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:32,000
Hand over the cash.

645
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:33,433
My fee

646
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,067
is open for negotiation.

647
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,800
This runway is very simple.

648
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:07,967
The invitation cards?

649
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:16,200
Invitations

650
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,600
are like magic cards.

651
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,500
On each envelope,

652
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,900
add a mark.

653
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:28,033
Okay.

654
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,667
The seating chart?

655
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,467
Who will you seat in the first row?

656
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:38,267
Just hand me your guest list!

657
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,700
That looks nice.

658
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,767
How long have you been working on it?

659
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,633
You're so mean.

660
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,800
You already had a plan in mind.
You should've told her from the start.

661
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,733
At some point,
I have to let go of her hand.

662
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,133
Otherwise, she won't grow.

663
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,133
And neither will I.

664
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,300
And neither will Emotion.

665
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,567
It's good, isn't it?

666
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:27,067
She concluded that what she created
wasn't good enough.

667
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,300
And she was right.

668
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:36,367
THE DAY OF THE RUNWAY SHOW

669
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:38,833
{\an8}FOR EMOTION
THE AOYAMA GARDEN HALL

670
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,033
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

671
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,467
Thank you.

672
00:42:42,533 --> 00:42:44,133
The day has arrived.

673
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Yes.

674
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:49,367
Thanks for everything.

675
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,900
You really helped me, Kaji.

676
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,333
We don't have time.
Let's hurry.

677
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,967
You're right.

678
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,133
Let's go.

679
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,933
Yes.

680
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:49,267
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
