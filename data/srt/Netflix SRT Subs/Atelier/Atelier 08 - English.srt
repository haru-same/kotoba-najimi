1
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,367
Hello?

2
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,133
It's finally arrived?

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,767
Right. Okay.

4
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,200
Coffee beans?

5
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:54,800
For the after-party?

6
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:56,133
Yes.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,467
They were supposed to come in through
Narita Airport yesterday.

8
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,300
But they arrived only now.

9
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,200
You're going to Narita now?

10
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:05,300
Don't worry, I've got a car.

11
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,467
Okay. Just call if you need anything.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,900
Hello, Sari?

13
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:21,433
Here, give it to me.

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,700
Thank you.

15
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,633
<i>Mayu, I just found out.</i>

16
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,733
<i>I made it into the Paris collection!</i>

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,667
Really? Congratulations!

18
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,600
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

19
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,200
You're a supermodel now!

20
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,500
<i>Not yet.</i>

21
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,167
<i>But this is my chance.</i>

22
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>I had to tell you.</i>

23
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,300
<i>I'm sorry, I know the show is today.</i>

24
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,233
Yeah, we're getting ready now.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,867
<i>I'm in Singapore right now.</i>

26
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,800
<i>We just finished the shoot</i>
<i>and I'm about to head home.</i>

27
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,133
<i>I probably won't make it.</i>

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

29
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,267
Don't worry.

30
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,067
I'll show you the video
next time I see you.

31
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,933
Anyway, congratulations!

32
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,400
It's no time to slack off! Come on!

33
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,800
The day has finally arrived.

34
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,600
As you can see,

35
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,933
my trusted team
will finish getting the floor ready,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,333
so there's no need to worry.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,433
The progression of today's runway show,

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,967
both front and backstage,

39
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,200
will be directed by me.

40
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,467
However, during the show,

41
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,467
I'll be upstairs in the control room

42
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,700
and won't have access backstage.

43
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,233
All directions for the models,

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,533
including fitting and timing,

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,067
will come from you.

46
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:40,100
Normally,
my assistant takes care of all that.

47
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,167
I'm sorry,
we weren't able to cover the cost.

48
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,467
Either way, failure is not an option.

49
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,700
The run-through is your only opportunity

50
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,400
to determine your exact positions.

51
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,500
Use it to figure out
exactly what you need to do.

52
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,167
Got it?

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,900
Ms. Nanjo, Mizuki, this way.

54
00:02:58,967 --> 00:02:59,967
-Okay.
-Okay.

55
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,967
This area is for final checks.

56
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,867
This is where the designers
check if everything looks right.

57
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:11,967
Make sure the models look
perfect at this point.

58
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,167
I understand.

59
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,400
This is the runway entrance.

60
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:19,567
At my cue,
you'll give the models the go-ahead.

61
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,067
You and I will control
the pacing of the show.

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,500
I don't perform very well under pressure.

63
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,667
Even if you have to throw up, just do it.

64
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:28,867
That's how this industry works.

65
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,433
Mr. Saruhashi,
you'll watch over the staff.

66
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,567
You'll line up the models
in their proper order.

67
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,000
Keep them on the alert.

68
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,333
Smack their butts if you have to.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,067
I might get in trouble if I do that.

70
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,467
For today, it's fine.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,300
You'll communicate with the fitting area.

72
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:50,033
You're not the type
to get flustered by naked girls, are you?

73
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,333
My sister used to tackle me
after coming out of the bath, naked.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,867
Perfect! I'll leave it to you then.

75
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:03,833
You, make sure the guests are seated

76
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,767
in their designated spots.

77
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:10,067
If we can fill the first row
with celebrities and industry big shots,

78
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,033
the show will be 90% successful.

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Yes.

80
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,400
I'll drag them here if I have to.

81
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,300
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,467
-Please help her.
-Of course.

83
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,733
I'll seat the Emotion customers

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,900
so that you can attend to the guests.

85
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,567
I'll do my best.

86
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,200
Got it?

87
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,500
You understand your roles?

88
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,800
For the most part.

89
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,300
Then let's hear a word from the designer.

90
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:41,600
Right now?

91
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,100
But it's only 10:30 a.m.

92
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,500
We won't have time later.

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
It's funny...

94
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,200
that a day like this would come.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,633
This will be a day

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll remember on my deathbed.

97
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,633
Let's make sure...

98
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:24,967
we present our guests
with an amazing vision of Emotion.

99
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,467
All done?

100
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,100
Well then, the show begins at 7:30 p.m.

101
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,333
Let's aim for a safe and perfect show!

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Go!

103
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,467
All right!

104
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,733
Yes!

105
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,167
All the apparel is ready, right?

106
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,400
They'll arrive here at...

107
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,300
They'll be here at 2:00 p.m.

108
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,300
Then let's go over the style board.

109
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,367
ANNA CALLING

110
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,233
Excuse me for a second.

111
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,433
Hi, what's up?
I'm--

112
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,333
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,367
<i>I can't come to the show today.</i>

114
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,533
What? Why not?

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,967
<i>Sayuki asked me to hang out with her.</i>

116
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,933
Just turn her down.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,033
I really want you to be here, Anna.

118
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,233
<i>I know. But...</i>

119
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,633
Was it really Sayuki?

120
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,100
Who really asked you?

121
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,433
And hang out where?

122
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,167
<i>Never mind.</i>

123
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,600
Wait!

124
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,167
What was that about?

125
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,167
Twelve years old, right?

126
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,933
It's a boy.

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
I hate you for being so straightforward!

128
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,333
Wow.

129
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,200
Professionals are amazing, aren't they?

130
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,167
Yes.

131
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:38,667
I thought we'd come across
a lot more challenges.

132
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,433
But everything is going so smoothly.

133
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,867
Yes.

134
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,433
Are you nervous?

135
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,900
You're acting a little--

136
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,833
The models will arrive at 1:00 p.m.

137
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,400
So have the staff
take their lunch break now.

138
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,533
Yes.

139
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,667
Let's go.

140
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,900
Here are the bentos for lunch.

141
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,700
There's also coffee and tea.

142
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:08,967
Thank you.

143
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,433
SHIKISHIMA COFFEE
MR. YAMAZAKI CALLING

144
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,200
-Hello?
<i>-Yes.</i>

145
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:18,767
<i>I'm at customs in Narita.</i>

146
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,933
<i>We still haven't gotten</i>
<i>the coffee cleared.</i>

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,933
<i>But I'll make sure to be on time,</i>
<i>so please don't worry.</i>

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,867
Well, worst-case scenario,

149
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,033
we'll just use the coffee we already have.

150
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:31,733
Okay?

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,900
I know you're going out.

152
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm asking with whom?

153
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,600
Anna?

154
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,133
Hey!

155
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,833
This section is "N" for north.

156
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,367
And this side is "S" for south.

157
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,100
The front row is A,
the second row is B

158
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,600
and the third row is C.

159
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,700
Seats six to 12
will be for the main guests.

160
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,500
So seat nine is the best seat.

161
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:06,033
And seat SA-09 will be for Ms. Nagai,
from <i>Conscious.</i>

162
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,267
She'll be our VIP guest this evening.

163
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,367
Yes.

164
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,200
CONSCIOUS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
MS. CHIKA NAGAI

165
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:14,867
In seat NA-13,
we have Mr. Fujimura from Vanderbilt's.

166
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,233
NA-14 will be for Fumika.

167
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I wonder if Fumi will come.

168
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
I think she will.

169
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,033
Something isn't right.

170
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Oh, no. Here it comes.

171
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,767
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm going to do this over.

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,867
What?

174
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,600
{\an8}This access code on the invitation,

175
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,500
{\an8}when you enter it on our site,

176
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,633
it'll direct you to the Em pre-order page.

177
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,867
And at the end of the show,

178
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,900
we'll start taking orders.

179
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,300
Each of the six Em series
is limited to 200 sets.

180
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,633
I hope our product sells out today.

181
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,967
PAGE NOT FOUND

182
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,867
That's strange,
the site should be accessible.

183
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,533
Excuse me.

184
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,433
I'm going to make a call.

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,833
Wait! Wait!

186
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,267
Will everything be okay?

187
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm glad I brought it.

188
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,233
You're really going to do it over?

189
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,633
Now?

190
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
Well...

191
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,367
it just didn't seem right to me.

192
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,333
Not that again!

193
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,267
You always do this at the last minute!

194
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,267
That's normal.

195
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,700
Mr. Miki.

196
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:40,667
Designers always try to perfect their work
until the last minute.

197
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,233
Attempting to reach their limits
is what professionals do.

198
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,467
Well...

199
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,533
I suppose.

200
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,567
That's how it is.

201
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,867
You.

202
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,633
Come here.

203
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:58,933
Okay.

204
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,400
You're burning up.

205
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,467
What's this?

206
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,733
You need to go home.

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,967
I'm okay. I took some medication.
I can do it--

208
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,033
No.

209
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,900
You're in charge of communications.

210
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,500
If you collapse backstage

211
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,100
and the show is ruined,

212
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,633
will you take full responsibility?

213
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,633
-I won't collapse. I can do it!
-You can't!

214
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,533
Go home.

215
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,967
You've already been working
for half a day.

216
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,000
You could've gotten someone else sick.

217
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,100
Do you understand
how inconsiderate that is?

218
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Please, leave.

219
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:46,900
Mr. Miki, please be considerate
of Kaji's feelings.

220
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,433
Thanks to Kaji, this venue--

221
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,200
Today, I have only one criteria.

222
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:58,167
I will do what I have to for the show
to be executed perfectly.

223
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,400
Your feelings are not important.

224
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,567
Are you okay?

225
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,633
Should I call a cab?

226
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,467
I'm fine. I can walk.

227
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,133
I'm fine, really.

228
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,233
And yet...

229
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,367
But...

230
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,000
what Mr. Miki said--

231
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,300
I understand.

232
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,733
It's so frustrating.

233
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,100
I really thought I'd get you drunk
at the after-party.

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,233
That would never happen.

235
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Well...

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,267
I wish you good luck for tonight.

237
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
We've started the technical rehearsal.

238
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,733
The run-through will begin at 5:00 p.m.

239
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,667
I told you that hurts!

240
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,633
It pinches here!

241
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,400
We've added cushioning

242
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,767
and an adhesive bandage.

243
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,867
I can't walk like this!

244
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:57,633
Get me a different size.

245
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,433
That's the only size
we could get for that model.

246
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,533
Then get a different pair.

247
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
You were fine with these
during the auditions.

248
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,400
Then it was fine, but now it's not!

249
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,833
Please, wait a moment.

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,467
Models act like everything is fine
during the auditions

251
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,000
because they want the job.

252
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,933
But now, it's totally different!

253
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,033
Maybe she just wants to complain.

254
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,233
The other girls were saying that

255
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,567
Kaoru failed an audition earlier

256
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,800
and she's in a really bad mood.

257
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:33,267
She's been doing well lately.

258
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,833
Her ego must be hurt.

259
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,300
Kaoru's presence does add value.

260
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,567
She's up for the main and last parts
of the show.

261
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,200
She has the spotlight.

262
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,267
We'd better do something about the shoes.

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,067
Wait! Hold on a second!

264
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,333
How about these?

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,533
Don't worry, I've only worn them once.

266
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,667
What?

267
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,367
I was going to change into them

268
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,967
when it would be time to
greet the guests.

269
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,767
It's the same brand.

270
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,700
I really liked them at the fitting.

271
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,333
So I bought them too!

272
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,267
They were so expensive!

273
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,467
What?

274
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:21,767
Here,

275
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,633
you can try these on too.

276
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,233
Ms. Nanjo.

277
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,633
Or these.

278
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,333
I just bought them.

279
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,933
I was going to wear them today.

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,767
But I'll be backstage.

281
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,833
Mine are not very stylish, but...

282
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,200
And these too.

283
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:45,400
Try them.

284
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,033
These as well.

285
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,233
If they don't work,

286
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,433
I can cut the straps.

287
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,767
Maybe I can add ribbons.

288
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,933
We'll make it work.

289
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,600
We'll make you walk no matter what.

290
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,433
The straps!

291
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,300
Maybe the straps...

292
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,667
It's because this piece faces forward!

293
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,967
I'm so sorry.

294
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,933
How about now?

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,567
Stop, stop!

296
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,333
The timing is really off!

297
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,967
Mizuki.

298
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,000
When I say go, you tap their shoulder.

299
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,533
It's very simple.

300
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,700
I'm sorry! One more time, please.

301
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:09,033
Excuse me.

302
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,867
It's a little hard
being back here on my own.

303
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't worry.

304
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,733
An angel is coming down.

305
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
What?

306
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,833
Hello.

307
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,467
Mr. Miki asked me to come.

308
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,933
I'm Yuri Konno, Mayu's friend.

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,267
Yuri?

310
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,000
She's very elegant.

311
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,867
I can't believe
she's a country girl like you.

312
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:35,600
Backstage, elegance is irrelevant.

313
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,100
Let's start from number 13!

314
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,567
<i>Models, stand by.</i>

315
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,733
<i>Go!</i>

316
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,233
I can direct in the fitting area.

317
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Please.

318
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,900
<i>Stop, stop!</i>

319
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,067
Again?

320
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,267
<i>What's wrong with Kaoru?</i>

321
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,333
Turn on the lights.

322
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Are you okay?

323
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,433
Are you okay, Kaoru?

324
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,433
The light hit my eye.

325
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,300
This bruise stands out.

326
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,433
This is where it stands out the most.

327
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,467
I'll use foundation to hide it.
Please, let me walk!

328
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,533
Please.

329
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,733
Let's find a replacement.

330
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,133
Is there anything you can do?

331
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,933
Yes, I realize it's last minute.

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,733
No? I understand.

333
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,567
I understand...

334
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,133
Thank you for trying.

335
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,767
Can you make it in time?

336
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,033
We need it by 8:30 p.m.

337
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll make it happen!

338
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,833
They don't do lingerie.

339
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,267
They also said no.

340
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,600
Boss.

341
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,500
We can't find a replacement.

342
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,333
I see.

343
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,867
It's the main and last parts of the show,

344
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,700
so it can't be just anyone.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
I can do it.

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,067
I apologize for earlier.

347
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,733
I had a bad audition this morning.

348
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
I let my emotions get the best of me.

349
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm very embarrassed.

350
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,533
I promise, I won't fail.

351
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,133
I can walk!

352
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,633
Please, let me walk!

353
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,100
From afar,

354
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,267
maybe you can't see the bruise.

355
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,900
Can you stand?

356
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:56,967
Yes!

357
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:07,967
With this...

358
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,767
It's almost time.

359
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,367
I'm counting on you.

360
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,167
Yes.

361
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,600
<i>The beans just got cleared!</i>

362
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,333
<i>I'm going to get them now</i>

363
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,767
<i>and head back--</i>

364
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,933
I'm sorry!

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,867
-You can forget about the coffee.
<i>-What?</i>

366
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,333
I have a favor to ask you.

367
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,000
Check! Switch to audience lights.

368
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,067
Okay.

369
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,267
Please, take one.

370
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,500
<i>There are 67 guests</i>
<i>in the waiting area, Mr. Miki.</i>

371
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,267
<i>I'll let the press in first.</i>

372
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:43,900
This way, please.

373
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,533
Guest interviews
are in the waiting area only.

374
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,033
<i>We're on schedule.</i>

375
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,100
The start time is 7:30 p.m.

376
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,367
<i>Let's make it happen.</i>

377
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,033
Open the doors.

378
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,433
Good evening.
May I see your card?

379
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,267
Thank you for coming.

380
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,100
Good evening.

381
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,733
This way, Mr. Tamaki.

382
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,433
On the invitation card envelopes,

383
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,133
there's an "E" for Emotion,

384
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,167
an "M",

385
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,200
or an "O" marked on each one.

386
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:42,667
"E" is for the front row.

387
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,100
"M" is for the second row.

388
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:47,267
And "O" is for the third row.

389
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:52,333
Thank you for coming, Mr. Tamaki.

390
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,900
This way, please.

391
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,267
The second round
will be a race against the clock.

392
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:59,633
Worst-case scenario,
we'll send out whoever is ready first.

393
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
So please, follow directions.

394
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,867
We want to avoid confusion.

395
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,200
So in here,
please listen to my directions.

396
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,233
Double-check the photos on the rack.

397
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,133
Please.

398
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,233
Welcome.

399
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you for coming, Ms. Yamakawa.

400
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,633
Sitting next to Ms. Nagai
will be the actress

401
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,367
Ritsuko Yamakawa
and her husband.

402
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,600
MR. AND MRS. RITSUKO YAMAKAWA

403
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,067
She's a regular customer.

404
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,100
Here we are, Mrs. Yamakawa
and Mr. Yamakawa.

405
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,233
Please enjoy the show.

406
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,567
Thank you.

407
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,867
SA-9 CONSCIOUS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
MS. CHIKA NAGAI

408
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,467
In seat NA-11,
we have model Mariko Tamura.

409
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,633
She's beautiful, isn't she?

410
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:57,133
And she'll be here
with former soccer player Yuuya Kizaki.

411
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:01,567
So after the show,
I'll guide them to the press interviews.

412
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,833
Please enjoy the show.

413
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,500
Editor-in-Chief Kawashima is
here from <i>Robe.</i>

414
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:08,900
What about Ms. Nagai?

415
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,967
She's not here yet.
This way, please.

416
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:13,233
NA-9 on the north side

417
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,967
will be <i>Robe</i> Editor-in-Chief
Erina Kawashima.

418
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:19,800
Seated next to her
will be designer Satoru Sasaki.

419
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,700
So the nine on that side
will be an editor too?

420
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,300
<i>Robe</i> and <i>Conscious</i> are rivals.

421
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,033
It's best to keep them apart.

422
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,800
The best seat in the house.

423
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:31,900
It's a beautiful runway.

424
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:35,233
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedule today.

425
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,400
Hello.

426
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,033
We meet again.

427
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,200
Mr. Sasaki,
how late did you stay last night?

428
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:43,667
-Excuse me.
-It's a secret.

429
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,833
Is it really okay?

430
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,267
This is such a nice seat.

431
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,567
Yes, Ms. Nanjo made sure of it.

432
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,200
It feels like a dream!

433
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,033
Mayu.

434
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,433
I'm glad you came.

435
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,567
This way.

436
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,100
Ms. Tokita.

437
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,433
Don't worry about us.

438
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,233
We'll wait in the lobby.
You can bring us in last.

439
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,733
Last?

440
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,433
You should have backup pieces.

441
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,133
Pieces?

442
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:24,900
Aya, let's go back to the lobby.

443
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't hyperventilate.

444
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,800
Boss!

445
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,067
Stand proud.

446
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
After all,

447
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,100
it's Designer Mizuki Nishizawa's show too.

448
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes.

449
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,133
She's got a good sixth sense.

450
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,300
-Is that your daughter?
-Yes.

451
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,767
Let's do it!

452
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,767
Yes!

453
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,667
You came.

454
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,000
Of course.

455
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:28,867
It's Emotion's show.

456
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Models are on standby.

457
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,300
It's time.

458
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,800
Fujimura is here.

459
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,533
Where's Fumika?

460
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,067
She's very busy right now.

461
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,400
My apologies.

462
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,800
She said to say hello.

463
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,300
I see.

464
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,767
Where's Fumi?

465
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,467
I see.

466
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:01,267
I wanted her to come.

467
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,433
This way please, Editor-in-Chief Inoue.

468
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,133
In seat SA-12 will be Editor-in-Chief
Inoue, from the fashion magazine

469
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,933
<i>Dolly Pink?</i>

470
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,400
It's a very casual
fashion magazine, right?

471
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,133
<i>Yes, it's geared toward young people.</i>

472
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,567
But they have a higher circulation
than <i>Conscious.</i>

473
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:28,133
I see <i>Dolly Pink</i> is fashionably late.

474
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,167
And yet they only cover cheap brands.

475
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:32,367
Stop it.

476
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,900
Well...

477
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,733
They've got sales, though.

478
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,767
They might have more influence than
the high fashion magazines these days.

479
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,067
Who said that?

480
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,600
Isn't it time yet?

481
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,933
We're on a tight schedule, you know?

482
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:54,800
They don't want to leave that seat empty.

483
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,900
Who else is coming?
<i>Conscious?</i>

484
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,900
Well...

485
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,000
Backup pieces...

486
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,500
Mrs. Ono, please watch your step.

487
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,100
This way, please.

488
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,833
Is she someone famous?

489
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
An actress?

490
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,967
Someone in the industry?

491
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:31,267
Watch your step.

492
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,333
Please.

493
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,067
Thank you.

494
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,867
It wouldn't have worked if it was me.

495
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,700
But with her...

496
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,233
I'm going to go sit.

497
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,900
<i>SA-9 has been filled.</i>

498
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:00,233
Okay.

499
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,967
Let's begin.

500
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,167
Am I too late?

501
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,833
<i>Hold on, Mr. Miki!</i>

502
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,833
-What's wrong?
<i>-Ms. Nagai is here.</i>

503
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,767
-Ms. Nagai, from <i>Conscious?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

504
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,300
But you just filled the seat.

505
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,033
This way, please.

506
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,333
Here?

507
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,567
Mr. Takeuchi.

508
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,867
I apologize,

509
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:44,367
but may I ask you to sit here?

510
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,933
All right.

511
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's fine with me.

512
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,967
And me?

513
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,800
This way, Ms. Nagai.

514
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:11,933
Hello.

515
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:15,867
I apologize,

516
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:19,833
but may I ask everyone
to move over by one seat?

517
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,667
Fumi's seat.

518
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:28,100
Sure. That seat is empty, so why not?

519
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Why don't you ask her to sit there?

520
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,967
What, you want this seat?

521
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,633
That's a little rude.

522
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,033
I'm very sorry.

523
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,700
We're deeply indebted to <i>Conscious</i>

524
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,533
for years of running articles
about our lingerie.

525
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,167
And so,

526
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:52,500
we'd really like for Ms. Nagai
to see the show from here.

527
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,400
Playing favorites, I see.

528
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,567
I apologize.

529
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,867
Can I ask you to move over by one seat?

530
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,300
Here we go.

531
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,767
That's fine.

532
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,233
It's just a seat.

533
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,533
Thank you so much.

534
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,933
Ms. Nagai, please have a seat.

535
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,533
Thank you.

536
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,133
Perfect.

537
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,000
Let's start.

538
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,267
Oh, no! What should I do?

539
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,100
It's time for my lessons.

540
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,767
Mayu, I'm so sorry.

541
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,767
I have my shamisen lesson.

542
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,967
What's happening?

543
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,067
What's going on?

544
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,933
She's a little off, isn't she?

545
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The exit.

546
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,333
Where's the exit?

547
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,400
Mrs. Ono.

548
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,367
If you must go, come this way.

549
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,467
I'll take you.

550
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,400
-I can do it.
-Please, take her seat.

551
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,333
I can't leave that seat empty.

552
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
I understand.

553
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,300
This way, please.

554
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,767
It's like playing musical chairs.

555
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,667
That's all because someone arrived late.

556
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:32,933
That's true.

557
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,533
Mrs. Ono,

558
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,367
thank you so much for coming.

559
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,767
Just knowing you came by

560
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,000
makes me happy.

561
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,067
See you soon.

562
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Yes.

563
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:49,767
Let's start!

564
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,067
Lights, stand by.

565
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,133
Okay.

566
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,600
Okay, ready.

567
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,667
<i>Models ready?</i>

568
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,100
Ready?

569
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,467
-Go!
-Go.

570
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:29,633
Second round, please change quickly!

571
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,067
Double-check order and styling!

572
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:50,733
We'll do a final check here.

573
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,133
Please, come here.

574
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Thank you.

575
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,067
Are you okay?

576
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,333
-Can you walk?
-I can do it!

577
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:03,867
Turn around.

578
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,833
Please.

579
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:19,500
Go ahead.

580
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,233
Em is next.

581
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:50,333
Today,

582
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,500
it's finally your debut, Mizuki.

583
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,833
Yes!

584
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,167
Excuse me.

585
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:05,400
Can I still get into the show?

586
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:08,167
Sure, if you have an invitation.

587
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:23,467
Turn around.

588
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:26,400
Okay.

589
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:27,767
Go get 'em.

590
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,667
Em is looking good.

591
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,333
Yes.

592
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:14,433
Can I ask you to take over for a second?

593
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:16,133
Stand by for the finale.

594
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
Come this way.

595
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,600
Come on.

596
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,467
Come on, come on.

597
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:30,533
Come on!

598
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,767
Please, stand by!

599
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,500
I...

600
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:47,700
What's wrong?

601
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,067
Ms. Kaoru, please.

602
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,200
Tonight...

603
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:01,733
you're not being professional.

604
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,100
Ms. Kaoru,

605
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,833
this is as far as you'll go!

606
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,133
I...

607
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,767
will do whatever I have to

608
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:22,967
for the show to be as perfect as possible.

609
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:24,033
That's all.

610
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,567
Your feelings are not important!

611
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:53,333
But, we don't have a model.

612
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,267
I leave it to you.

613
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,900
Sari Machida?

614
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:47,300
Bravo!

615
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:49,067
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
