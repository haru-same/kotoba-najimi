1
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:32,100
Tokyo has everything.

2
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,733
I know! I never imagined

3
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,100
I'd be eating sanzokuyaki in Ginza.

4
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,900
Apparently, I'm too unsophisticated.

5
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,367
It's impossible
for someone to work in Ginza,

6
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,900
unless that someone is you.

7
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,133
Stop being biased towards rich people.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,367
It's Dad's money.

9
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,300
You know what?

10
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,900
Don't listen to your boss.

11
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,100
You're not poor and unsophisticated.

12
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,167
You eat three meals a day.

13
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:59,200
You have a place to live.

14
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,200
Your clothes might show you lack taste,

15
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:04,467
but at least you're wearing them.

16
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,900
Taste. I hate that word.

17
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,467
What do you mean?

18
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:10,367
If you're buying the same cheap thing,

19
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,500
it makes a huge difference!

20
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,700
It's a matter of taste.

21
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:18,167
Will you stop emphasizing "taste"?

22
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:19,633
I'm not!

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,033
And besides, I mean "taste in fashion."

24
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:28,400
When I become a wedding planner,

25
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:31,967
I'll plan yours,
and it'll be tasteful and amazing!

26
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,333
You're being too loud.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,033
You'd better get used to it.

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,500
Me? I have my phone in one hand

29
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:05,600
and a bra in the other.

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,400
I can go outside like this.

31
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,733
I, I can too!

32
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,100
Mr. Fujimura!

33
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,033
I was just about to come and get you.

34
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,333
Thank you for meeting me.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
{\an8}2015 STORE EXPANSION AND PRODUCT PLACEMENT

36
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,167
{\an8}Mr. Fujimura, we can't mass produce.

37
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,767
We only do custom made garments.

38
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,033
Yes, I completely understand.

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,133
Is there a way we can work around it?

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,233
You know how Ms. Nanjo is.

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,733
That's why I'm asking you.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,967
Mr. Fujimura.

43
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,533
May I join the conversation?

44
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,867
Well... I should be going now.

45
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,367
"He that would the daughter win,
must with the mother first begin."

46
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:03,667
We plan to win you over soon enough.

47
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,333
Our motto is to provide all customers,

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,967
from all walks of life,
with quality products.

49
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,567
What a wonderful motto.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Excuse me for saying this,
President Nanjo.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,500
You...

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,133
only deal with customers

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,867
that can afford to walk through
that fancy door.

54
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,467
There aren't many people in Yamagata

55
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,867
who can afford to walk through that door.

56
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,633
Don't you think that's unfair?

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,933
He was from Vanderbilt's Tokyo.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Wouldn't it be great
to have our products there?

59
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,767
The boss believes in
doing things custom made.

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,467
But even haute couture

61
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,967
has the option of prêt-à-porter.

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,967
Pru... Pre?

63
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,133
Prêt-à-porter.

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,100
High end, ready-to-wear.

65
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,867
Clothing stores in Ginza

66
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,667
generally all carry prêt-à-porter.

67
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,533
Prataporte, prataporte.

68
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:21,033
Did Pierre Cardin coin the term?

69
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,667
Everyone switched to ready-made

70
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,733
because they realized custom made

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,767
didn't make for very good business.

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,033
But top brands like Dior and Chanel

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,333
all began as custom tailors, right?

74
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,400
We should have more pride.

75
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,633
Well, that's true but...

76
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,233
Ladies.

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,133
We have three more clients today.

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,433
Get back to work!

79
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:50,000
Reiko has so much energy.

80
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm so exhausted already.

81
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:56,133
The trunk show did really well this time.

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,700
But there are so many orders!

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,433
I have to take the last train every night!

84
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,567
That's wonderful.

85
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,533
It means we have a lot of customers.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,167
Speaking of customers,

87
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:14,333
Fumi, don't we have to
work on Mrs. Hashimoto's pattern?

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes, we do!

89
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,667
Yes.

90
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,767
Boss! Please give me a project too!

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,100
But not getting coffee, running errands,
or stocking up.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,333
Something more like

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
working directly with the customers?

94
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,967
You can stand still.

95
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,900
I have no time to be teaching you.

96
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,067
Welcome, Ms. Kondou.

97
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,433
We've been expecting you.

98
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,267
Do you have a specific outfit in mind?

99
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,433
If it's a dress, we can design it
with a low neckline.

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,800
Yes, I do have a dress in mind.

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,333
Let's start by taking the measurements.

102
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,133
Then, we can discuss the details.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm so sorry.

104
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:20,600
It's a little warm in there.
Let's air it out.

105
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,767
It'll be ready in five minutes.

106
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,767
-Please, bring the tea menu.
-Sure.

107
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,033
Boss, I can bring the tea.

108
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,500
I have the perfect job for you.

109
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,867
Did you know that dust
is mostly made up of fiber?

110
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,367
Your favorite.

111
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,900
You get to collect it.
Isn't that wonderful?

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,233
Yes!

113
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,400
The final design is ready!

114
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,367
Here you go.

115
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:08,767
Here it is.

116
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,200
An irregular pattern!

117
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,167
Casablanca.

118
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:01,900
Do we have it in stock?

119
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,633
It's perfectly organized.

120
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,367
It's the only thing I could do.

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm so sorry.

122
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,133
We're swamped with orders.

123
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,133
I'll teach you once things settle down.

124
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,733
Okay.

125
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,367
The light beige fabric won't come in

126
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,133
until the day after tomorrow.

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,933
I'll go pick it up tomorrow night,
so tell them to make it happen.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,300
Sure thing.

129
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,600
Am I that messy?

130
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,200
Please take a look.

131
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Thank you.

132
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,700
You're like Cinderella.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,567
You're making me feel bad for you.

134
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,067
Don't worry about me.

135
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,533
Dust is mostly fiber, you know?

136
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,733
If you love fiber,
you have to take care of it.

137
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,333
It shouldn't stay in the corner of a room
with the rest of the dust.

138
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,533
That's way too sad.

139
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,100
That's taking it a little too far.

140
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:45,533
Why do you love it so much?

141
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,233
It's going to be a long story.

142
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,267
I'd appreciate a condensed version.

143
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,667
I'm from Nagano.

144
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,600
My father worked for
a company that made silk.

145
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,300
As a child, I was impressed
by the cocoons of thread.

146
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,600
I fell in love with the final fabric.

147
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,067
That's how it all started.

148
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,733
I left out the most important part!

149
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
Do you mind if I go on?

150
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,367
Go ahead.

151
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,267
The "Mayu" part of my name...

152
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,633
<i>comes from the "Mayu" meaning cocoon.</i>

153
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,033
I see.

154
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,700
-That explains your love of fiber.
-Yes.

155
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,000
If you love beautiful threads...

156
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,967
then you're in the right field.

157
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:33,533
Even if you're Cinderella now.

158
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,133
Not to worry.

159
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,667
Because cleaning and organizing...

160
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,700
I love it.

161
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Let me tell you--

162
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,167
Next time!

163
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,700
-Yes?
-That.

164
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,900
That's so cool.

165
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,267
What?

166
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,900
This? Is it?

167
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:16,633
Is it very difficult to measure the bust?

168
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:18,700
Yes, it's difficult.

169
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,900
It should require national certification.

170
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,667
National certification?

171
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,333
Doctors, hair stylists...

172
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:32,300
jobs in which you touch another person

173
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,433
require national certification.

174
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Yes.

175
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,333
To have access to a person's body,

176
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,633
as well as information
pertaining to their body,

177
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,467
is no small matter.

178
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,067
So it requires certification.

179
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,800
Customers can therefore
have some peace of mind.

180
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,367
You're right.

181
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,833
Being a lingerie consultant

182
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,300
is a job that also requires
skill and training.

183
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:53,767
Reiko.

184
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,867
What is it?

185
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,933
Never stand directly
in front of a customer.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,100
It could make her feel uncomfortable.

187
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,600
Stand a step off to the side.

188
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:09,733
As for the measuring tape, the zero
should be on your left, kept short.

189
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,267
The tape should never touch the floor.

190
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,933
You're going to use it on your customer.

191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,367
First, start with the bust.

192
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:21,200
Bring the tape around the back
and slide it.

193
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,067
You need to measure
the highest point of the bust.

194
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,067
Next, the lower bust.

195
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,200
For the waist...

196
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,667
the area between the hip bone and ribs.

197
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,700
And finally, the hips.

198
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:41,200
Meanwhile, subtly check
the hip bones and bust.

199
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,800
Keep touching to a minimum.

200
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:47,667
Our boss can instantly get a feel for
a customer's body shape.

201
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:51,533
Lines and curves.
Those can't be expressed in numbers.

202
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,767
Here.

203
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,900
You can only learn from experience.

204
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Experience.

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,467
It's finally becoming interesting.

206
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,967
But they won't let me do anything yet.

207
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,600
That's too bad.

208
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,267
The Black Velvet.

209
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,733
It's ready, so I'll put it here.

210
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Thank you.

211
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,067
Coffee for the boss.

212
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,567
This is all she drinks.

213
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,767
It's so comforting here.

214
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,733
Grandfathers used to hang out
in places like this back home, right?

215
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,167
And it would turn into
a karaoke bar at night.

216
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,667
This is how we set up after 10:00 p.m.

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Welcome.

218
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,100
So, what's the news?

219
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,133
So tomorrow, I get to help
shop for a bride's dress.

220
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,933
And next month,
I get to do it all on my own.

221
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,600
-Already?
-Yes!

222
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:12,267
The company wants the newbies
to learn from experience.

223
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,000
Experience?

224
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:19,133
But it's overwhelming to suddenly
have so much responsibility.

225
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,133
I haven't learned anything yet.

226
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,367
You're so lucky.
Experience.

227
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,400
You want me to hold down the fort

228
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:31,733
on my own?

229
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,033
Don't worry.

230
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,167
We have no appointments
scheduled for today.

231
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,667
There shouldn't be anyone coming in.

232
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,233
But if anyone does comes in,

233
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
just call me and I'll come right over.

234
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,500
Got it?

235
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,633
Understood.

236
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,400
Here.

237
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,400
The key to the shop.

238
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,233
For you.

239
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
For me?

240
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,467
My own key.

241
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:06,767
It's here!

242
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,667
The dress from the new line.

243
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,500
It's the design you wanted.

244
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,400
I'll bring it to the church right away!

245
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,667
I'll make sure it's there on time!

246
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,067
It's so empty.

247
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm so bored!

248
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,367
Welcome...

249
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:37,433
Do you... Do you have an appointment?

250
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,100
No... it's my first time here.

251
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,233
Really?

252
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,133
Please, feel free to look around.

253
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
I'll get my manager.

254
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,433
Reiko.

255
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,800
Reiko.

256
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,600
Excuse me.

257
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,233
Do I just choose something from here?

258
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,233
Well... That...

259
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,467
That section is not for sale.

260
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,633
Can you help me?

261
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,233
Of course.

262
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,467
What are you looking for?

263
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,767
A bra and panties set.

264
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,667
Did you have a specific outfit in mind?

265
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
If...

266
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,367
If it's a dress, we can design it
with a low neckline.

267
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:34,633
No, I was just curious about
trying something from this store.

268
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,433
Do you take measurements?

269
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,333
Yes!

270
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,200
And please, try on the sample.

271
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,533
You'll feel the difference.

272
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,133
It's so spacious.

273
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,533
Thank you.

274
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,200
If you'll excuse me.

275
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:03,367
Do you have a specific color in mind?

276
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,500
Are there any particular concerns
with your normal wear?

277
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,833
Changes you wish for?

278
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,233
Please, take a look.

279
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:17,067
We can start with these.

280
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,467
TOTAL: 105,840 yen

281
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,667
I guess I'll go with that.

282
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:30,233
-Great! Then we'll proceed with this.
-All right...

283
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,967
That's an unusual lace.

284
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,200
Is it organza?

285
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,967
And the lace, it's very detailed.

286
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:50,200
It was left over from when
I made my daughter's costume.

287
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,600
She takes ballet nearby.

288
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Goodbye.

289
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank you.

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
See you again soon.

291
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,633
I got an order from a new customer!

292
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,433
You helped the customer on your own?

293
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,733
I told you to call me if anyone came in.

294
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,967
It wasn't a problem.

295
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,933
I took her measurements,

296
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
fitted her with samples.

297
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,700
Measurements?
But you never...

298
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,433
Reiko taught me.

299
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,667
What kind of person was she?

300
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,100
It was someone who already had an interest

301
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,833
in trying out Emotion Lingerie.

302
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,367
This is a pretty expensive order.

303
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,633
She ordered this from the trunk show.

304
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,733
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

305
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,033
Yuri, it's Mayuko.

306
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,667
How did it go today?

307
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:07,933
You were right,
one learns from experience.

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,133
It's the best kind of training.

309
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,233
I wish someone would let me
measure their bust.

310
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,167
Here you go.

311
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,933
Why don't you go and have some?

312
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,767
Please.

313
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,967
I know it's a very strange request.

314
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:49,500
But I really want to review
what I learned today.

315
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:56,933
This was no problem.
I wanted to have some anyway.

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,967
I know it sounds crazy

317
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,300
to have a complete stranger

318
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,300
ask to take your bust measurements.

319
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,567
I'm fine with it.

320
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:07,900
What?

321
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,733
I mean, we are both women.

322
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,233
This is totally normal for work.

323
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,533
But I just ate,
so don't pay attention to my stomach.

324
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,767
The food was so good.

325
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,433
Wait... Wait a second!

326
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,967
I want to start from the beginning.

327
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,033
So, you can walk in through that door.

328
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Is there something wrong?

329
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,567
Beautiful.

330
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,200
It's like we're different species.

331
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,033
The human body is so interesting!

332
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,667
Especially women's breasts.

333
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,600
It's such a complex and strange shape!

334
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,533
And yet, it's so beautiful...

335
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,267
that we can make something
that fits this form so perfectly.

336
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,133
Fabric is so amazing!

337
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
No, thread is amazing!

338
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,300
Fiber is wonderful!

339
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,667
You're very strange, Ms. Tokita.

340
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,333
We finally overcame this hurdle.

341
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,800
We got through all of our orders for now.

342
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,033
This round was really rough.

343
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,233
Thanks for your help with the trunk show.

344
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,133
That's my line.

345
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,167
It was your chance to shine.

346
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,367
Don't worry about it!

347
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:43,900
Emotion is Emotion

348
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:47,300
because of Mayumi Nanjo's designs.

349
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,533
Is it?

350
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:55,400
You can only do so much on your own.

351
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,700
Ideas, talent...

352
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,133
If it all depended on only one person,

353
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,900
wouldn't it just run dry someday?

354
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:07,633
That's what I really like about you, Fumi.

355
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,400
What do you mean?

356
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,200
From the way you look,

357
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,667
one wouldn't expect you
to speak so frankly.

358
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,767
What do you mean, from the way I look?

359
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,667
I mean you look so cute.

360
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,700
But really, it's people like you
who can overturn tradition.

361
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:33,000
Sounds like quite a feat.

362
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:42,600
How about if we use this kind of fabric.

363
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,533
If you can't see the form
at the pattern stage...

364
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,500
You have to apply the actual fabric.

365
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,367
Of course, but it still needs work.

366
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:53,000
You're acting differently from yesterday.

367
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,967
That was yesterday.
Today is today.

368
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,267
We're at work.

369
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:02,100
This is Emotion.

370
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:06,600
Thank you for yesterday!

371
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,100
Yes?

372
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:10,667
What?

373
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,300
Yesterday's customer
wants to cancel her order.

374
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,433
I see.

375
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
I tried to ask her why,

376
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,067
but she just apologized--

377
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,467
The reason is simple.

378
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,433
She couldn't trust you.

379
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:34,833
Have you tried on any of our products?

380
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:40,233
-No.
-Then, how could you recommend it?

381
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,100
Your insensitivity is so impressive,

382
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,467
it makes me angry.

383
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,300
I'm sorry.

384
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:52,400
Listen.

385
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,900
In order to satisfy a customer's needs...

386
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,900
you need experience, not heart.

387
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:01,033
You need skills
learned through accomplishment.

388
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,100
For that, the customer gives us
their money and their trust.

389
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:09,167
What can you offer
that's worth their money and their trust?

390
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,300
I'm sorry.

391
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,867
It's my fault.

392
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,133
I gave her an incomplete lesson.

393
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,367
That's exactly right.

394
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,567
However...

395
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:26,600
if you had the sincere desire to serve

396
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:28,967
the customer when she came in,

397
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,067
she would have certainly

398
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,033
talked to you on the phone.

399
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,033
We could have had a long relationship.

400
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,333
Emotion has now lost
an important customer.

401
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,133
Thanks to you.

402
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,833
She will never...

403
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,733
walk through our door again.

404
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,600
YURI CALLING

405
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:25,533
The dress was one
the bride had been looking for.

406
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,567
When I found out there was one left,

407
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,933
I promised I would get it for her in time.

408
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,667
Mayu, are you listening?

409
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:37,167
Sorry.

410
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:38,700
I found the dress,

411
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,633
and brought it to her in time.

412
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,333
I'm so sorry.

413
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,133
<i>But the size didn't fit.</i>

414
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,133
Why didn't you tell somebody?

415
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,300
<i>Of course, I had checked first.</i>

416
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:54,733
But that brand of dress was made tight.

417
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,633
And the bride was a little chubby.

418
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Everyone else already knew that

419
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:03,900
and told her the dress was sold out.

420
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:06,133
Out of consideration for her.

421
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:10,833
I thought I was doing the bride a favor.

422
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:14,733
But a newbie like me with no skills

423
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,400
shouldn't have butt in.

424
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:20,433
Skills.

425
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,667
That's true.

426
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,933
We made the same mistake on the same day.

427
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,567
We must be close.

428
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,733
It's not the same.

429
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:37,900
Your mistake is better.

430
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,633
A better mistake? Is there such a thing?

431
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,033
You were thinking about your customer.

432
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:48,267
Well, yes.

433
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,033
But I wasn't.

434
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,333
At all.

435
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:07,867
Excuse me.

436
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,567
I'd like to call that customer.

437
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,333
Absolutely not.

438
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,467
A phone call would be rude.

439
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,467
Then, I'll go to her home.

440
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,933
Her address should be on the form.

441
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,733
She didn't fill in her address.

442
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,833
Ms. Tokita.

443
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,567
Do you even remember her name?

444
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,500
I'll tell you her name.

445
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,600
It's Hiromi Tsukamoto.

446
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,467
Hiromi Tsukamoto.

447
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,700
Thank you very much.

448
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,133
Didn't she mention
a particular train station or something?

449
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,900
Lace.

450
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,633
<i>That's an unusual lace.</i>

451
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,433
<i>It was left over from when</i>
<i>I made my daughter's costume.</i>

452
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,267
<i>She takes ballet nearby.</i>

453
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,333
Ballet!

454
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,900
Ballet class.

455
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,533
Ballet.

456
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,467
{\an8}Here it is!

457
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:18,533
{\an8}KISHIKAWA DANCE SCHOOL
JUNIOR CLASSES – WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY

458
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,200
Look at me! Look.

459
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,900
So cute!

460
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,900
-Bye!
-See you later! Have fun!

461
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
Hello, it's very warm today.

462
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,667
We'll see you later.

463
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,933
Mrs. Tsukamoto!

464
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,433
I'm...

465
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,333
I know... From Emotion.

466
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,567
I'm sorry I canceled my order.

467
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:56,633
I'm so sorry!

468
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,933
I entirely misunderstood

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,833
what's most important

470
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,633
in meeting a customer's needs!

471
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,100
Excuse me.

472
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,733
I'm glad you finally came in.

473
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:24,733
You always stop and look at
our window display.

474
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,733
Yes.

475
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,967
I always pass by
when I go pick up my daughter.

476
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:33,400
And the trunk show the other day.

477
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,567
-What?
-I saw you there as well.

478
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:41,433
You remember me?

479
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:45,900
We'd been waiting
for you to come into the store.

480
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,233
I didn't have the courage.

481
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
But...

482
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,100
you took the leap, and came in.

483
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,800
And yet,

484
00:30:55,867 --> 00:31:01,800
we weren't properly prepared
to receive you.

485
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,567
We sincerely apologize.

486
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,433
Please.

487
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,167
We'd like to try serving you again.

488
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,767
No.

489
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,267
I'm sorry, but no thank you.

490
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:20,800
I came here today...

491
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,767
to apologize for canceling.

492
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,933
Emotion Lingerie is too beautiful,

493
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,700
and too luxurious.

494
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:32,133
It wouldn't suit someone like me.

495
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,333
I actually laughed when I tried it on.

496
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,733
I thought, "What am I doing
in such a fancy lingerie store?"

497
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,100
It felt a little uncomfortable.

498
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,900
A housewife like me
should stick to what's comfortable.

499
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:46,033
So, please.

500
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:51,933
I'm sorry!

501
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,633
The truth is.

502
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,233
It's too expensive.

503
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,600
TOTAL: 105,840 yen

504
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,833
Will you give us...

505
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,067
another chance?

506
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,167
Excuse me.

507
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Thank you.

508
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,533
Excuse me.

509
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,800
We don't want to compromise on quality.

510
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:53,967
And we use the best craftspeople.

511
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,933
So the price will reflect that.

512
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,033
No matter how much
we try to keep costs down,

513
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,000
the price...

514
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,500
will be something like this.

515
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,767
TOTAL: 43,200 yen

516
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,033
But this is less than half
of the original price.

517
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,300
Isn't it too cheap?

518
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,500
Not at all.

519
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,933
With this price,

520
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
you'd be able to buy four high end
sets of lingerie at a department store.

521
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,433
I always buy mine at the local store.

522
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,967
How much do you usually spend on lingerie?

524
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:34,900
I know the question is terribly rude.

525
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,200
But would you tell us?

526
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,900
About 2,500 yen.

527
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,567
That's about how much I spend too.

528
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,300
I understand.

529
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,933
TOTAL: 2,500 yen

530
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,800
Let's do this for today.

531
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:00,133
What? You couldn't possibly...

532
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,933
It's fine if it's a little bit at a time.
Whenever you can.

533
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,867
How many times would it be?

534
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:09,267
Let's see.

535
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,400
Divided by 2,500 yen.

536
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,467
I'm so bad with numbers.

537
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,267
About 17 to 18 times.

538
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,233
Let's do 17 installments.

539
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,267
Whenever you stop in is fine.

540
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,067
We won't come chasing after you

541
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,033
every time you pass by the store.

542
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,067
Please, stop in again on the way

543
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,633
to your daughter's ballet class.

544
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:46,000
-But--
-I really want for you to wear this.

545
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:51,433
You fell in love with our product.

546
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And so...

547
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,667
{\an8}this is fine for today.

548
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,167
I look forward to
seeing the finished product.

549
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,300
It's very unusual
for the boss to make it entirely herself.

550
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,467
It's like I have a whole new body.

551
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,000
You look so pretty, Mommy.

552
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,400
I want one too!

553
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,767
When you're older.

554
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,167
Promise?

555
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,800
Please, don't ever say,

556
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:20,967
"It wouldn't suit someone like me."

557
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:26,067
I sincerely hope that one day

558
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:32,500
you'll come back for our garments
with more confidence.

559
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,033
Yes.

560
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:39,867
I think I wanted the confidence...

561
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:46,233
to return to work after maternity leave.

562
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,700
But I didn't have it.

563
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,400
If I could become the kind of woman
who wears Emotion Lingerie,

564
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,133
it would make me happy.

565
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:14,167
What made you go through the trouble?

566
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,767
Trouble?

567
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,067
You made everything from scratch yourself.

568
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,200
And for such a low price.

569
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,833
She made me remember something.

570
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
What was it?

571
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,167
Long ago, I...

572
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
You?

573
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,733
I'm not going to tell you.

574
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:58,900
What is it?

575
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:39,267
So pretty.

576
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:52,833
Saruhashi!

577
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,200
Hello?

578
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,067
2015 STORE EXPANSION AND PRODUCT PLACEMENT

579
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:00,767
What was his name,
the man from Vanderbilt's Tokyo?

580
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:03,967
You know, that guy with the slick hair.

581
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,767
The unpleasant guy with glasses.

582
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,033
Mr. Fujimura?

583
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,533
I'd like to speak with him.

584
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:12,967
Why is that?

585
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,700
Because I want to.

586
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,567
Do you mind?

587
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:22,600
Your prize.

588
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,067
Is this for me?

589
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,167
It's for cleaning.

590
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,667
What's the size?

591
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:33,500
Oh my!

592
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,767
Will I turn into a D-cup if I wear this?

593
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,167
-Don't be silly!
-Silly?

594
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,167
Big doesn't mean better.

595
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:43,000
That's one of my best works.

596
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,500
Everything you want to know is there.

597
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,733
As well as the job you want.

598
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:53,967
Job?

599
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,200
Use it as you like.

600
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,367
Motif.

601
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,700
Strap.

602
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:23,967
Side belt.

603
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,600
This is a satin net!

604
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,333
Is this urethane foam?

605
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:10,267
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
