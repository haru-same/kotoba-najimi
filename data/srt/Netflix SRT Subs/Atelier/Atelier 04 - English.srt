1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,800
3 MONTHS LATER

2
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,533
Can we go with 20 inch increments?

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,767
Yes, it's cheaper that way.

4
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,100
All right, I'll go and confirm
the colors now.

5
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,267
Okay.

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,567
Thank you.

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,533
All right.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Hot.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,933
Tokyo, hot!

10
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,933
{\an8}We're proud to introduce
our new collaboration line.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,333
LAUNCH OF EMOTION'S SECOND LINE

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,033
Em by Emotion. Samples are now finalized.

13
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:12,067
Mizuki Nishizawa is our designer.

14
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:16,233
She's worked under chief designer
Mayumi Nanjo for the past eight years,

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,067
and has been entrusted with this project.

16
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:22,167
Please, take a look at the products.

17
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:25,567
We've used an abundance of detailed lace

18
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:28,200
in order to give it a glamorous look.

19
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:31,200
Each color scheme
creates a different feel,

20
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:34,033
so you have different options,
depending on your mood.

21
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,800
Thank you very much.

22
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,833
Em by Emotion targets

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,900
20- and 30-year-olds
who want to add luxury into their lives.

24
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:53,967
We would like to create products
that reflect this desire.

25
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:00,433
We are now passing around
promotional photos.

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
-No, it's these ones.
-I'm sorry.

27
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:07,267
The concept was called,
"Meeting a beautiful you."

28
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,367
Emotion is custom-made for the...

29
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,900
Excuse me, Ms. Ida,

30
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,267
will you stand here for a moment?

31
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,533
But Mizuki should be the one who...

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,100
Don't worry, this is just for
an internal presentation.

33
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,700
All right, then.

34
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,733
It looks good.
You're very photogenic.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
We can probably use this as is.

36
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,967
That's too flattering, Mr. Fujimura.

37
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,100
The image of the designer is important.

38
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:44,433
It would be wonderful if President Nanjo
could be the face of Em.

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,933
But Em is factory made, not handmade.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Nanjo's very specific about that.

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,733
She's a stubborn, old shopkeeper.

42
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:09,767
Shall we make this one more decorative?

43
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes!

44
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,567
How about this for lace and ribbons?

45
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,600
I apologize for being so difficult.

46
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,400
I love challenges.

47
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:24,600
I'd love to add a cute charm here.

48
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,167
Let's see.

49
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:27,733
Excuse me.

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,167
I'd like to show something to Ms. Hayashi.

51
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:36,333
That is too cute!

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,500
These other ones are cute too!

53
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,567
It's exactly what I was looking for!

54
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,033
Excuse me.

55
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,167
Here are the parts for Ms. Hayashi.

56
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,900
Leave them there, please.

57
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,033
Of course.

58
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you all right, boss?

59
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,600
It can't be helped.

60
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,733
Mizuki and Fumi aren't here,

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,200
and I made the mistake
of having you fill in on your own.

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,167
I only have myself to blame.

63
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,933
I apologize.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,533
However...

65
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:26,433
you did a good job with the charms.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,000
That's exactly the kind of response

67
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,600
that customers appreciate.

68
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,433
Is that an actual compliment?

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,733
Take it as you will.

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,400
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,233
But...

72
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,867
Wasn't there an important presentation

73
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:52,467
over at Vanderbilt's?

74
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,533
What?

75
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,333
Are you worried about that?

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,367
No.

77
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:03,067
I was just wondering
if you didn't need to be there?

78
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,500
What?

79
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,700
-Hey.
-Yes?

80
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:16,267
These numbers haven't been corrected yet.

81
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,333
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,733
And the wording here is
totally misleading.

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,933
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
Fumi.

85
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,233
Aren't you getting a little too friendly
with Mr. Fujimura?

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,600
Please, keep your head on straight.

87
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,000
Mizuki!

88
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,300
Everything's going well.
You don't have to worry.

89
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:49,833
Worry about what?

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,533
Well, you seem a little stressed.

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Of course I am.

92
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:58,033
We were only supposed to
start with three series.

93
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,933
But Mr. Fujimura spoke with Fumi,

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,067
and now suddenly, there's five.

95
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:06,033
The designs, the materials.
I had to do all the work.

96
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,000
It was only possible thanks to you.

97
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,233
Don't placate me.

98
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
You think that makes me happy?

99
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,900
In any case, Fumi needs to cool off.

100
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,567
Fujimura is too slick with his words.

101
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,867
If we listen to him,
Em's going to run into problems.

102
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:23,967
Oh, my.

103
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,033
What?

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,233
I thought the pressure was getting to you,
but you're completely clearheaded.

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,633
EMOTION'S SECOND LINE

106
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,067
{\an8}EMOTION TEAM
BOSS - REIKO - MAYU

107
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,067
EM BY EMOTION TEAM
MIZUKI - FUMIKA - SARUHASHI - HIME

108
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,800
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

109
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,700
It's been lonely around here, hasn't it?

110
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,367
It's almost time to launch Em.

111
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:23,367
What do you mean? You guys have me!

112
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,900
-You're looking good as always, Mayu.
-Here!

113
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,900
Work hard, intern.

114
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:32,967
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,533
What was the boss thinking?

116
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,933
Hiring a part-time worker like that.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,333
What kind of college senior says
they don't need to look for a job?

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,533
I wonder if the boss
is really doing all right?

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,367
She's working on all the orders herself.

120
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,533
Her pride keeps her working.

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,833
Yes, that's true.

122
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,500
Are you feeling a little left behind?

123
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,200
Of course not!

124
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,333
I don't feel that way at all.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,967
Please!

126
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,067
I'd like to be involved with Em too!

127
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,200
I knew you'd ask.

128
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,933
I'll continue to get fabric and parts

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,467
so that it doesn't affect your work.

130
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,100
-So, please...
-No.

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,900
I want to see firsthand
the process of starting a new line.

132
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,300
I want to learn.

133
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,800
You.

134
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,133
Do you think that selling
to a hundred customers

135
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,400
is more important than helping
that single customer in front of you?

136
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
No.

137
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,433
You can't compare them.

138
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,133
They're completely different things.

139
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,100
That's correct.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,833
Well...

141
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,833
you've grown into an Emotion employee.

142
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,633
Please, don't make fun of me.

143
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,333
But, you're attracted to large numbers.

144
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,033
Well...

145
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,967
Working with a lot of people,

146
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,733
creating something that could make
many people happy,

147
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,333
did sound a little interesting.

148
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
That's also correct.

149
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,300
But right now, it's important to endure.

150
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,467
Endure?

151
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,400
Good evening.
Were you looking for something?

152
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:49,567
You're still here.

153
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,500
I was looking for the Fujix catalog.

154
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,067
Oh, that.

155
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,367
-Here.
-Thank you.

156
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,167
-What's this?
-That's...

157
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,067
Just for me. So I can practice.

158
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,500
You were studying.

159
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:20,700
I didn't go to fashion school,
so I don't have very much knowledge.

160
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,200
Design, patterns, sewing.

161
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,100
There's so much I have to learn.

162
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,067
That's bad.

163
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:30,667
I know.

164
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
No, no! I meant me!

165
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,700
What?

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,700
The boss would be impressed with you.

167
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,400
No, she would just be very sarcastic.
It wouldn't mean much to her.

168
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,433
Well, the boss is a perfectionist.

169
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:50,400
But...

170
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,233
has the boss

171
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,033
made any mistakes in the past?

172
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:58,900
Why do you ask?

173
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:03,433
She said something about enduring.

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,933
It's nothing. Never mind.

175
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,833
EM BY EMOTION

176
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,367
The presentation went well.

177
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:45,567
I've been asked why we don't produce
on a larger scale.

178
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,733
I mean, 100 units per series

179
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,767
is such a small number
from our standpoint.

180
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,733
It's nice to be praised.

181
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,667
This is just in theory, of course,

182
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:59,000
but have you considered
nationwide production?

183
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:02,467
We'd cover the initial costs.

184
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:05,433
You could make 1,000 units per series.

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,900
That would be a hit for sure.

186
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,167
So, 5,000 for five series?

187
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,867
Nanjo would never approve.

188
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,533
Production is already underway.

189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,967
Why settle for such a small scale?

190
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,767
In business, that's unthinkable.

191
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,833
Let's stop.

192
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,467
I mean, it's no different
from your small store, then.

193
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:28,367
Em by Emotion is a wonderful product.

194
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:32,033
I can proudly push the product
to our customers nationwide.

195
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:38,333
You can even start your own brand.

196
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,167
Thank you for your kind words,

197
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,300
but it's not very realistic.

198
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,867
You're so lucky.

199
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,900
I wish someone would tell me that.

200
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,067
Fumi.

201
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,167
You have an aura about you, Ms. Ida.

202
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:57,600
You can easily become a fashion icon.

203
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,667
Well, that was smooth!

204
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,833
Yes, I'm impressed.

205
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,300
Did I lay it on too thick?

206
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,933
You told the boss you wanted
to work with Em too?

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Mayu!

208
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,733
I'm not unsatisfied with my current job.

209
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,000
But there's so little I can do here.

210
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,467
It kind of makes me feel bad.

211
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:33,600
The boss is able to do everything herself.

212
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,133
It's the same for me.

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,500
Mr. Saruhashi does just fine without me.

214
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,867
I shouldn't complain!

215
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,633
I just need to do what I can.

216
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,500
Yes.

217
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:55,200
I tried this at the market,
and it was delicious.

218
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,767
You can have it.

219
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,800
It looks so good, but I can't.

220
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,200
Here, I got it.

221
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,067
Right?

222
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,067
Oh, my.

223
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,533
-You're so friendly with each other.
-How nice.

224
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,067
It's not like that!

225
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,933
Yeah, they're not like that!

226
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,667
About the October trunk show.

227
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,433
I'd like you two to produce it.

228
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,033
That'll be a challenge.

229
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,967
Did something happen, boss?

230
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,800
It's a matter of logistics.

231
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:45,767
My hands are full just filling the orders.

232
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,967
And so--

233
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,000
If you had to plan the show as well,
it would be too much, boss.

234
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,633
Unfortunately, I'm not young anymore.

235
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,567
Fumi and Mizuki can come back
once things at Em have settled down.

236
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm so sorry we can't help now.

237
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,500
Don't worry, I know.

238
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,100
That's why, this time,

239
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,567
I'd like for you both to work on the show.

240
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,100
That's a great idea.

241
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,400
You have to challenge the young, right?

242
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,467
-What about me?
-You, be quiet!

243
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,467
It might be a nice change of pace.

244
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,067
So, it's decided!

245
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,000
Of course, I'll decide on the theme.

246
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:23,567
Your first job will be to gather material.

247
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:27,733
Find ideas to inspire my creative juices,

248
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,567
and write a proposal for me.

249
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,367
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:33,533
Good luck!

251
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,267
Yes!

252
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:48,267
EMOTION TRUNK SHOW
MAYU - HIME

253
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:52,233
These are the past spring
and summer lineups.

254
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,000
An encounter.

255
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,567
<i>La Primavera</i> by Botticelli.

256
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
{\an8}Resort.

257
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,900
Van Gogh's <i>Sunflowers?</i>

258
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,333
Should we go with an art theme, then?

259
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,900
Perhaps.

260
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,833
Should we hit the museums?

261
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,167
Should we use a foreign image?

262
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,967
-The Carnival in Rio de Janeiro?
-Brazil does have a strong lingerie image.

263
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,300
And it's summery.

264
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,933
Salsa from Cuba and Puerto Rico
could be interesting too.

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,267
How about New York's Ray Barretto
for the show's music?

266
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,200
It might give off an urban feel.

267
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,700
Salsa.

268
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,167
You know a lot about music.

269
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,800
But....

270
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,700
will it be difficult to visually present
Latin culture?

271
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,733
Anna...

272
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,067
What happened?

273
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,167
Are you hungry?
Should we eat something?

274
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,733
No, I'm not hungry.

275
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,700
What is it this time?

276
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:14,233
We got sandals last time.
Is it makeup?

277
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,733
You can use anything of mine you want.

278
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
I can't!

279
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,433
We're different sizes.

280
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,900
You wear the expensive ones from Emotion.

281
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,000
What?

282
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,967
I need a bra.

283
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,367
Everyone has cute ones.

284
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
You're making them now, right, Mom?

285
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,600
Cute, inexpensive ones?

286
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,267
It's your debut work, right?

287
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,833
Please?

288
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,200
Just one.

289
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,267
Can I?

290
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,433
Of course.

291
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,233
You can have one as a gift.

292
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,600
I can show it off in the locker room.

293
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,500
And then your bra will sell like hotcakes.

294
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,500
You think?

295
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,067
The February issue.

296
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,233
Here it is!

297
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,300
{\an8}THE 38TH ANNUAL DESIGN AWARD
TOKYO FASHION INSTITUTE FUMIKA IDA

298
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:38,600
APPEALING TO WOMEN OF HER GENERATION
BY WEARING HER OWN DESIGNS...

299
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,100
-So, this is Latin culture?
-Yes.

300
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,567
Let's dance!

301
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:03,633
Come on!

302
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,933
I can't dance!

303
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,167
I'm so sorry!

304
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,467
I'm sorry!

305
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,067
You gotta dance!

306
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,333
Good morning!

307
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,500
Good morning.

308
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,400
You have cleaning to do!

309
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,133
How's the show coming along?

310
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,767
I turned in the proposal yesterday.

311
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,733
Already? That's fast work!

312
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:49,233
I can't believe I pulled an all-nighter.

313
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,067
My skin.

314
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,633
I'm sorry, Reiko.

315
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,467
I'm going home.

316
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,733
If it's just for this morning,
that's fine.

317
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,467
Great, I'll leave it to you.

318
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,167
Boss!

319
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,300
What about the proposal?

320
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Yes.

321
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
{\an8}2015 TRUNK SHOW PROPOSAL

322
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:14,967
Sorry, I didn't feel it.

323
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,800
So, it isn't good?

324
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:21,133
If you're going to push for a Latin theme,
there should be more passion.

325
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,233
Something that expresses excitement.

326
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,767
You two are too serious!

327
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:29,733
{\an8}THE HISTORY OF LATIN MUSIC

328
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,500
{\an8}Why are you explaining Latin music?

329
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,533
It doesn't help me visualize anything.

330
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,200
What is it?

331
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,567
Right, there's no Emotion.

332
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,367
See you later.

333
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,200
I need a facial mask right away!

334
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,800
I need to moisturize!

335
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,567
It seems like the 1920s
would be the boss's thing.

336
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,033
Maybe not for this show.

337
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:16,767
The theme for this year's Paris show
was <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

338
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,167
It would be too similar.

339
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,867
Yeah.

340
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,800
There's a brand that even used

341
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:31,733
the <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>
as a theme.

342
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,633
It was for the fall and winter line.

343
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,433
You did a lot of research.

344
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,267
I figured I should study, too.

345
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:45,200
But...

346
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:48,233
what really is "emotion"?

347
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,500
Can I interrupt?

348
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,033
Of course, Miki.

349
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,233
I think it's good to research art,

350
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,767
but being new to the field,

351
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:14,400
I don't think anything creative will come
from just gathering information.

352
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,733
Do you work in fashion as well?

353
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,500
Don't worry about me.

354
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:24,567
In times like this, Mayu...

355
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
steal.

356
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:29,767
Steal? Steal what?

357
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,367
That's all I'm going to say.

358
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,267
You two lovebirds are making me jealous.

359
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,867
Miki, there's Yuri, your favorite.

360
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,067
Good evening.

361
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,467
Hi, Yuri.

362
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,533
Welcome.

363
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,800
Come and sit.

364
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,167
See you later.

365
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,833
This is my friend Yuri.

366
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,500
-We moved to Tokyo together.
-Yes! You've mentioned her.

367
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:58,800
-This is Sosuke Himeji, from work.
-Hello.

368
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,700
Mayu said you've helped her out a lot.

369
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,800
No, I haven't.

370
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,867
I should get going.

371
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,367
You don't have to leave on my account.

372
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,033
Don't worry.

373
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,067
I'll put together what we talked about.

374
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:12,867
See you tomorrow.

375
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,267
-Okay.
-Come again.

376
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,500
Here you go.

377
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,400
-So, what's this?
-What?

378
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,900
Sosuke?

379
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,300
He seems nice!

380
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,133
It's pretty common, you know,

381
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,833
falling for someone you work with.

382
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,900
What are you talking about? Of course not.

383
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:41,300
Well, it sure seemed that way to me.

384
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:44,400
Everything seems that way to you.

385
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,233
Did you find someone you like?

386
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,867
That's usually the case when you...

387
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,967
Am I that easy to read?

388
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,367
So you did? When?

389
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:01,033
Maybe a month ago?

390
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,733
-Someone from your company?
-No, but I met him through work.

391
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,767
The more we worked together,

392
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,900
the more I started to like him.

393
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,700
What's he like?
How old is he?

394
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,167
I'll tell you next time.

395
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:21,000
It's kind of complicated right now.

396
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,833
Are you okay?

397
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,967
Of course, I'm fine.

398
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:29,100
So it could happen to you too, Mayu!

399
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,400
With Sosuke...

400
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,933
No way. Forget it.

401
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:40,133
What's wrong? Do you have a headache?

402
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,433
I'm having trouble coming up with ideas.

403
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,800
For Emotion.

404
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,533
I'm sorry, Mayu!

405
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,067
I have to go to the bank now,
but I'll help when I get back.

406
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:59,133
Okay. Have a nice trip.

407
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,333
Is there anything wrong?

408
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,333
I'm going to borrow him for a while.

409
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,233
What am I thinking?

410
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,433
It's all Yuri's fault!

411
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,433
What are you thinking about?

412
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,400
It's nothing.

413
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:33,000
Are you making your own coffee, boss?

414
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:36,200
I have to. You're busy, right?

415
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:40,833
What?

416
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,533
Nothing.

417
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,633
It smells good.

418
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,100
Boss.

419
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,700
What is it?

420
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:56,333
What do you feel when you're creating?

421
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,567
That's a straightforward question.

422
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,933
What makes you feel like creating?

423
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,800
That feeling of, "I want to make this!"

424
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,233
What?

425
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,500
You're putting me on the spot.

426
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,433
I have no idea!

427
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,367
It smells so good!

428
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:22,100
Please!

429
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,200
So, you were serious?

430
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,467
Because last time--

431
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:33,700
Unfortunately, I'm in a position
where I must back Vanderbilt's decision.

432
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:37,600
If I support the production of
only selling 100 units per series,

433
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,367
then this contract...

434
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,333
Will disappear?

435
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,733
What?

436
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,933
Increasing the number is impossible.

437
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,167
You know our boss.

438
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,033
You know where she stands on this.

439
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,500
If we can convince Nanjo,

440
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,067
the contract will remain intact?

441
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:58,667
Why do you keep listening to him?

442
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,467
Why do you keep repeating the past?

443
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,900
-What?
-The last trunk show.

444
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:06,000
You didn't get to make your debut
in the end,

445
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,167
though your designs were good.

446
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:12,133
You're good enough to have your own brand.

447
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,100
Are you really satisfied?

448
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:31,767
We'd like to increase production
for Em and sell nationwide.

449
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,967
Wait, I didn't agree to this.

450
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,867
That was just Fujimura's wish.

451
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:39,200
He says that otherwise,

452
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:41,433
there will be no Em at all.

453
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,600
What?

454
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,767
I don't want that to happen.

455
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,867
You're the one who said not to take
Fujimura's words at face value.

456
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,200
Don't worry.

457
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,133
There's enough merit for them as it is.

458
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,967
Even if we sell at a slightly lower price,

459
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:57,533
to 100 customers instead of 10,

460
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,533
then it's just like Mr. Fujimura says.

461
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,767
Nothing has changed.

462
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,700
Wasn't the point of making a second line

463
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:11,967
to introduce our lingerie
to women all over Japan?

464
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:15,933
That won't mean anything unless
we consider taking it to a bigger scale.

465
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,800
I understand what you're saying.

466
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:24,233
We need to sell in a way that appeals
to all women.

467
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,633
Specifically?

468
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,733
Appeal to their desires.

469
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,500
Your words are passionate.

470
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,667
Create a strong brand image!

471
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,967
"All stylish women wear Em lingerie!"

472
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:44,267
It'll spark every woman's interest.

473
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,100
Your thoughts, Mizuki?

474
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,367
I think...

475
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:57,667
It's dangerous to recklessly
increase the production scale.

476
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,567
But I agree on widening
the range of our target customers.

477
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:11,267
Even young middle school girls
want stylish bras nowadays.

478
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,867
Teens are susceptible to trends.

479
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:18,933
Women buy out of desire.

480
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,133
"I want to be like her.
I want what she has."

481
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,533
It's the number one motivation for women.

482
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,100
If we appeal to that thinking,

483
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,533
the product will sell.

484
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,233
I don't doubt that.

485
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,567
But...

486
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:41,300
"I want to be like her.

487
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:44,033
I want what she has."

488
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,400
This is not how I want customers to feel.

489
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:50,600
Least of all, say, "You must have this."

490
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,800
That would be talking down to them.

491
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:57,800
Don't you think that's far from how
we should feel as creators?

492
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,900
Maybe so, but...

493
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
It should be up to the customers.

494
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,433
I want the customers to learn
how to recognize quality for themselves.

495
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,433
How many people in society
actually recognize quality?

496
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,000
That's a good question.

497
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,067
No one knows anything!

498
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:25,067
No one knows what to choose.

499
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:28,900
We're helping them by telling them,

500
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,033
"You'll be okay if you buy this."

501
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,933
Isn't that the power of a brand?

502
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,433
You're right.

503
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:49,567
But is there a story there?

504
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,267
Even if we're saying,
"You'll be okay if you buy this,"

505
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,767
is there a story there?

506
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,300
What story are you talking about?

507
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:09,167
If I had to create a green and yellow bra

508
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,067
for the simple reason that it was spring,

509
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,767
I couldn't, even if I was told to.

510
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,800
But if I was asked to create a bra

511
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:20,233
for a 17-year-old on her first date,
I could design one immediately.

512
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,233
Because I can picture her face.

513
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,433
I can see the story.

514
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,600
Of course, no one else
would get to see it.

515
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,933
But she'd want to wear
something a little sexier.

516
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,733
She's only 17, so she'd laugh at herself
if it was too sexy.

517
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:46,133
So I'd want to design something
bright and airy like a dandelion.

518
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,933
Maybe in green and yellow.

519
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,733
I know what you mean.

520
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,467
When a customer decides to buy something,

521
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:02,367
there's always a story there.

522
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:05,767
Even if you never see the customer,

523
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:09,833
you create with the customer in mind.

524
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:15,633
That's the true form of craftsmanship.

525
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,433
To blindly tell the customer,

526
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,433
"You'll be okay if you buy this..."

527
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,233
is too impertinent.

528
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,167
What's wrong?

529
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:04,267
Em seems to be in a difficult spot.

530
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,567
Yeah.

531
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,933
But I think I understand now.

532
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,900
That's it!

533
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,800
What are you guys doing?

534
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,700
Why is this happening?

535
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,067
Why'd you go with him? That's so stupid!

536
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,700
Just say you like him!

537
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,333
Finally! The kiss! Finally!

538
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:48,267
I'm going to go back to work now.

539
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,933
How about this?

540
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
How about to the right?

541
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,833
This much?

542
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,067
How's that?

543
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:09,433
Were you sleeping just now?

544
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,333
I was not.

545
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,567
It's done!

546
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,633
Will you explain it?

547
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,467
The theme for the show is...

548
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,800
"Story."

549
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:59,000
Every woman has a story.

550
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,900
Especially during spring and summer,

551
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,233
there are more opportunities
for new stories.

552
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:10,433
That sense of excitement and wonder
for what might happen next, is the theme.

553
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:17,267
The main point is to have a specific story
for each of our products.

554
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,967
The first date, as you mentioned,

555
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:23,667
or a deep confession of love.

556
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,867
Does it focus on love, then?

557
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:28,700
{\an8}Isn't that a little too simple?

558
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,200
{\an8}CASE 1: THE FIRST DATE

559
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,100
Love is just one example.

560
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:36,067
But it will be the most familiar.

561
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:40,000
Love stories are universal.

562
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:44,200
It seems like the right way
to quickly grab the customer's attention.

563
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
If we're introducing ten sets in the show,

564
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:53,133
we should have six to seven sets
containing love stories.

565
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:55,467
Because...

566
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,267
THE ME THAT'S IN LOVE WITH YOU

567
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,800
In these stories...

568
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,333
there is undeniable emotion.

569
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:05,900
Story.

570
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,400
Sounds good.

571
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,633
Really?

572
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,867
Well, it was really my idea.

573
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,967
-Yes.
-And also...

574
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:22,800
there aren't only stories
about beginnings.

575
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,533
There's also the story about the past.

576
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:29,533
An unforgettable story.

577
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,433
The story you keep in your heart.

578
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's express that in the last set.

579
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,133
It's going to be a good show.

580
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,567
Yes!

581
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,400
Yes!

582
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,300
Mayu!

583
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,000
Clean up the rest.

584
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,567
So what's the "story in your heart"?

585
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,467
You already know.

586
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,867
I know you've got a few yourself.

587
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:27,233
Perhaps.

588
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:31,767
When you live this long,
it's bound to happen.

589
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,900
So true.

590
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:35,533
But I've forgotten.

591
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,767
I've forgotten, I've forgotten.

592
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,633
We forget without trying.

593
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,933
Why did I walk over here just now?

594
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,067
I spoke with Sagawa, head of marketing.

595
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,133
I let him know that if you try to force us

596
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,700
into a nationwide market
with the threat of ending our project,

597
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,700
we'll have no choice
but to cut ties with you.

598
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,367
Emotion's goal is not just to make
a product that will be a hit.

599
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:26,567
We're providing our customers

600
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,633
with what we consider to be
a beautiful product,

601
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,333
using a method we believe in.

602
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,500
It's not a matter of quantity.

603
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,767
That sounds like a religion.

604
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,133
The church of Nanjo.

605
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,467
And I'm a proud member.

606
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,500
That's fine.

607
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:47,433
I appreciate your understanding.

608
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:51,233
But, Mr. Saruhashi.

609
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,700
Business doesn't run on idealism.

610
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,600
Let's go.

611
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,533
For this show, we'll take...

612
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,000
You.

613
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,367
You.

614
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:43,367
And...

615
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:47,733
You.

616
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,567
EVERY WOMAN HAS A STORY

617
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,267
EXPRESS YOURS THROUGH EMOTION LINGERIE

618
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,833
Nice!

619
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,200
Yes.

620
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:10,133
Looks good.

621
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:17,000
That looks pretty stylish.

622
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,567
Where's Mizuki and Fumi?

623
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:22,000
I think they're over at Em.

624
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:25,300
I told them to stop by this morning.

625
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,167
She's not picking up.

626
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:29,933
Maybe she's on the train.

627
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:33,833
-Hello, delivery!
-Coming!

628
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:38,567
I guess you lovebirds are making progress.

629
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:40,567
We're not lovebirds.

630
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,300
Of course not.

631
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,667
My shoulder's in pain.

632
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,833
I'm going to get acupuncture.

633
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:50,933
What's this?

634
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,100
It's for you.

635
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,267
I can't move my arm.
Will you open it?

636
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,333
Yes.

637
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,867
Boss, I'll massage your shoulder.

638
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,000
Thank you.

639
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,833
What?

640
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,333
What's wrong?

641
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,100
Notice for the launch of a new brand.

642
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:26,833
Dear Ms., we're happy to announce...

643
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,800
{\an8}Vanderbilt's Tokyo
will be introducing a private label...

644
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:35,900
{\an8}Vanderbilt's Factory will begin
production soon.

645
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,233
As part of the first step...

646
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,700
A lingerie brand...

647
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,000
Vanderbilt's Tokyo...

648
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:02,500
What?

649
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,500
DESIGNER FUMIKA IDA

650
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:10,800
DESIGNER MIZUKI NISHIZAWA

651
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:19,767
Mizuki and Fumika...

652
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,767
Every woman has a story.

653
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,100
EVERY WOMAN HAS A STORY

654
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:33,633
What's this?
What does this mean?

655
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:16,167
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
