1
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:18,700
{\an8}WE ARE CLOSED FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH

2
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:32,933
A summer break in January?

3
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,933
How amusing.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
It can't be helped.

5
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,000
It's been too hectic.

6
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,767
We haven't had any time to rest.

7
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,167
-Can I have a tomato please?
-Sure.

8
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm impressed that Emotion
was able to pull it together.

9
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,167
You could have gone out of business.

10
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,733
-And I'll have some tofu too.
-Sure.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,833
-I'll have some tofu as well.
-Sure.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, we went through some rough moments.

13
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,900
-Miss?
-Yes?

14
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,033
We'll have this Daiginjo, cold.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,400
Of course.

16
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:03,533
For Mayumi Nanjo,
all is fish that comes to the net.

17
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,133
Here's the tomato,

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
and the tofu.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,633
And one more tofu.

20
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,333
That's your last dish.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,533
This...

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,967
I'm okay.

23
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,800
I can have sake with rice, no problem.

24
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:22,700
It looks good.
I'll have one as well.

25
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,533
Here, you can have mine.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
No, you should eat yours.

27
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,067
I don't want it right now.

28
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,533
You ordered it.
You're responsible for eating it.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,467
You said you wanted it.
Why responsible? It's just tofu.

30
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,533
That's nothing to be arguing about.

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
We got together to celebrate, right?

32
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,167
That's right.
This is my way of thanking you.

33
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm grateful.

34
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,267
What?

35
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:52,200
For over 30 years,

36
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:56,100
you continued to write articles
about lingerie.

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,133
And had them published.

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,433
My work was recognized by the public
thanks to the words you wrote.

39
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,700
Yes, it's a wonderful relationship.

40
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:18,733
You must be feeling ill. Or dying.
Should I take you to the hospital?

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,900
You look happy, Shuko.

42
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,133
That will not happen.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,033
Of course not!
You don't have time to die.

44
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,800
Emotion is drastically growing
for the first time in 25 years.

45
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,733
Growing?

46
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,200
You can't be blamed
for what happened the first time.

47
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,200
You were young and couldn't keep up.

48
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,900
But closing the shop after one year

49
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,167
was a wise decision.

50
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,233
Shuko, you don't have
to bring up the past.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,233
You're okay with it, right?

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,133
You've finally recovered
from your past mistakes.

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
I suppose.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,900
Don't make that face.

55
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,967
Stop giving her a hard time.

56
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,400
That's not a look that says,
"Bring it on!"

57
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,700
"Bring it on"?
I'm too old for that.

58
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,367
What are you talking about?
Now's the perfect time!

59
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,633
You may only be able to move around freely

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,433
for another 10 years or so.

61
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,300
Be quiet.

62
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,633
I'm just tired and need a small break.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Don't just stand still.

64
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,667
Shuko.

65
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,933
When a talented designer,

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,833
who grows old and becomes satisfied
with her mediocre work,

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,500
takes a little break, she finds herself
no longer able to design.

68
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,600
I've seen it happen too many times.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
So don't stop.

70
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,200
What exactly are your plans for Emotion?

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,667
Will you develop Emotion

72
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,200
and pass it on to the next generation?

73
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:52,533
Or will you keep it in your hands

74
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,667
until the day you've grown too old...

75
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:56,867
and then extinguish it?

76
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,767
You have to make a choice.

77
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,700
It's now time for you to focus on a goal,

78
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:07,133
and start moving towards that goal.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,967
It's just a summer break.

80
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,533
It's only two weeks.
What's wrong with that?

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,067
I understand.

82
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:17,767
I have more urgent things to do
than be lectured by some old hag.

83
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,767
I understand.

84
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,867
You're leaving?

85
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,800
You're leaving for Kanazawa tomorrow,
right, Reiko?

86
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,633
Say hello to your husband for me.

87
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,433
And here.

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,433
I'll get you your change next time.

89
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,333
Thank you for your warning.

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,133
You're welcome.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

92
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,333
What?

93
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,700
You know she can be sensitive.

94
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,200
It's very likely that

95
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,000
she hasn't really gotten over the past.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,667
May there be many customers.

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,767
What are you doing?

98
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:31,967
Nothing, nothing.
Please come in.

99
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,033
Welcome.

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,433
What are you doing here so early?

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,867
I'm on summer break.

102
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,067
Wait. Now?

103
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,267
I see.

104
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,167
I went to the museum
I'd been wanting to go to.

105
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,500
I watched the movie
I'd been wanting to see.

106
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,533
I went to the textile factory.

107
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,733
I went shopping at a famous boutique.

108
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,300
There really isn't much
to do during a break.

109
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,433
So you're here because you're bored.

110
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,367
I lament my life at times like these.

111
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,433
I'd have nothing if I didn't have work.

112
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,800
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

113
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,267
Delicious!

114
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,500
Really? I'm glad.

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,467
You're picky about coffee, Mayu-chan.

116
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,467
Don't call me that.

117
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:25,967
That's from high school.

118
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,467
What's wrong with that?
You're Mayu-chan, I'm Yama-chan.

119
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,533
Mayu-chan, Yama-chan.

120
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,167
Mayu-Yama-chan!

121
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:34,300
-Stop that!
-You liked it.

122
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,333
This shop...

123
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
-Did you buy it?
-No, no.

124
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,400
Who was here before you?

125
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,867
I was hired as the manager.

126
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:47,867
<i>This is one of Mr. Shikishima's</i>
<i>coffee shops.</i>

127
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:51,600
<i>He's the one who taught me</i>
<i>all about coffee.</i>

128
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,033
I see.

129
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,200
So you quit the company?

130
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,933
Yes, I just felt it was time.

131
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
I see.

132
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,000
But...

133
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,667
I quit without saying anything...

134
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,300
to Mr. Yoshioka.

135
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,433
That's okay! It's your life, after all.

136
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,633
Besides, I'm sure he's not concerned
with others.

137
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,733
He's only interested in himself.

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,967
Sharp words, befitting an ex-wife.

139
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,700
Stop that.
It's already been 30 years.

140
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,467
Besides, it's your fault
for having introduced us.

141
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,667
You're the one who pestered me
into doing it.

142
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,400
You were in oil painting,

143
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,600
but you switched into industrial design
just for him!

144
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,067
No, I didn't!

145
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't remember?

146
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,667
You have a selective memory.

147
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,867
You always do that.
Remember the summer of our sophomore year?

148
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,100
I totally didn't do it.

149
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,333
You brought the fireworks.

150
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,467
But you shot the fireworks
into the teacher's office.

151
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,467
I went to apologize for that.

152
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:56,933
I got into so much trouble.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,700
What? You're the one who said you'd go.

154
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,867
-There you go again!
-No way!

155
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:02,933
You're wrong.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,567
You told me you'd go apologize for me.

157
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,433
I did not! It wasn't...

158
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Did I?

159
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,967
I did.

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
I forgot...

161
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,933
that I had been married.

162
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,067
I thought you guys made a great couple.

163
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,800
Mr. Yoshioka has talent.

164
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,867
You have talent.

165
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,933
He...

166
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Well, yes.

167
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,100
When I joined the car development team,

168
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:50,667
Mr. Yoshioka said to the guys
building the engine,

169
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,400
"The body I've designed is perfect.

170
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:57,133
And the engine you build
should fit my design."

171
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,067
It usually works the other way around
in the auto industry.

172
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,633
The body is supposed to fit the engine.

173
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,400
That sounds like him.

174
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,033
Someone so full of confidence

175
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,767
became so wretched.

176
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,767
Marriage is scary.

177
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,700
What would the two of you
talk about now, I wonder?

178
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,533
If I see his face,
the first thing I'll do is smack him.

179
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,767
I'd beat him to a pulp, and be taken away
for inflicting bodily harm.

180
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,000
I think you really would.

181
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,767
No, I wouldn't even recognize his face.

182
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,067
I've wiped him from my memory.

183
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,800
But you remember your son, don't you?

184
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,533
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,133
I know you don't like to talk about him.

186
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,533
But...

187
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,667
He's been dying to see you.

188
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,133
Your son, Seiran.

189
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,500
He wants to see you.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,367
He called me the other day.

191
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,500
He saw your show on the news.

192
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,133
It's amazing.

193
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,867
He's an adult now.

194
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,100
It's been a while since I heard...

195
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,300
that name.

196
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,800
Seiran.

197
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,200
It's the name of a color.

198
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,100
A mix of blue and indigo.

199
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,700
I was young and foolish when I named him.

200
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,733
It's a beautiful color, though.

201
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,600
Rather refined.

202
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,900
And masculine.

203
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,300
He's become quite a man.

204
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,300
I see.

205
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,433
He was five when his father and I split.

206
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,233
But you saw him once
when he was in middle school, right?

207
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:12,700
This would be a good opportunity,
as you have some time now.

208
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,767
-I can contact him, his number is--
-Stop it!

209
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,467
I have no intention of seeing him.

210
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,633
What's wrong?

211
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,300
Ms. Emi Mizuno
is currently in London for work.

212
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,567
She's extremely busy

213
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,833
and won't make it back
until the day before her wedding.

214
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,233
What? The day before?

215
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
Is her fitting finished?

216
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,333
Only for the dress.

217
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,167
Not for the accessories and headdress.

218
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:27,333
We've been communicating with photos.

219
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,900
<i>I want to make something</i>
<i>only I can make.</i>

220
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,333
I've been thinking.

221
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,267
About what only I can make.

222
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,867
KAJI

223
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,933
Welcome.

224
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,500
-Is this Emotion?
-Yes.

225
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,133
I'm so sorry.

226
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,867
We're closed for the month.

227
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,767
Is Mayumi Nanjo the president?

228
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,933
Yes.

229
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,900
The store opens again in February?

230
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,367
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,967
Please come again.

232
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,867
Thank you.

233
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,267
Well...

234
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,300
What's wrong?

235
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,233
You have no energy.

236
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,633
Really?

237
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,233
What happened to that amazing aura
you had during the show? It's gone.

238
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:47,333
Maybe it's this gloomy shop.

239
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,933
It's not this shop's fault.

240
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,367
Yes.

241
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,333
At the time, I was always ready
to make something better right away.

242
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,833
I feel a little too satisfied right now.

243
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:08,800
It's easy to lose sight
of what to do next.

244
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,933
Especially after you've completed
a grand project.

245
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,733
It's hard to see what's next.

246
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:20,567
Is that why you're making coffee now?

247
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,333
My grand project
was to make a tiny groove.

248
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,367
A groove to put your tablet
on the dashboard. A tiny groove.

249
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,667
But you completed it.

250
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:35,700
I don't know. Maybe I just felt like
that was enough and turned away.

251
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:40,233
You're not turning away,
are you, Mayu-chan?

252
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,900
Maybe I just can't.

253
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:50,200
There are too many other things
I've turned away from.

254
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:15,233
<i>What exactly are your plans for Emotion?</i>

255
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:32,000
Retail Space For Rent

256
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,067
Can you stop?
I'm talking to you.

NEW STORE DESIGN PLAN

259
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,567
You're opening next month?

260
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,367
The store will be in Ginza, right?

261
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,900
That's quite a feat.

262
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,767
He's always alone, you know.

263
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,933
I'm there.

264
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,067
His grandma's there.

265
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,200
And still,

266
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,600
he's always alone.

267
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,200
He's your son!

268
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Emotion.

269
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:38,800
Feelings?

270
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,300
Do you even have any?

{\an8}<i>Someone claiming to be your son</i>

273
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,267
<i>He left his business card.</i>

274
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:52,333
<i>He said he'd like to see you.</i>

275
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:15,700
Really?

276
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,267
He was here...

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,533
{\an8}21 YEARS AGO

278
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,233
Welcome.

279
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,700
-For one?
-No.

280
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,833
-You're meeting someone?
-Yes.

281
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,233
<i>Seiran.</i>

282
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,867
<i>He wants to see you.</i>

283
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,133
{\an8}What? Why?

284
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,333
Why can't I have lunch here today?

285
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,533
Well, you see...

286
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,167
There's a special customer coming today.

287
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:36,233
I apologize.

288
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,767
Important? Who is it?

289
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,567
Well that's...

290
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,000
It's Ms. Nanjo, isn't it?

291
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,133
How did you...

292
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,867
Am I right?

293
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,967
I was so surprised
when I heard you were classmates.

294
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:54,233
And that you quit your job to work here
to serve coffee, her favorite drink.

295
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,567
That's totally--

296
00:21:55,633 --> 00:22:00,300
No, we're just long-time acquaintances.

297
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:02,933
Working at this shop
was just a coincidence.

298
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,867
-What? You're lying.
-It's true.

299
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,033
So you asked her to come to the shop?

300
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,833
Is that why she's coming today?

301
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,200
You're nervous.

302
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,700
I'm not! This is just...

303
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,467
Mayu-chan... I mean...

304
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,500
It's not about Ms. Nanjo.
It's because her son is coming.

305
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:27,633
Ms. Nanjo has a son?

306
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,167
No.

307
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,567
Is it a big secret?

308
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:36,100
Please keep this between us.
Please!

309
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,433
Of course!

310
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,533
I'm sorry for getting involved
in your business!

311
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,267
No, that was my fault.

312
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay, okay!

313
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,500
I'll leave.

314
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm leaving. See you later!

315
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,067
Hello.

316
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Hello!

317
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,133
Ms. Konno. It's nice to see you.

318
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,900
Do you work near here?

319
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,500
Well...

320
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,700
I'm not here for work.

321
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,033
Well...

322
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,567
By any chance...

323
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,267
Yes?

324
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,333
Nothing.

325
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm leaving now.

326
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,600
-I'll see you next time.
-Okay.

327
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,367
See you.

328
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:43,867
{\an8}<i>Seiran's at the shop.</i>
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

329
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,733
I'm sorry to be so blunt.

330
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:02,867
It's fine...

331
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,000
But,

332
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,233
I knew by looking at you.

333
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,200
Knew what?

334
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,300
That you come from a good family.

335
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,033
Do I?

336
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,300
You're going to a good school, yes?

337
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,000
You play tennis.

338
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:29,467
Your shoes and bag are of fine quality.

339
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,000
Maybe that's all there is.

340
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,800
Isn't that enough?

341
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,233
It's no small feat to raise you so well.

342
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,300
Aren't you using the fact
that your mother is not your real mother

343
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,633
as an excuse?

344
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,467
I'm sorry.

345
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:56,867
I tend to speak my mind.

346
00:24:57,967 --> 00:24:59,300
It seems so.

347
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:08,467
I thought maybe
my birth mother would understand me.

348
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:15,533
Or is that just a fantasy
that happens in the movies?

349
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:20,033
It's a fantasy that's usually crushed,
even in the movies.

350
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,000
Just one more question.

351
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,000
You might find it childish.

352
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:31,900
Go ahead.

353
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,667
Why did you come?

354
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,100
-Here.
-Thank you.

355
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,367
Will she come?

356
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,100
I'll try calling.

357
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:09,733
EMOTION - MAYUKO TOKITA

358
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,533
Why are you ignoring it?

359
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:40,567
-Why don't you go see him--
-Your meddling has gone too far.

360
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,800
You've done your part.

361
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,200
If you go any further,

362
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,267
I won't forgive you.

363
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,267
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,233
But...

365
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
if my mother was alive,

366
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:58,167
-I'd want to see her--
-That's enough!

367
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,200
You don't know the circumstances.

368
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,567
What are the circumstances?

369
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,733
I don't know what happened.

370
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,100
But,

371
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,633
a child wants to see his mother,

372
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,867
and he's right under her nose.

373
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,467
And yet his mother won't see him.

374
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:24,300
What kind of circumstances
could justify that?

375
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,500
If you truly believe that
you can't see him,

376
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,400
then you're wrong.

377
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,867
Unless one of you has died,

378
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,333
there's no circumstance
under which a mother can't see her child.

379
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,533
You really love that color,
don't you, boss?

380
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,933
Indigo.

381
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,767
That's indigo too.

382
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,733
I'm sorry for meddling.

383
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,433
I'm so nervous,
I keep going to the restroom.

384
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,867
I guess she's not coming.

385
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,733
Wait, I'll call her.

386
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:23,633
Thank you for coming.

387
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,100
I've wanted to see you for a long time.

388
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,800
But,

389
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:39,167
Father never talks about you.

390
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,467
And well,

391
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:44,033
there's also my mother and sister.

392
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:48,100
I've had a difficult time bringing it up.

393
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:56,533
Will you say something?

394
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,433
Since we're here.

395
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,500
I'm sorry.

396
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,900
Your first words are...

397
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,433
"I'm sorry"?

398
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,133
No, it's fine.

399
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:20,567
So...

400
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,000
That thing.

401
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:24,700
You still have it.

402
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,200
The sculpture of a woman
wearing lingerie.

403
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,100
<i>When I saw it at the store,</i>

404
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,333
<i>I thought, "It's that thing."</i>

405
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>It brought back memories.</i>

406
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,467
You remember it?

407
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,400
Yes, I remember.

408
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,933
Father bought it.

409
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,500
The fact that the sculpture
was wearing underwear

410
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,367
was so funny, I laughed.

411
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,133
But you were...

412
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,833
so happy.

413
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,500
Father's doing well.

414
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:01,933
I see.

415
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:06,533
Here you are.

416
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:09,133
Mr. Yamazaki,

417
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,733
my father is indebted to you.

418
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,500
I'm the one who's indebted to him.

419
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,833
Mr. Yoshioka's risen to the top.

420
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,800
He's the company director.

421
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:21,867
My father is an ambitious man,
but you already know that.

422
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,400
He's an accomplished man.

423
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:28,633
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,033
Please enjoy.

425
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,200
It's delicious.

426
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,500
You've become...

427
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,067
a fine young man.

428
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:03,700
You work for a prestigious company.

429
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,633
My business card.

430
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
No.

431
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,133
I was good at studying.

432
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,267
But I have no special talents.

433
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,267
It's quite an accomplishment.

434
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,933
Your father...

435
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,400
and your mother...

436
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,200
must be very proud.

437
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,733
It's hard to say.

438
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:36,067
My father always tells me
what a dull guy I am.

439
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,700
He's proud of you.

440
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
That's not it.

441
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,133
I didn't come here
just to make small talk.

442
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,500
I'm getting married.

443
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:09,767
The wedding is in two weeks.

444
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,767
I see.

445
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,000
Congratulations.

446
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,133
I don't know why.

447
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,933
But I really wanted you to know.

448
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,400
I know it's not a big deal or anything.

449
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,933
But I wanted you to know.
That's all.

450
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,900
I'm going to start my own family.

451
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:44,200
So please don't worry about me.

452
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:50,567
I'm not alone.

453
00:34:56,667 --> 00:35:00,800
Actually, I've never been alone.

454
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,233
Like you said long ago,

455
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,333
my parents cared for me.

456
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,400
And...

457
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,433
I clearly remember...

458
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,567
the sound of your sewing machine.

459
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,967
I was always at your feet,

460
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:30,533
<i>watching you press your pedal.</i>

461
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:32,933
<i>I was fascinated.</i>

462
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,333
<i>The machine would hum.</i>

463
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,867
<i>I'd look up</i>
<i>and I'd see the handles turning.</i>

464
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,900
<i>Bits of lace that looked like spider webs</i>
<i>would fall.</i>

465
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,533
<i>I'd gather them up into a ball...</i>

466
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,433
<i>and stuffed them in my tiny truck.</i>

467
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,167
<i>The factory was under the table.</i>

468
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:00,233
<i>It was made out of a cookie box.</i>

469
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,867
<i>My truck would go back and forth,</i>

470
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,033
<i>and I worked just as hard.</i>

471
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,400
<i>It was fun.</i>

472
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,733
I really had so much fun.

473
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,667
I was...

474
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,067
never alone.

475
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,500
I'm sorry, I'm making this all about me.

476
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,567
But...

477
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,600
I feel better now that I've talked to you.

478
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm glad I got to see you.

479
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,900
After the wedding,
we're going to Europe for our honeymoon.

480
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:04,967
And then my wife and I
will live in London.

481
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,600
So I wanted to see you now.

482
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,333
I see.

483
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:16,800
I won't be back in Japan for a while.

484
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,967
You must be working hard.

485
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,433
Like your father.

486
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,200
It's not like that.

487
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,700
I'm actually following my wife.

488
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:37,733
My wife's been recruited
by a think tank in London.

489
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,667
A think tank?

490
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:44,667
I'll be leaving my job in March,

491
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:48,333
and attending a university in London.

492
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,533
I wanted to study theater.

493
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:52,533
Theater?

494
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:55,133
I'm sorry.

495
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,667
I'll be working part-time for a while.

496
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,367
My wife and I will make it work.

497
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,133
Because,

498
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,100
unlike my father,

499
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,133
I won't be jealous of my wife's career.

500
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm sorry, my lunch break is over.

501
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,900
Thank you for the coffee.

502
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,067
Of course.

503
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,600
Thank you.

504
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:37,433
Say, can I introduce you
to my wife sometime?

505
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,367
-She's in London now, but the wedding--
-Let's not do that.

506
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,000
The happiness you've found...

507
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,667
is for you and your family to share.

508
00:38:58,767 --> 00:38:59,900
With your father,

509
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,333
and your mother,

510
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,367
and your sister.

511
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:12,500
Whatever little bit of happiness
you experience,

512
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,833
you must not...

513
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,267
share it with me.

514
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,100
This will be the last time we meet.

515
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:28,567
You haven't changed.

516
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
It was...

517
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,900
when I was in middle school, wasn't it?

518
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,833
You were the same then.

519
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,200
I tried to get closer to you,

520
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,333
but you wouldn't let me near you.

521
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,567
I don't care if you blame yourself.

522
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Because...

523
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,533
your attitude hasn't changed.

524
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,333
Though it may seem
as if you're being tough on yourself,

525
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,167
it's quite the opposite.

526
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,833
You know that I'm holding back.

527
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,600
And so,

528
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:13,000
you calmly step back from your child.

529
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,800
You show regard for my family,
as if you're a stranger.

530
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,233
You refuse to show
any unpleasant part of yourself.

531
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,233
How skillful of you.

532
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,633
But...

533
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:32,467
it's all for your own satisfaction.

534
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,100
It's unfair.

535
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:44,800
I'm revealing so much of myself to you.

536
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,100
But I get nothing from you.

537
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,400
Don't you feel anything?

538
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,167
I felt...

539
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,667
that I needed to go to you.

540
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,333
Back then,

541
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:16,667
when you contacted me,

542
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,933
I thought something had happened.

543
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,533
And that I had to go to you.

544
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,733
I couldn't stand still.

545
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,900
I ran out of the store to go to you.

546
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,333
It didn't seem that way to me.

547
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,367
Because...

548
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,133
you looked so different.

549
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,600
In my memories,

550
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,600
you were this small,

551
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:53,633
<i>and always by my feet.</i>

552
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:58,667
If you didn't see me
for even one moment, you'd cry.

553
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,800
<i>But...</i>

554
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,233
<i>the boy that appeared in front of me</i>

555
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,367
<i>was all grown up.</i>

556
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,267
<i>He looked like an adult.</i>

557
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:12,367
You were wearing a uniform.

558
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,067
Your voice had changed.

559
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,767
You ordered ginger ale.

560
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:22,967
<i>You spoke so well and so confidently.</i>

561
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,133
I...

562
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,767
no longer know anything about you.

563
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:40,233
What makes you laugh,

564
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,767
what makes you cry,

565
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,767
or what worries you've been carrying
throughout your life.

566
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,300
I...

567
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:56,667
don't know anything!

568
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,967
I realized...

569
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,233
that this is the price to pay

570
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,767
for having let go of my own child.

571
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,100
And after that,

572
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,433
all I could do was act
as if I was a stranger.

573
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,467
It's all right.

574
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:28,600
We are strangers.

575
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,733
We've been spending our times differently.

576
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,733
We've been caring about different things.

577
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,500
That's the truth about you and me.

578
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,667
Perhaps.

579
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:53,667
And so...

580
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,200
this will be the last time we meet.

581
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,000
I understand.

582
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:14,367
I'm glad we got to talk.

583
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,200
I'll go now.

584
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,467
One more thing.

585
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,867
Just once,

586
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,600
will you call me by my name?

587
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,700
It's the name you gave me.

588
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,600
I don't know if it's a color, or what.

589
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,400
But it's been giving me a hard time
for 36 years.

590
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,400
No one can read it.

591
00:44:58,767 --> 00:44:59,867
I guess not.

592
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,167
I'm sorry I asked.

593
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Seiran.

594
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:17,133
Seiran.

595
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,667
I'm sorry...

596
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:28,067
for giving you such a strange name.

597
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,800
It's okay.
I kind of like it.

598
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:43,733
And also...

599
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:48,033
why did you come?

600
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:55,433
Because...

601
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,233
your face.

602
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:01,400
I wanted to see it.

603
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,267
He's a good boy.

604
00:46:53,133 --> 00:46:54,133
His father...

605
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:58,067
must have re-married a wonderful woman.

606
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:07,200
I have to be grateful.

607
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,000
Are you okay?

608
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,167
I hate it.

609
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,033
He's just like him.

610
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:31,233
His fingers, his voice.

611
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,333
From the back,
I thought it was his father.

612
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:39,600
The type of man I like.

613
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,267
I told you,

614
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,667
you've always liked the good-looking ones.

615
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:48,800
A sucker for good-looking guys.

616
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,267
That's why it never works out.

617
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,667
Be quiet.

618
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,400
But he's like you too, Mayu-chan.

619
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:02,567
Do you think so?

620
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:06,567
He's eccentric, just like you.

621
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,700
Thank you.

622
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,567
Will you put this on the house?

623
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:33,133
What, really?
Fine, I guess.

624
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,633
You're leaving?

625
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:37,067
I'm going to work.

626
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:40,100
You know me.

627
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:42,333
That's all I've got.

628
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:16,267
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
