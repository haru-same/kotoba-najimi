00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:15,633
{\an8}Welcome.

2
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,600
May I help you?

3
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,167
You can bring me this bra.

4
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,633
It's for my allergies.
You know, it's fall.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,067
It's all that ragweed!

6
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:50,167
Don't worry.
I'll bring you the bra.

DESIGNER MIZUKI NISHIZAWA
DESIGNER FUMIKA IDA

8
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:07,033
How and when did you come up with
the concept of Story?

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,800
It was while discussing marketing
with President Nanjo at Emotion.

10
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:16,600
That's when the term "Story" came up.

11
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:21,400
So the Story concept was Nanjo's idea?
Is that right?

12
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,967
Well...

13
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,633
we were inspired by her words,

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,667
but we made it into what it is today.

15
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,800
Nanjo had nothing to do with it.

16
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:33,433
Have you parted ways with President Nanjo?

17
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,133
That sounds so final.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Story is a new brand,
aimed at a younger generation.

19
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,467
All products have a shelf life,

20
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,400
so it's normal
for new things to come along

21
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,833
with every new generation.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,933
It sounds as though you're saying that
Emotion is obsolete.

23

EM BY EMOTION TEAM
MIZUKI - FUMIKA - SARUHASHI - HIME

25
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,800
So you actually went there?

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,033
Yes. A little while ago.

27
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,733
How was it?

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Can I see?

29
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,633
The store was beautiful.

30
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,500
It was full of customers.

31
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,600
I see.

32
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,567
This is nice.

33
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,767
You should stop looking at this stuff.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,267
"We wanted to express
the story inside every woman."

35
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,933
How can they do this?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,767
{\an8}A PRODUCT BY TWO WOMEN
FOR ALL WOMEN

37
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,667
The product, the concept.
It's all Emotion's.

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,000
This.

39
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,967
This, this and this!
All of it!

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Why?

41
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,633
How many magazines did you buy, Mayu?

42
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,667
They never used to run
articles on lingerie,

43
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,667
and now, suddenly,
"All women need a Story."

44
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,233
What's going on?

45
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,600
It's good, isn't it?

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,800
Let's see. "Story.

47
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,567
It's what's inside a woman that matters."

48
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,067
They got that right.

49
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,167
Boss.

50
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,933
The orders for Ms. Kubo and Ms. Hayashi
are ready.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,467
Find out when they're available
for a fitting.

52
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:40,967
All right.

53
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:44,367
So, all our orders...

54
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,333
Are done!

55
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,533
Now, I can go rest.

56
00:03:58,767 --> 00:03:59,967
This is good.

57
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,167
Where's it from?

58
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,267
Does that really matter?

59
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,233
Well, someone's in a bad mood.

60
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:12,167
Why haven't you said anything
about what happened, boss?

61
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,633
It's great!

62
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,333
They're now running
more articles on lingerie.

63
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,767
What do you mean?

64
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,667
They stole everything from us!

65
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,600
Stole what?

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,800
Mizuki made those, right?

67
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,767
But it's an exact copy of Emotion's style.

68
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,033
That's right.

69
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Down to the concept of Story.

70
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,467
Story is not a patented term.

71
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,067
We can just do our own version.

72
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,400
We haven't yet printed
the invitations for the show, have we?

73
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,333
No. It's been on hold.

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,367
Change the date and have them printed.

75
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:52,333
The trunk show is still on.

76
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,967
The theme will be...

77
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,367
Story.

78
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,533
Well? There's no time to waste.

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,067
Let's make it happen.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,533
That means I'll have to make
many more items.

81
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,167
I must be in hell!

82
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,733
She's right.

83
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:21,200
Let's show them who the original is.

84
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,667
We can do it!

85
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,267
We've finalized the plans.

86
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,800
We've purchased the materials.

87
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,100
The models are ready to go!

88
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,100
Let's do this!

89
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,267
Yeah!

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,433
We apologize for canceling the order.

91
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,700
We'd be happy to pay the fees.

92
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,967
{\an8}DETAILED INVOICE

93
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,933
{\an8}I'm sorry, but we do have to charge you.

94
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,700
I mean, we have people on the payroll.

95
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,033
Of course.
We understand.

96
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,367
You'll get paid by the end of the month.

97
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,200
Is everything all right?

98
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,367
Don't tell me
the company's going bankrupt.

99
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,333
Of course not.

100
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,733
I'm back.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
-Welcome back.
-We're glad you're back.

102
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,600
What's going on?

103
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,400
We're moving forward with the trunk show.

104
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,267
The theme will be "Story."

105
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,567
Seriously?

106
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,633
Yes!

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,333
Here it is.

108
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,733
One hundred and seventy-three copies,
please.

109
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,967
Sure.

110
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:57,967
I submitted the invitations.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,067
I'm meeting up with Sosuke in Ebisu,

112
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,433
and we'll go see
the people in charge of lighting.

113
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,233
Yes.

114
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,567
Bye.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
Wait! Stop!
Hold on!

116
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,533
Yes?

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,333
It's dangerous.

118
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,867
What's wrong, young lady?

119
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,267
Are you lost?

120
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,733
Where do you need to go?

121
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,033
I'll help you.

122
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,400
Isn't this area interesting?

123
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,833
The shops here have been around forever.

124
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,467
The dorayaki here is delicious!

125
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,433
They're often mentioned on TV.

126
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,233
Do you live around here?

127
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,400
Yes! Very close to here.

128
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,167
I've been in Ginza for 50 years now.

129
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm a walking encyclopedia!

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,233
We're here.

131
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,867
Here's the yakitori shop
you wanted to go to.

132
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,967
The oyakodon here is delicious!

133
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,200
It shouldn't be too crowded at this time.

134
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,267
Goodbye.

135
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,500
Wait!

136
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,433
What is it?

137
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,933
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,067
May I?

139
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,167
I feel like a princess.

140
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,300
Thank you very much
for helping me.

141
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,167
Make sure you eat lunch

142
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,833
so that you can get back to work.

143
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,567
Yes!

144
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,233
Three more to go.

145
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,733
It's so beautiful.

No.

149
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Will you wait a moment?

150
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
I understand.

Wait a second.

00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,433
Can I see that?

154
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:50,967
"Your new product,

161
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,833
We're being sued?
They can't be serious!

162
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,100
They stole from us!

163
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,733
We'll just turn it back on them!

164
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,867
That's right. If that's what they want,

165
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,767
we'll just prove in court
that we came up with it first!

166
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,967
We can't do that.

167
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,133
Why not?

168
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,333
The fees are outrageous.

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,867
The trial could go on forever.

170
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
And since they went public first,
we'd be at a great disadvantage.

171
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,033
But we were first.

172
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,333
The printing company and the models
can be witnesses.

173
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,433
That may not make for
strong enough evidence.

174
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,200
Then what should we do?

175
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,267
They're offering to settle...

176
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,767
if we stop the trunk show.

177
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:57,133
So they don't want us to compete with
the same Story.

178
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,733
If we force the trial and lose,

179
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,767
they'll ask for
exorbitant fees in damages.

180
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,067
If that happens,

181
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,133
Emotion will go bankrupt.

182
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,000
The trunk show will have to be canceled.

183
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,800
You've both worked so hard.

184
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,067
Thank you.

185
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,533
The trunk show
has unfortunately been canceled

186
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,733
due to unforeseen circumstances...

187
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,167
Are you okay?

188
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,900
But I still don't get it.

190
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,233
I can't accept it.

191
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
Neither Mizuki nor Fumika

192
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,867
would do something like this.

193
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,933
Well, you just never know with women.

194
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,100
They're scary creatures.

195
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,833
Even I never suspected them
of conspiring together.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,233
So this is what it must feel like.

197
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,467
A guy could think
that he's betraying two women,

198
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,800
when in fact, the women get together

199
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,233
and make sure he gets burned.

200
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,533
Why are you joking about this?

201
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,167
Wasn't it funny?

202
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,167
Mr. Saruhashi,

203
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,133
you always stand off to the side,

204
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,900
as if you're not a part of all this.

205
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,200
But you're just afraid

206
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,300
of having to face challenges
and getting hurt.

207
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,967
You just look away!

208
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,300
Mayu.

209
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:19,700
I know that you worked
as hard as everyone else did on Em.

210
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,867
It must be upsetting to you too.

211
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,233
You should just admit it.

212
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,833
Don't act like it doesn't affect you!

213
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,667
Just another day at the office.

214
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,233
What do you mean?

215
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,367
You're suing Emotion?

216
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,567
I'm just trying to protect the company.

217
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,100
We won't really go to trial.

218
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,867
Is it to protect Story?

219
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:14,900
That's exactly right.

220
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,967
The product was a hit,

221
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,600
and sold twice as much as expected
in the first week.

222
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,833
Not only in Ginza, but nationwide.

223
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,800
We want to protect our assets.

224
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,767
This isn't right.

225
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,567
Story originally came from Emotion.

226
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,733
Well, I apologize.

227
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
I didn't realize that.

228
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,467
That's a lie.
It was all calculated.

229
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,367
So what if it was?

230
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,767
What will you do about it?

231
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,067
Will you testify

232
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,767
that we, all of us,

233
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,300
stole everything?

234
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,300
<i>We can't go back!</i>

235
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,567
Everything's good, isn't it?

236
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,667
Your daughter's happy, right?

237
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,467
She buys all the magazines.

238
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,300
With the little allowance she has.

239
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,400
She's a good girl.

240
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,067
She is.

241
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,267
You designed the concept.

242
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,433
Aren't you happy it's doing so well?

243
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,433
Of course.

244
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,833
But this way of doing things,

245
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,033
it isn't me.

246
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,467
Whatever the method,

247
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:49,067
our current success
is exactly what I dreamed of.

248
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,767
This is what I wanted.

249
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,600
For women all over Japan

250
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,333
to wear what I designed.

251
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:04,900
So, I have no regrets.

252
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm going to push forward with this.

253
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm so sorry.

254
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,367
Don't worry.

255
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,433
I'll be fine.

256
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,433
But still, it's work.

257
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
That's true.

258
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm disappointed I lost the job.

259
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm upset.

260
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,267
But...

261
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,733
I understand how you feel.

262
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,267
I do.

263
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
Poor girl.

266
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,000
It's already been a month
since we got a new order.

267
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:12,200
Canceling the show really hurt us.

268
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:17,033
But even our regular customers
haven't been ordering anything.

269
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,900
Perhaps they all went to Story.

270
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:23,367
Ouch!

271
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,667
The last deposits
were from Ms. Hayashi and Ms. Kubo.

273
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,800
We're in a tough spot.

274
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:39,033
We still owe a debt
from when we launched the Em line.

2015 SALES PROJECTIONS

{\an8}You already have our business plan.

00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,567
{\an8}Here is our sales projections.

278
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,800
And this is our budget.

279
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,533
For the next year, we plan to--

280
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,533
Listen. I can feel your passion.

281
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:56,133
But extending the loan may be difficult.

282
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,000
Why is that?

283
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,833
We've heard what's been going on.

284
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,833
We understand
you're involved in a lawsuit.

285
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,433
It's a tough situation.

286
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,433
The matter has already been settled!

287
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Depending on how things unfold,
we may have to withdraw altogether.

288
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,667
Please, wait!

289
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,600
We came here to have the loan extended.

290
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,367
There was no prior talk of withdrawal.

291
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:21,100
If you do this, we'll go bankrupt!

292
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:34,633
The lawsuit is hurting us.

293
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,367
We still owe payments
to our client companies,

294
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:39,600
but we have no cash flow.

295
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,267
I was too naive.

296
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,233
Expanding the business

297
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,933
changes our financial structure

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,267
into something completely different
from our small cash business.

299
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,233
It's my fault that we lost Em.

300
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
No.

301
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,267
I'm the proprietor.

302
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,833
I'm sorry to interrupt.

303
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:04,733
Sosuke wants to speak with you.

304
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,367
I know it's a selfish request.

305
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,300
And the timing couldn't be worse.

306
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,633
But I always felt
this job wasn't right for me.

307
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,033
I'm still not comfortable
around women's lingerie.

308
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,067
I'm probably useless to you anyways.

309
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,567
But you've been working so hard lately.

310
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:32,633
That's why...

311
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,800
I want to find a job

312
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:37,900
I can excel at.

313
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,900
Please accept my resignation.

314
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,833
I apologize for the sudden notice.

315
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,133
Please.

316
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
You scared me!

317
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,933
Are you all right?

318
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,167
I'm a terrible person.

319
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,067
I allowed my employee
to make the sacrifice.

320
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,400
You mean Sosuke?

321
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,033
He quit in order to help save Emotion.

322
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,933
I'm repeating the same mistakes.

323
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,733
I force those close to me
into making tough choices.

324
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,800
And yet, I'm still incapable
of overcoming the same issues.

325
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:05,100
Can I really move forward like this?

326
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,800
Everyone knows why you did it.

327
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,133
Everyone's wrong.

328
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:28,100
I wanted to help Emotion,

329
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,167
but I couldn't.

330
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,433
That's why I'm giving up.

331
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
That's not true.

332
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,733
How can you be so sure?

333
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Because

334
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,233
you were working so hard.

335
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,267
I'm getting out of there.

336
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,267
But...

337
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:56,100
I wish I'd gotten Mr. Saruhashi's approval
at least once.

338
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:02,800
Up until the very end,
I was of no use to him.

339
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Well, then.

340
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,733
Let's work until you get his approval.

341
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,533
I was telling the truth.

342
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,533
I really want to find a job

343
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,333
I'm good at.

344
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,567
A job that allows me to evolve.

345
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,467
That's the way I really feel.

346
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,833
Is that so bad?

347
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
So.

348
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,100
Is Emotion not that kind of place for you?

349
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:56,667
Emotion's not for me.

350
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,233
We had fun though, didn't we?

351
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,733
All those galleries

352
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,267
and salsa dancing.

353
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,100
Don't make that face.

354
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,933
Mayu.

355
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,700
I think Emotion is right for you.

356
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:25,800
So.

357
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:28,700
Don't give up.

358
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,367
Wait!

359
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,600
Wait!

360
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,667
Wait!

361
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:48,767
Do you really expect
we'll get customers this way?

362
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,567
Have some faith.

363
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,933
We just have to do it.

364
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,567
Here!

365
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,767
Even just one customer would help.

366
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:58,900
Please, take one.

367
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,867
Please, take one.

368
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:04,000
Please, take one.

369
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,733
Thank you!

370
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Please, take one.

371
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,567
So brave.

372
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,833
And cute.

373
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,700
Please, take one.

374
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,933
-Please, take one.
-Please, take one.

375
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Please, take one.

376
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,467
Please, take one.

377
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,467
-Please, take one.
-We make custom lingerie.

378
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:23,533
Please, take one.

379
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,100
Wait!

380
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,400
Please, take one.
Thank you.

381
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,367
Mayu? Where did she go?

382
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,333
You used to be a geisha?

383
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,867
A long time ago.

384
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,767
Now I teach shamisen.

385
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:50,400
And what do you do, young lady?

386
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,400
I work in lingerie.

387
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,800
At a shop that makes women's underwear.

388
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,033
How beautiful!

389
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,667
But I'm sorry,

390
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,767
I usually wear a kimono, you know?

391
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,433
So, I don't wear a bra.

392
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:14,067
That's all right.

393
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,400
It brings back memories.

394
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
I used to go dancing with my husband.

395
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,367
Dancing?

396
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,700
I never had a nice underwear set.

397
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,833
So I brought my husband with me

398
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,667
to a store I used to pass by near here.

399
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:37,000
The beautiful young woman at the shop

400
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:40,767
made a bra for me that fit just right.

401
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,600
Was that...

402
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:47,533
It was my husband's only gift to me.

403
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,300
I still have it.

404
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,200
It's a little beat up now,

405
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,767
but I still have it.

406
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,233
You know what?

407
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,167
COURTHOUSE

408
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:08,533
I have to stay for the next trial.

409
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,900
Thank you so much.

410
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,633
-Hello.
-It's been awhile.

411
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,367
Looks like you're working hard.

412
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:38,233
We don't all have company lawyers

413
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,633
that can take care of everything for us.

414
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,267
It's been quite a hassle.

415
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,433
Shall I introduce you to a good lawyer?

416
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,000
You have no shame, do you?

417
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:54,300
You're so brazen, I'm not even sure
"unscrupulous" is the right word for you.

418
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,267
Unscrupulous?

419
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,433
That's not it.

420
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,033
You said that numbers were not an issue.

421
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,767
Numbers are the issue.

422
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,900
Whether it's capital stock or sales,

423
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:14,767
sponsors or employees,

424
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,367
you're working
on a completely different scale

425
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,633
than Vanderbilt's Tokyo.

426
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,733
There's a gap in power between us.

427
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,667
Justice and idealism
can never bridge that gap.

428
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,667
Always remember that

429
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:33,567
numbers equal power.

430
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,300
When you get power from numbers,

431
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:38,967
even if ideas get stolen from a small,
unknown company,

432
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:42,167
you can come out of it unaffected.

433
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:44,333
Wouldn't you call that being unscrupulous?

434
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,500
It seems you still don't understand.

435
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:57,267
Business can get ugly.

436
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,600
I've already told you that.

437
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,833
Yes, this was it.

438
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,267
It brings back memories.

439
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,367
Please.

440
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,333
Welcome.

441
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,267
Mrs. Ono.

442
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,700
Is your name Ono?

443
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,933
How many years has it been?

444
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:45,833
I'm so glad to see you again.

445
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,000
You're the shop girl who helped me.

446
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,067
Yes.

447
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,567
Please, come in.

448
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,933
I'm glad you called ahead.

449
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,400
We pulled the customer list
from 30 years ago.

450
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:10,300
It was easy
since you organized the stockroom.

451
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,833
{\an8}DOB 7/19/46 - MRS. AYA ONO
OCCUPATION: GEISHA

452
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,433
Did the boss recognize her right away?

453
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,333
Geishas were rare.

454
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Even so, that's amazing.

455
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,300
Do you remember?

456
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Excuse me.

457
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,133
Here is the bra.

458
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,333
It's so old.

459
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,400
I've had it for 30 years, after all.

460
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,767
Yes.

461
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,533
Thank you so much.

462
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,100
You've taken such good care of it.

463
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,667
The lace has slightly come undone.

464
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,100
But I just couldn't throw it away.

465
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,767
It holds memories of your husband?

466
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,467
That's right.

467
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:24,900
Let me fix it for you.

468
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:28,400
May I take some new measurements?

469
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,867
Of course.

470
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,533
I've changed quite a bit.

471
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:48,533
I've been wearing kimonos
since I was a teenager.

472
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,667
I never really owned any underwear.

473
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,633
So my husband suggested buying some.

474
00:32:55,933 --> 00:33:00,967
We must have been
around 40 years old, then.

475
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,500
I was a little embarrassed.

476
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,667
When I walked into the store,
my face turned bright red.

477
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,367
I remember.

478
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:10,267
Your husband seemed like a nice man.

479
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,367
In the end,

480
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:19,200
my husband never looked at it.

481
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
I suppose that's not very surprising.

482
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,833
A wife's underwear
can be quite embarrassing for a man.

483
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,300
It's done.

484
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,133
How wonderful!

485
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,367
Will you try it on?

486
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:54,600
I've pulled the wires
and changed the shape,

487
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,000
so that you can wear it
under a kimono as well.

488
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:00,700
I hope you will wear it.

489
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:05,967
Thank you.

490
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
I almost forgot.

491
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,633
How much do I owe you?

492
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,033
Don't worry about that.

493
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,400
The lace was from the excess pile.

494
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:28,400
And we never charge for repairs.

495
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,500
That doesn't feel right.

496
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,700
Please, let me pay.

497
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,600
It's not much, but please take it.

498
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,933
Thank you so much.

499
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,033
I happily accept your offer.

500
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:11,700
Boss.

501
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,033
Thank you for everything.

502
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,533
I know we didn't make a profit.

503
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:21,467
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,033
This wasn't about the money.

505
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,533
It's only normal

506
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,700
to want to mend a garment

507
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:36,400
whose owner has given it so much love.

508
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,600
Yes, you're right.

509
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,800
Thank you

510
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,300
for bringing her here.

511
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:55,867
I remember now.

512
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,467
I had no regular customers.

513
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,500
No customers came to the store.

514
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,633
And yet, I still had confidence back then.

515
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:10,967
I had the courage to run this shop.

516
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:17,533
Confidence and courage.

517
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,233
As long as you have those,

518
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,667
you can go on with your work.

519
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,567
Mr. Imai! How have you been?

520
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:41,800
-Long time no see!
-Indeed.

521
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,367
I've come to ask for a favor.

522
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,567
Can I borrow some money?

523
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,500
-What?
-Just a little.

524
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,167
It won't be possible.

525
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,267
Please!

526
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,533
Hey, how are you?

527
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,467
What have you been up to?

528
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,433
-Please!
-Wait up!

529
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,700
-Where's your pride?
-No way!

530
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,000
I have a favor to ask--

531
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,567
-You! What are you doing?
-Will you lend me some money?

532
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,000
Does 7:00 p.m. work?

533
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,133
Thanks.

534
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,067
AMOUNT OWED: 10,000 YEN

535
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,533
Hey, how have you been?

536
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
You surprised me!

537
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,333
Please, just 20,000 yen.

538
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,333
I, Saruhashi,
promise to return the money lent to me...

539
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,500
What kind of man are you?

540
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry!

541
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:26,267
Please, lend me some money!

542
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,933
We didn't get together for your sake.

543
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,067
Please, every little bit will help.

544
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,600
Thanks!

545
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:38,367
You're doing this for women's lingerie?

546
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:39,667
Are you stupid?

547
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Thanks!

548
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:44,933
It really helps!

549
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,967
TOTAL: 640,000 YEN

550
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
What's going on?

551
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:18,833
Is it a party?

552
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,600
Is there something going on today?

553
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:34,667
I apologize for the ruckus.

554
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,700
Welcome.

555
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,400
I came to thank you
for what you did for my mother.

556
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:46,667
Your mother?

557
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:49,733
It seems you mended her lingerie?

558
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,700
Mrs. Ono!

559
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:52,833
Yes.

560
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,467
Recently, she hasn't been well.

561
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,700
She may have been a nuisance to you.

562
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,067
No, not at all.

563
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:00,533
Right?

564
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
She's very spirited and cheerful.

565
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,467
Thank you so much.

566
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,567
Ever since she came here,

567
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,200
she's suddenly become very lively.

568
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,767
Ma'am, I like this one!

569
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,533
Choose whatever you like.

570
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,767
I'll buy whichever one you like.

571
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,833
Thank you so much, ma'am!

572
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,233
Mrs. Ono!

573
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,633
Women should take care of themselves.

574
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,600
You should wear high quality garments.

575
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,133
Yes.

576
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,067
Thank you.

577
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,767
Welcome, Mrs. Ono.

578
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,333
You...

579
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,567
My bra is now so comfortable,
even under my kimono.

580
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,333
You've been wearing it?

581
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,700
Thank you so much.

582
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,367
Yes, it feels wonderful.

583
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,867
It's incredible,

584
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:51,367
considering it's 30 years old.

585
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:54,600
I have better posture when I wear it.

586
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,267
It's as if my husband is telling me

587
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,233
that I need to stand up straight.

588
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,233
Ma'am, look at this one!

589
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,567
Do you think this'll work under a kimono?

590
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,500
I think so.

591
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,767
She wasn't legally married.

592
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,500
She was considered a mistress.

593
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:26,133
She worked hard as a geisha

594
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,900
and raised me all by herself.

595
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:32,200
She slowly collected coins in that purse.

596
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,300
It may not seem like much,

597
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:42,433
but it's her way of expressing gratitude.

598
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,167
I know.

599
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,833
I like that one.

600
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,000
The lace is so pretty.

601
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,133
Yes, it's very pretty.

602
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,200
Eighteen sets all at once!

603
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:04,733
We did it.

604
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,833
I'm not sure what's going on, but yeah!

605
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,567
But we'll need to purchase
a lot of material.

606
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:11,800
We need cash, right?

607
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:14,800
We're going to need cash.

608
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:18,633
Shall we ask for the payment upfront?

609
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,800
No.

610
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,867
We can't do that.

611
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:26,467
I could pay out of my own pocket.

612
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,933
Why don't you hand over your paycheck?

613
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,833
Now that Sosuke quit,
why are you still here?

614
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,233
You guys only pay for my travel expenses.

615
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,667
I don't quite have
the financial means yet.

616
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,733
Where did you get all this?

617
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,167
I borrowed from my ex-girlfriends.

618
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,667
There's about five of them?

619
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:53,400
Women have a soft spot
for men who are in trouble.

620
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,900
If we can get through this,

621
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:00,967
Emotion will make it.

622
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:15,967
It's not much.

623
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,133
But please, use it.

624
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:20,300
Otherwise, I couldn't forgive myself.

625
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:24,100
I allowed Hime to make the sacrifice.

626
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,800
It's heavy.

627
00:42:55,567 --> 00:42:57,167
It must be the weight

628
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:01,133
of the pride you had to set aside.

629
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,600
He must have been so frustrated.

630
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:19,133
Saru.

631
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,633
It was my fault.

632
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,333
Business isn't always pretty.

633
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,000
I thought I could just make and sell

634
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,933
whatever I wanted to.

635
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:44,000
Perhaps I was the presumptuous one.

636
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:05,800
What, you're still here?

637
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,700
Yes.

638
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:12,133
What?

639
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,233
Why are you standing there?

640
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,067
I'm very sorry.

641
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:19,233
For what?

642
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,333
For saying you were just looking away.

643
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:30,533
For telling you to
just express your feelings.

644
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,967
It was stupid of me.

645
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,667
Don't apologize!

647
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:45,767
Don't apologize.

648
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,667
I'm the one who encouraged him.

649
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:51,700
Fujimura.

650
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,300
It's now my responsibility

651
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:58,167
to make things right.

652
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,367
Yes, thank you.

653
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:14,500
We look forward to it.

654
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,367
-I'm heading out.
-See you later.

655
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:26,100
Reiko, is the order form
for Ms. Hashimoto ready?

656
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,867
Yes, it's ready to go.

657
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:30,967
ORDER FORM

658
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:33,400
Lace with glitter.

659
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:34,867
Did we have that in stock?

660
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,067
It's later than I thought.

661
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:50,333
Hello?

662
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,567
Welcome.

663
00:45:56,367 --> 00:46:00,467
I figured it's been too long
since I had something made.

664
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,667
I'm so glad.

665
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,767
Thank you for stopping by!

666
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,500
Thank you so much!

667
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:31,833
Sorry. I didn't hear you.

668
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:33,733
What is it?

669
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:36,967
I'd like to try again.

670
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,867
I want more people to know about Emotion.

671
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,733
Will you let me work on
another second line?

672
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,067
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
