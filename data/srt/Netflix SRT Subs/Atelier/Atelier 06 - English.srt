1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,700
{\an8}This is not good.

2
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,700
Please put this champagne
in the fridge immediately.

3
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:21,533
{\an8}Preferably in a wine cellar.

4
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,000
{\an8}What about the payment?

5
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,967
{\an8}It's already been paid for by Ms. Tokita.

6
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,167
I see.

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,833
This is good stuff, isn't it?

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,900
It was for the guests of the trunk show.

9
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:36,100
Yes, it was flown in from France.

10
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:38,967
Yes, yes! It was flown in.

11
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:43,333
Would a refund still be possible?

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,533
Of course that's not possible!

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
That wasn't for me.

14
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,700
Where would we sell this second line?

15
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,367
Right here.

16
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,100
In this shop.

17
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,233
You're just upset that Story was stolen.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,633
You just want to get revenge!

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,967
And what's wrong with that?

20
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,200
That's not beautiful!

21
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:08,533
Here we go again,
"It's not beautiful."

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,333
Everything's always "not beautiful."
You just say that to shut me up.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,933
You are so--

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,867
Please, cut it out!

25
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,300
We're expecting a customer.

26
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,900
It's like watching a parent and child
bickering.

27
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,200
I don't recall having a child like this!

28
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,133
And I don't recall ever being your child!

29
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,533
We're so glad to see you here again.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,700
It's such a shame that
the trunk show was canceled.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,233
Indeed.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,400
We worked so hard on it.

33
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,767
Yes.

34
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,200
Everything was ready to go.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,500
The new line?

36
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:59,633
I wish I could have seen it.
I was so looking forward to it.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,733
Do you have it here now?

38
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Yes.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,400
Well...

40
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,567
Will you let me see it?

41
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,900
Come this way.

42
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,000
Excuse me.

43
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,100
Wow.

44
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,200
It's beautiful.

45
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,900
Thank you.

46
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm honored to be able to see
President Nanjo's work up close.

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,033
This nightie

48
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,267
is really beautiful.

49
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,333
I wish we could have shown it...

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,000
more properly at the trunk show.

51
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,300
Especially to customers like you,

52
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,700
who truly love Emotion.

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,833
I'm very sorry.

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
No.

FEATURE WRITTEN BY
SHUKO OYAMA

58
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,200
You're like a child,

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,733
getting upset when
things don't go her way.

60
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,433
You want them to admit they're wrong.

61
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,600
You have a strong ego.

62
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:49,900
You said it yourself, boss...

63
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,500
that maybe you were the presumptuous one.

64
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,733
That's right.

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,567
All I'm doing

66
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,800
is giving the business of mass production
the respect it deserves.

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,167
That doesn't mean Emotion is ready to
take on that kind business.

68
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,733
So then, nothing will change.

69
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,833
Is being consistent such a bad thing?

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,967
By remembering how I felt 30 years ago,

71
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,567
I was able to go back to my roots.

72
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,700
But this!

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,933
You want us to just stand back and watch?

74
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,633
We can't just instantly start
a second line.

75
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,800
We have no money or personnel.

76
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,367
You must face the facts.

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,500
I know.

78
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:57,067
And yet, if you were to suppress
your annoyingly persistent feelings,

79
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:59,100
that would really be

80
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,267
a shame!

81
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,433
Don't focus on revenge.

82
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:13,567
Pour all that passion into
something you can do right now.

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
I...

84
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
want everyone to know.

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,867
This shop sells
the most beautiful lingerie

86
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,333
in the entire world.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,367
No matter how beautiful the product is,

88
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,533
if no one knows about it,
it's as if it didn't exist.

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,767
So...

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,167
In these.

91
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,800
In all of these!

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
I'll have them run an article
about Emotion.

{\an8}PUBLIC RELATIONS
MAYUKO TOKITA

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,567
Public relations?

95
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,700
The boss said to do what I wanted,
so I had a card made.

96
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:15,967
Is that weird?

97
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,800
It's a necessary part of a brand.

98
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:18,967
It's a great idea.

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,933
Is that your business card?
I want one.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Here you go.

101
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,433
Your cell number's on it.

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,867
If this is how they play,
I've got a plan too.

103
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:32,967
I'll get Emotion into every magazine.

104
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,367
I'm looking forward to it.

105
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,967
What are you doing?

106
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,633
Supplementary work.
Don't worry about it.

107
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't worry!

108
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,067
Really?

109
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:53,033
Getting materials will be a piece of cake.

110
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,600
So don't worry, Mayu.

111
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,900
Just focus on public relations.

112
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,967
Choosing materials is very important.

113
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,767
I know that!

114
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,533
Do you remember where we first met?

115
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,933
Yeah, you were working in a textile shop.

116
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,300
I've worked longer than you
in the textile business,

117
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,600
so I have some knowledge--

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Are you okay?

119
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,567
What's this?

120
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,467
This?

121
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,800
It's the champagne for the trunk show!

122
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,033
I forgot to cancel the order.

123
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,900
The boss will be so angry.

124
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,033
Don't worry.

125
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,767
I'll take care of it.

126
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,167
What are you going to do?

127
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,033
Story is a nationwide hit.

128
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,233
We've been given the go-ahead
to begin a second production.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,700
Now I see what you were talking about.

130
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:59,633
Whatever the method used to get here,
I feel satisfied with where I'm at.

131
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,833
I'm glad you're onboard.

132
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,733
...Story will be Vanderbilt's main line...

133
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,733
I'm doing PR work now.

So that's why you came by today.

137
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,467
Thank you for coming in.

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
You're the manager of the Ginza shop?

143
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,300
Yes.

144
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,200
Wow.

145
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,933
-That's amazing.
-Thank you.

146
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,967
Since you're the Ginza shop manager,

147
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:49,567
do you have any magazine contacts?

148
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,667
Not at all.

149
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,233
We always deal directly with customers.

150
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,100
Of course.

151
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,700
-I apologize for the sudden question.
-It's okay.

152
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,633
Are you looking to advertise?

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,900
No.

154
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,967
That costs a lot of money.

155
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,633
I was hoping we'd be featured
in an article.

156
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:14,367
But I have no leads with the publishers.

157
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,500
How about <i>Conscious?</i>

158
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,567
I've read many of their lingerie articles.

159
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,733
Perhaps you know someone
on the editorial board?

160
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,200
<i>Conscious.</i>

161
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,333
Yes.

162
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,900
Women are attractive as they are.

00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:53,567
Takeuchi is currently out of the office.

166
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,567
Did you have an appointment?

167
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,400
No. Thank you.
I'll come back.

168
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,333
Hello.

169
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,900
Ms. Oyama.

170
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,100
What are you doing here?

171
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,567
Well...

172
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,400
Well, you should probably call

173
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,133
and make an appointment first.

174
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,600
And speak to Ms. Nagai,
the editor-in-chief.

175
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,300
I'll let her know as well.

176
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,167
Thank you.

177
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,567
You'll just have to talk to them
one at a time.

178
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:31,433
I have a friend...

179
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,733
Well, maybe that's not quite right.

180
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,600
Any introduction would help.

181
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,933
It's a magazine for teens.

182
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,333

00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,300
Looks great!

186
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,700
Now hold that pose.

187
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,667
Wonderful.

188
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,000
Now with more energy.

189
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,333
Great, great.

190
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,667
Looks good, Mari.

191
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,133
Are you looking for someone?

192
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,700
Yes.

193
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,833
I have an appointment with Ms. Nishio.

194
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,633
I was told she's here?

195
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,700
Thanks, everyone!

196
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,233
Great work!

197
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,267
Yumi and Chi were so cute!

198
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,300
And so was Mari!

199
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,967
Ms. Sawada!

200
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,700
Is that...

201
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,233
It's the new line!

202
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,667
All brand new!

203
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,300
It's so cute!

204
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,867
Look!

205
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,000
We've got five different colors.

206
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:57,067
It suits you perfectly, Mari.

207
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,933
We thought you might like one.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,533
We can really have this?

209
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,900
I love Grazia's bags!

210
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,867
They're all yours!

211
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,967
Mari, that color looks great on you!

212
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,100
Try carrying it!

213
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,600
Mayu?

214
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,567
Sari?

215
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,700
Are you here for work?

216
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,433
Yes. I just passed an audition.

217
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,967
Congratulations!

218
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,100
What about you?

219
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,400
-Sari?
-Yes.

220
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,133
Gotta go.
Let's go for lunch sometime.

221
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Good luck!

222
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,100
Excuse me.

223
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,867
Do you work in the industry?

224
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,033
Please take these if you'd like.

225
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,367
No!

226
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,767

VIVAN MASATO ONO 03...

229
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,933
Of course not.

230
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,200
Did you get to meet the editor?

231
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,733
{\an8}Yes, but it's a magazine for teens,
so Emotion's not really aimed at them.

232
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,867
That's true.

233
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,100
It creates custom-made lingerie.

234
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,300
But I was so surprised.

235
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,867
It wasn't just that brand.

236
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,033
Other brand representatives
kept coming by!

237
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,833
And they'd leave their products.

238
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,767
Having models use the products
is the quickest way to sell.

239
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,633
It doesn't cost any money.

240
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
Money?

241
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:23,567
Models take pictures of themselves
to put on their blogs.

242
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,767
And on social media.

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
If we can see even a glimpse
of their clothing or their bag,

244
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,067
it sells out the next day.

245
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,567
Sells out?

246
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:36,267
Women buy out of desire.

247
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,333
I guess that's true.

248
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,667
Someone I know said that before.

249
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,367
So then, they understand.

250
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:55,167
Even top brands get their PR people to
make sure celebrities carry their product.

251
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,067
I see.

252
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,067
But Emotion can't do that.

253
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:02,967
Right.

254
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,367
So a magazine is probably the way to go.

255
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,667
Especially one of the higher-class ones.

256
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,400
Like <i>Conscious,</i> for example?

257
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,367
Then again,
bloggers are more influential now.

258
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
What?

259
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,467
Nothing.

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,767
Miki, you never told us,

261
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,900
do you work in the fashion industry
or something?

262
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,000
What?

263
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,633
What is it?

264
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,733
Sorry.

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,067
What is it?

266
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,133
Is there anything in there

267
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,067
that could even interest you,
Mr. Yamazaki?

268
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,567
This is...

269
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,667
My daughter!

270
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,800
What?

00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,867

16 YEARS OLD

273
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,967
{\an8}She's cute!

274
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,167
No way!

275
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:03,067
For part two of Story,
we will be going with the concept, Flower.

276
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,767
Our production goal is 40,000 units.

277
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,867
We'll introduce the product
at the Ginza store.

278
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,967
We'll use Ms. Nishikawa as the model--

279
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,633
Hold on a second.

280
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,967
When was this decided?

281
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,367
At last week's meeting.

282
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,300
Considering the marketing team's numbers,

283
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,900
and the concept for the next term
at Vanderbilt's,

284
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,100
the development team--

285
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,700
I haven't heard anything about it.

286
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,433
We're the designers, right?

287
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,967
I think it's a great idea!

288
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,533
"Flower" is a very feminine concept.

289
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,333
We're short on time, so shall we?

290
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:53,233
SAMPLE IMAGES

291
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,333
What are these?

292
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,433
They're from another brand
with a similar concept.

293
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,567
They're selling well,
so we can analyze the design.

294
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,333
Analyze?

295
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,267
SAMPLE IMAGES

296
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,100
These!

297
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:15,300
They're great, aren't they?

298
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,867
It would be wonderful
if we could make ours more like these.

299
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,900
We're counting on you.

300
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,867
It's just business.

301
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:37,833
Mr. Fujimura!

302
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,233
Mizuki!

303
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,767
I know what you're going to say.

304
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,633
Was this your plan all along?

305
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:57,467
Story was Emotion's trunk show theme.

306
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,733
You stole it, didn't you?

307
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,933
It doesn't matter now!

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,633
If I can just do my job,

309
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,400
I won't say anything
about what's already done.

310
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,833
I'll even go along with your concept.

311
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,100
But this is not right!

312
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm not President Nanjo.

313
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:22,333
Story is not Emotion.

314
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,833
That's fine.

315
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,700
Feel free to do as you like.

316
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,433
Ignore the concept,
as well as the marketing team,

317
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,533
and design whatever you want.

318
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
But...

319
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,000
Make something that sells.

320
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:55,233
After all, Story is not Emotion.

321
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,800
It's the new line for November.

322
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,167
Please, take it.

323
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
What's it like?

324
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:29,533
Hello, it's been a while.

325
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,867
I apologize for any trouble
I've caused you in the past.

326
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,200
You're looking better.

327
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,600
It still needs work.

328
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,367
I came here today

329
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,667
to give you this.

330
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Emotion makes lingerie, right?

331
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:54,233
A camisole?

332
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,067
It's a nightie.

333
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:00,833
I see.

334
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:04,533
It's pretty.
It's what I'd expect from Emotion.

335
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,933
Thank you.

336
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,400
We thought that if you wore it,

337
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,300
you could feel its quality.

338
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:15,900
Takeuchi?

339
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes?

340
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,133
What do you think?

341
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,467
What do you mean?

342
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,900
Are you imagining me in it?

343
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,033
Should I?
Or shouldn't I?

344
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,633
It's creepy either way.

345
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,800
This isn't really my style.

346
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,700
So what's your budget?

347
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,533
Budget?

348
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,433
I'm not here to discuss advertisement.

349
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,333
I'd like for you to write
an article about us.

350
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,067
A tie-up?

351
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,500
Then you should discuss the budget
with the ad agency.

352
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,300
We'll have a storyboard,
but we'll have the final say

353
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:06,800
on the product and the story.

354
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:08,867
Well.

355
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,333
What do you mean by budget?

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Takeuchi?

358
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,033
Hello, Ms. Akibara?

359
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:28,100
There's a limit to one's ignorance.

360
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,533
What?

361
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,833
You want Emotion on the cover?

362
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,700
Yes, please.

363
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,733
Then you need to pay what they paid.

364
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,133
What?

365
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:50,067
I'm sure the price is two digits more than
what you would have imagined.

366
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,200
Can you afford it?

367
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Excuse me.

368
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,633
Excuse me!

369
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,767
I met Ms. Tokita the other day.

370
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,267
So Emotion is finally doing PR?

371
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,533
How much?

372
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,567
Story was featured in every magazine.

373
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,533
How much did you get?

374
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:30,000
That's not it.

375
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:37,100
Vanderbilt's paid out
all the publishing companies.

376
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:44,033
And I suppose the writers
just have to write what they're told.

377
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,933
"Beautiful and strong,

378
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,167
yet light and graceful.

379
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:54,567
Story is an expression of today's woman.

380
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:59,167
These two facets are the epitome
of the modern woman."

381
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't read it out loud.

382
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,733
You don't have to show it to me!

383
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,100
What crap!

384
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,667
This article.

385
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,067
It has the same pictures
and the same story

386
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,000
as every other magazine.

387
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:14,067
It's just empty praises,
urging everyone to buy the product.

388
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:19,000
Is that what's expected
of a lingerie critic, Shuko Oyama?

389
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:22,467
I've adapted to the times.

390
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,633
No location scouting, no interviews.

391
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,333
There's nothing about
what you actually saw and felt.

392
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,933
How can you call yourself a critic?

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You're right.

394
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
But...

395
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,100
That's why you're stuck.

396
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,700
Always doing what's right
won't win you any votes.

397
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,700
You're setting up your own obstacles.

398
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,167
Ms. Tokita?

399
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,533
So you went to <i>Conscious?</i>

400
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Yes.

401
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:23,867
Can I show off a little?

402
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:25,767
What?

403
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:30,400
Concerning our sales
from last year and this year,

404
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,133
I came in first in my company.

405
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,033
Wow.

406
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,800
Everyone at the Ginza store does well.

407
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:45,167
It helps that we get a lot of customers
from other Asian countries.

408
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,933
I didn't do it all on my own.

409
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:54,400
But if a product sells really well,

410
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,833
I feel as though it was thanks to me.

411
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,733
The company even rewards me for it.

412
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,933
And yet, all I did
was deal with customers.

413
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,867
But I feel as though I created the trend,

414
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:09,367
that I'm somehow influencing people.

415
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:13,967
When really,
it's simply a financial transaction.

416
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:17,900
The truth is,

417
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,067
Emotion has the most honest way
of doing business.

418
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,100
You were right, boss.

419
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:17,100
If you're looking for a way to sell
a high-quality product honestly,

420
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,733
Emotion has the finest business model.

421
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,700
If you don't have any money,

422
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:34,333
then you can't get this magazine to print
even a single word about you.

423
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,367
Boss,

424
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,300
you're right.

425
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:47,433
Do we only want to be right?

426
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:50,933
Mr. Saruhashi.

427
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:05,300
"For women to have the luxury
of choosing their lingerie."

428
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:09,200
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

429
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:13,633
We can raise the money.

430
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,800
Here are the forms to submit
to a finance company.

431
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:21,033
{\an8}APPLICATION

432
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,867
{\an8}The lawsuit's been settled.

433
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,700
We can now get a loan.

434
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,267
But only if you agree to it.

435
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:32,667
I...

436
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,100
want a second line as well.

437
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
<i>Mr. Saruhashi?</i>

438
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah.

439
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:47,333
He worked out the financing on his own.

440
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,467
And he said he wants a second line.

441
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,700
I was so surprised.

442
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:54,500
What did the boss say?

443
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:58,933
I see.

444
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,933
"Mass production is not easy."

445
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,867
I get it now.

446
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:11,433
I can't believe Mizuki and Fumika!

447
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,433
I'm only here part-time, but I'm upset!

448
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,000
I think that they knew.

449
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,700
About money. About people.

450
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,300
They knew the timing was right.

451
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,133
Still.

452
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah.

453
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,800
Wanna go somewhere?

454
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,367
What?

455
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,167
I just meant if you were hungry.

456
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:50,100
I don't have any ulterior motives.

457
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:53,833
Shall we go then?

458
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,733
I'm so full!

459
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,033
You're so friendly with everyone, Kaji.

460
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,933
That chef was hilarious.

461
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,467
He told terrible jokes!

462
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,733
I finally got to hang out with you.

463
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,033
I feel as though I have more energy
after having laughed so much.

464
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:27,100
I'm glad to hear that.

465
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,767
By any chance,

466
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,933
have you spoken with Sosuke lately?

467
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,900
What?

468
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,467
What?

469
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I mean...

470
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,867
I haven't. Why?

471
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,767
Because...

472
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,167
I'm sorry.

473
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,433
Never mind.

474
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,433
You know, I'm not--

475
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,167
No really! Never mind.

476
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,733
Okay, let's get back to work!

477
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,133
Hold on.

478
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,033
I think you're right.

479
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,333
No matter how beautiful the product is,

480
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,233
if no one knows about it,
it's as if it didn't exist.

481
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,500
So...

482
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,400
I want to help.

483
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,500
Make something that sells.

484
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,933
It's just business.

485
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:01,033
<i>After all, Story is not Emotion.</i>

486
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,433
You're still here?

487
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,300
Why is this so wrinkled?

488
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,400
That's strange.

489
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:51,267
Growing old is not very pleasant.

490
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,100
Why the sudden remark?

491
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,333
I can barely keep up with change and yet,

492
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,900
I'm over 50 and still trying to figure out
how to grow up.

493
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,533
It's so unattractive.
I hate it.

494
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:10,000
What's wrong with that?

495
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,267
If you have nothing left to learn,

496
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,800
you end up being like
dried-up seaweed left on a shelf.

497
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,400
What kind of analogy is that?

498
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:26,633
And the kids here are learning from you.

499
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,300
How are you?

500
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:11,633
Fine.

501
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,033
Thanks to you.

502
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,167
Thanks to me?

503
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:20,433
Sarcasm?

504
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:23,967
Yes.

505
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,200
And you?

506
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,600
Are you happy to have your own brand?

507
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,667
I feel satisfied.

508
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,333
That's unfortunate.

509
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,533
What?

510
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,367
The concepts and designs,

511
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,767
had you done them all yourself,

512
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,233
you could have been happier.

513
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,900
I can do that.

514
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,267
From now on.

515
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:01,233
I understand.

516
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,233
You had no choice
if you wanted it to sell.

517
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,400
Everyone does things
thinking they don't have a choice.

518
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,367
What a stubborn woman.

519
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:21,400
What?

520
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,033
President Nanjo.

521
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:29,367
Outspoken, willful and very tenacious.

522
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:30,533
That's true.

523
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:35,500
But...

524
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,533
I believe she's the real deal.

525
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,967
That's why I want to find a way to sell

526
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:48,400
without compromising how I feel.

527
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,167
You can have Story.

528
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:59,100
It's just one idea out of many.

529
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,333
That's why I'm apologizing!

530
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,500
Now you're upset?

531
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,400
You feel entitled
just because you're young?

532
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:23,333
I was the one who hid it. I'm sorry.

533
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,633
I was the one who forgot to cancel.

534
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,367
It's not your fault that you forgot,
it was bad timing.

535
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,267
But what is this?

536
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,933
1,000 YEN PER PERSON

537
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,633
What if a bunch of
perverted old men show up?

538
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,100
We won't get any new customers
if we don't do this.

539
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,233
That's right!

540
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,167
I think it's a great idea.

541
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:42,333
I'd definitely come.

542
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,867
That's the problem.

543
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,000
Then we'll come up with something else.

544
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,233
Getting more customers is what matters.

545
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,533
That's exactly right.

546
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,167
A trunk show isn't enough.

547
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:56,033
We need something to bring in a new crowd.

548
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,600
Otherwise, we can't beat Story.

549
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,700
I don't care about Story anymore!

550
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,433
I don't want to think about it.

551
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,867
Besides, this champagne...

552
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,933
Mizuki.

553
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,500
Please.

554
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:55,267
Let me work here.

555
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
What?

556
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,833
What did you say?

557
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:01,967
Am I hearing you right?

558
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:06,367
I don't deserve it.

559
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,067
I know that.

560
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:15,467
No matter what,
I have no right to enter this store.

561
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,967
I know that, but,

562
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,567
I had to come.

563
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:26,567
I couldn't turn that corner near here.

564
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,767
I've walked this path so many times.

565
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,400
But my feet wouldn't move.

566
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,600
I kept walking back and forth.

567
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,400
It doesn't matter what you felt.

568
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,967
"What am I doing?

569
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:44,667
It's the path I chose,"
and I'd try to leave.

570
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:46,033
But then,

571
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,333
my feet would move this way on their own.

572
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:52,567
My body feels torn apart.

573
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,900
I don't know what to do.

574
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:03,300
But one thing is clear to me.

575
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,333
I can't come up with any ideas.

576
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,633
I claimed I would only design
what I wanted,

577
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:21,000
and I was told to do just that.

578
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,333
And yet,

579
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,633
I just can't seem to
come up with anything.

580
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,667
"What would the boss do?

581
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,333
This kind of looks like what she'd do.

582
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,533
The boss wouldn't like this, the boss..."

583
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,233
What it comes down to...

584
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,467
is that your designs are what I like best.

585
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,533
I don't ask that you forgive me.

586
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
Please let me work here again.

587
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,367
I'll do anything!

588
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,367
The trunk show back in April...

589
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
Will you stop that?

590
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:37,700
Look at me.

591
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,633
At the trunk show in April...

592
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,167
I realize it now.

593
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:54,100
I should have used your designs.

594
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:58,900
They were well done.

595
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,867
It would have represented Emotion well.

596
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:11,967
It was wrong of me to drop it.

597
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,700
I regret it.

598
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,733
I'm so sorry.

599
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,033
Shall we do a second line then?

600
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Creating a second line
would be much better

601
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,633
than doing something like this!

602
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:56,500
Saru?

603
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,000
We've got the funds, right?

604
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,333
Yes.

605
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,233
And we've got a persistent PR person.

606
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,733
And an optimistic part-timer.

607
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,300
And someone who's supported us for years,

608
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,533
our very sweet veteran.

609
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,567
We've got a designer.

610
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,733
We've failed twice now.

611
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:29,600
But I think we can do it this time.

612
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:34,233
However,

613
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,833
I'm going to sell as honestly as possible.

614
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:50,767
Let's do it.

615
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:53,833
Who cares what others say,
let's do it right!

616
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,800
Don't speak as if others didn't like us!

617
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:56,967
Do they?

618
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:59,900
Why shouldn't they?
I'm such a sweet person.

619
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,667
I see.

620
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,300
Very well, then.

621
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:08,833
Let's drink.

622
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,300
It's on me, the very sweet boss.

623
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,733
Let's chill it.

624
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm glad.

625
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:38,467
No.

626
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:40,667
She's too cute.

627
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,300
What?

628
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,667
It was Fujimura, wasn't it?

629
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:02,533
I'm going to beat him.

630
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,367
Excuse me?

631
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:12,700
Yes, I'm coming.

632
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:18,233
Ms. Hiromi Tsukamoto.

633
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Hello.

634
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:23,033
I know it's past closing time
but your light was on.

635
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,400
Please, come in!

636
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:28,033
Boss!

637
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,600
Hello.

638
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:31,700
Hello.

639
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,500
I brought this.

640
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,100
Thank you so much.

641
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm so happy!

642
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,567
This really makes me happy.

643
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:46,100
But it's only 2,500 yen.

644
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,933
It's wonderful, isn't it, boss?

645
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,733
How much have you already had to drink?

646
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,067
This is the kind of customer we want.

647
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,333
Right, boss?

648
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,167
I know, calm down.

649
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:01,667
We want you to see more lingerie.

650
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,667
Not in magazines like this, but more...

651
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:10,267
Boss, let's do a show!

652
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,133
What?

653
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:20,000
Good. Very good.

654
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:41,167
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
