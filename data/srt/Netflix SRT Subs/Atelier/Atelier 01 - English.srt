1
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,033
Perfect.

2
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,533
Time to go.

3
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:33,167
POLYESTER - SILK - COTTON
MODAL - TRIACETATE

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,533
Silk, okay.

5
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,467
ISHIKAWA TAILOR

6
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,033
Mayu!

7
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,967
Yuri.

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,933
I knew it.
You forgot.

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,633
Sorry.

10
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,333
We were supposed to have tea before work.

11
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,467
You should have called me.

12
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,233
Well, I hit it off
with a guy sitting next to me.

13
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,267
We started talking,
and time flew by.

14
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,400
Friends already?

15
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,767
I'm starting to feel like
I can make it here.

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,667
Hey, do I look okay? I had a really
hard time deciding what to wear.

17
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,967
-Do I look weird? Like a hick?
-No.

18
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:08,900
You look like you've made an effort.
You'll make a good impression.

19
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,800
Can't you just say I look cute?

20
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:15,500
You know,
we studied textile at college,

21
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,800
and you chose to wear that
on your first day?

22
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,033
What?

23
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,533
But it's a suit.

24
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,833
Well, whatever.

25
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,733
Oh, my office is this way.
Bye.

26
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,267
We're off to a good start
on our new lives!

27
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,300
We won't let Tokyo stop us!

28
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,733
I'll e-mail you later.

29
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,167
AZUMA INARI SHRINE

30
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,133
Good morning.

31
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,067
-Good morning.
-Morning.

32
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,633
-The new hire?
-Ms. Tokita.

33
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Found this place all right?

34
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,967
I'm Mayuko Tokita.
Pleased to meet you.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,333
Um, am I late?

36
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
It's not that.
Just--

37
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,533
Ms. Tokita. You just got here,
but I need to give you a task.

38
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,067
Yes.

39
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:31,167
Could you take this fabric sample
to Sekiguchi in Nippori?

40
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,267
I'll give you the address.
It's a fabric store.

41
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,033
Nippori, the fabric district.

42
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,967
Sorry for rushing you like this.

43
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,200
-Hime.
-Yes?

44
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,733
-Give her the map.
-Okay.

45
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,367
Sorry for the chaos.
We're having a trunk show this weekend.

46
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,767
-Trunk show?
-Unveiling of our new products.

47
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,800
{\an8}We'll put on a show here in the store.

48
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,133
{\an8}2015 FALL-WINTER PRODUCT LAUNCH

49
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,833
-Hey, photos of the fitting?
-Yes.

50
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Sorry about that.

51
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,667
Isn't this gorgeous?

52
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,267
These walk right in front of you.
Heaven for men.

53
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,467
Right?

54
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,633
I look at those strictly
from a professional--

55
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,867
You are mumbling.

56
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,800
-Stop fooling around.
-Mizuki's edgy.

57
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,633
It's her debut.

58
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Changed your style too, right?

59
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:15,733
She designs shapes first.
Straight as an arrow.

60
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,967
Say what you like.
I'm staking my whole life on this.

61
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,767
Hurry up.

62
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,033
I'm off.

63
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Wait, the map!

64
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,167
Design change?
We only have five days.

65
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,333
THESE THREE DESIGNS WILL BE CHANGED
FOR THE APRIL 11 TRUNK SHOW

66
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,533
Ah, the design change,
as expected.

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,900
The boss seemed
to be in that kind of mood.

68
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,733
And what's more,
three of them!

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,433
Only five days until the show.

70
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,600
Well, what's that saying?

71
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,467
Nothing new.
We'll just move on.

72
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,733
Fumi, do we have the new designs?

73
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,067
Um...
We have two out of the three.

74
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,500
All these are my design.

75
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,333
She came up with something, again.

76
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,433
So we'll make these two,
and the last one...

77
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,233
We'll just wait.

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,433
NEW HIRE
TRUNK SHOW

79
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,467
Will she change the staging too?

80
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,333
Talk to the boss.

81
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
I don't think she'll change that.

82
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,333
We can't postpone it now.

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,700
We've already sent out the invitation.

84
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,933
We'll go on with the show on the 11th.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,667
That's our schedule.

86
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,733
Okay.

87
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,133
-Give it to me.
-Yes.

88
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,700
I'm sure you'll go through a lot,

89
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,100
but we'll do this together, okay?

90
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,133
Okay.

91
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,167
"Emotion is a made-to-order
lingerie maker.

92
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,200
We take detailed measurements
of our customers,

93
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,967
listen to their requests,

94
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:03,700
and make the one and only lingerie
in the world for each of them.

95
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:07,733
So, these are just images
that our president Mayumi Nanjo offers.

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,933
They're not for sale."

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,900
Perfect.

98
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,600
I couldn't say it so smoothly.

99
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:18,467
These are called haute couture, right?

100
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,967
Well, strictly speaking,
they're not.

101
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,100
They're one of a kind.

102
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,733
Lavish, isn't it?

103
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,667
It's really amazing,
creating all the way from fabric.

104
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,033
Indeed.

105
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,700
What, fabric?

106
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,367
I'm so excited.
I studied textile at college.

107
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,700
It's my dream to develop new materials
like microfiber or carbon fiber.

108
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,967
Wait.
We don't develop new fabrics.

109
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:47,733
Huh?

110
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,267
But Ms. Nanjo said we create
from scratch.

111
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,333
I think you have the wrong idea
about our job.

112
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,200
You should have a talk with her.

113
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,400
That's her atelier.

114
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,567
This material...

115
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,200
Bare jersey made with rayon
and polyurethane.

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,900
Stretchable and so sleek.

117
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,733
I'm in heaven!

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Quite a soliloquist.

119
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,833
Ms. Nanjo...
Good morning.

120
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,933
You're cute.

121
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,400
I envy young girls.
They don't need any effort to be cute.

122
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,467
Such radiant, firm skin.

123
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,700
What do you eat to keep it?

124
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,233
No, I'm wrong.

125
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,467
It doesn't matter what you eat.

126
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:03,067
You eat salty and greasy food to death,
but it stays smooth.

127
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,933
I'll bet mosquitoes just slide off it.
Nowhere for them to bite.

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,833
Just joking.

129
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,700
What's good about that fabric?

130
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,000
That.
Rayon bare jersey.

131
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh. Um...

132
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:21,367
Stretchable,
produces great colors,

133
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,300
and absorbs moisture well,
very functional as underwear.

134
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,467
Very soft texture.

135
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,300
Processed to prevent shrinkage,

136
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,167
-so it's washable--
-Bad things?

137
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,767
-It's heavy.
-So knowledgeable.

138
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm Mayuko Tokita.
Thank you for hiring me.

139
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,333
But...

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,233
may I ask you a question?

141
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:48,667
At the interview, I heard I could
develop fabrics that can be used--

142
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,967
But too bad.
You're tacky.

143
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,867
You have firm and smooth skin,
you know a lot about fabrics.

144
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,433
But you're tacky.

145
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,733
Grossly tacky.

146
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,667
Stand two meters away from me.

147
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,133
Pardon?

148
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,033
Women who don't care about beauty
make me want to punch them.

149
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,167
Okay, okay.
I'll take care of her.

150
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,533
I was going to ask you to run an errand.

151
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,400
You're going shopping in Ginza.
It'll be fun!

152
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,867
Thank you very much.
Give my regards to Ms. Nanjo.

153
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,467
I hope the show is a success.

154
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,433
Thanks.

155
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:33,733
Wait.

156
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,633
I'm a regular customer of Emotion too.

157
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,433
That's...
Thank you very much.

158
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,233
Sorry for my outfit.

159
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:55,333
Please tell Ms. Nanjo I'll let her know
when we get more good stuff.

160
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,767
Okay.

161
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:06,867
Here's the Raphael Collin's piece
Ms. Nanjo ordered.

162
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:12,467
Those shoes look comfortable.

163
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:19,100
I'm a working woman.
These shoes are perfect.

164
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,167
Huh?

165
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,433
Sorry for being tacky.

166
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,167
What's so wrong with this outfit?

167
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,967
I hate this town!

168
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,033
Something like this,
in green this time.

169
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,800
I'll gather up torchon laces for you.

170
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,200
7,000 yen...

171
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,000
70,000!

172
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,500
{\an8}MRS. MUROI
PURCHASE AMOUNT

173
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,833
-So, the trunk show is this Saturday.
-Yes.

174
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,233
Most brands have already finished
showing their fall-winter collection.

175
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,600
What delayed your show?

176
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,400
Any issues with you, Ms. Nanjo?

177
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,233
No particular reason.

178
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,167
Everyone's wondering.

179
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,633
"What will Mayumi Nanjo create next?"

180
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,933
It determines the lingerie trend in Japan.

181
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,100
I, for one, keep doing this job
just to see your new creation.

182
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,367
I'm very flattered.

183
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,167
But I'm a little worried.

184
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:47,633
I can attest to the fact that Emotion's
lingerie is the best of the world,

185
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,233
but today your products are
more like traditional craft than fashion.

186
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,600
You did not just say that.

187
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,867
You're welcome.

188
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:03,500
I make the same things again and again?
It's none of your concern.

189
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:07,267
A critic should not meddle with
a maker's creative process.

190
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,800
All you need to do is evaluate
the finished products.

191
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:14,700
It's always a critic with good eyes
that leads the culture.

192
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,967
Wanna hear more? You're in a rut.
No novelty.

193
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,367
Laces, silk, embroidery, silk again.

194
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:22,533
Shut up, you noisy hag.

195
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,300
We're two of a kind.

196
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:28,800
Well, okay, let's stop there.
Please, Shuko--

197
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,933
Quiet, Saru.

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,167
Listen, I have only one criterion,

199
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,633
and that's whether it's beautiful or not.

200
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,267
And what makes it beautiful

201
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,400
is not just design or how it looks.

202
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:45,433
Top class material,
elaborate patterns,

203
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,300
high-quality sewing,

204
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,133
maximum comfort,

205
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,233
reasonable prices,
customer satisfaction.

206
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,000
Only the products that have all of these
can be called beautiful.

207
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:59,800
-But--
-Novelty? What's novelty?

208
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,600
No one knows what it will be.

209
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,533
Don't expect us to be new.

210
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,300
I have made and will always make
only beautiful products.

211
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,333
Big mouth, as always.

212
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,633
Okay, let's wrap it up then.

213
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,233
Looking forward to the trunk show.

214
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,600
It's rare

215
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,667
to see you in such distress.

216
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,200
I am aware of all the noise around me.

217
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:47,000
You've been an icon
in the lingerie industry for 30 years.

218
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,167
You wanna quit?

219
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,367
Did I say such a thing?

220
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,033
Organize the stockroom.

221
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,067
It's so messy.

222
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,500
That's why my head is messy inside too.

223
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,967
These are...

224
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:28,233
I feel so at home!

225
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,100
Straps, adjusters...

226
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,567
Loops go there.
Good, perfect.

227
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,067
Such a soliloquist.

228
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,333
Tough first day, isn't it?

229
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
Wish we could give you a welcome party.

230
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,533
It's okay.
I love doing this.

231
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,100
Better than a welcome party
or a drinking party.

232
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,600
A hundred times better.

233
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,167
You're funny.

234
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:00,933
Mayuko Tokita. Where did you
go to college? Oh, yeah, Nagano.

235
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,100
What are you doing with those?

236
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,600
-Throwing them away.
-Why?

237
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:06,967
They're very nice.

238
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:10,100
This silk is among the best.

239
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,233
No matter how good they are,

240
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,467
we never put them out
if the boss is dissatisfied.

241
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,200
That's our motto.

242
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,233
Hello, um...
New girl!

243
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,433
The boss?
Yes!

244
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,100
Bring me coffee.

245
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,800
Okay!

246
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,267
-You don't mind that?
-What?

247
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,200
Drink whatever you like.

248
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,267
Fits for a fashionable office.

249
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,667
It's not so rare though.

250
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,867
Fumi, has the boss
given you the new design?

251
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:49,033
Not yet.
She's never been this late before.

252
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,533
Right.

253
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,233
She must be so shocked.

254
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,933
This trunk show was the first time
her design was chosen.

255
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,133
Three of them.
But then...

256
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,633
That thing this morning?

257
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:13,200
Samples had already been made,
but all of them were scrapped.

258
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:17,300
The ones Mr. Saruhashi threw away...

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,367
You're bringing coffee to the boss, right?

260
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,500
This is the only kind she drinks.

261
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,567
Thank you, er, Hime...

262
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:28,000
Call me Sosuke.

263
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:31,900
-You're acting superior.
-I'm not!

264
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,200
-I'll show you how to drip brew--
-I know how.

265
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,967
My father loves drip brew.

266
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:26,967
It's good.

267
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,567
You're good at brewing coffee.

268
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,767
Thank you very much.

269
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,833
You're a woman, right?

270
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,667
Tell me what "dissemble" means.

271
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:42,033
Um, well...

272
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:47,300
To adorn only what can be seen

273
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,667
and hide the true nature,

274
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,767
to pretend to be something else.

275
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,800
You're right.
But it can also mean...

276
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,467
to spruce yourself up nicely
according to time and place,

277
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,367
strive to make yourself fit,

278
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,100
and try not to give discomfort to others.

279
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:11,267
Now that you're here,
learn to dissemble like a woman.

280
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,167
You give me discomfort.

281
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,133
You know why?

282
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,333
Because you're not beautiful.

283
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,300
You're right.
I'm not beautiful.

284
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:35,300
If you like beautiful women so much,
hire a super-stylish model!

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,033
Excuse me.

286
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,133
Sorry for interrupting.

287
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,967
Next.

288
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,733
Stand there.

289
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,067
So sleek.

290
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:59,900
I'll bet the water just runs off your skin
after a shower.

291
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:05,800
Models for the trunk show.
The boss hand-picks them.

292
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,200
Face to the right.

293
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,933
Face back to me.

294
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,067
Here it is.
I'm sorry, but you're not hired.

295
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,967
Of course.

296
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:47,033
I can't land a job if I faint like that.

297
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:52,767
So hungry.

298
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,833
I haven't eaten for three days.

299
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,633
To keep my stomach flat.

300
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,533
But you're already beautiful.

301
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,833
Why?

302
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,867
I'm back.

303
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,633
Mizuki?

304
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,233
Ah, 1.2 million yen of product cost...

305
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,600
1.2 million?

306
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Don't worry.

307
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,767
-See you tomorrow.
-Yes...

308
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,533
You can go home too.

309
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,500
<i>You give me discomfort.</i>

310
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,800
<i>Because you're not beautiful.</i>

311
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,733
FOUR DAYS TILL TRUNK SHOW

312
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,533
Good morning.
Sorry I'm late.

313
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,733
Good morning.

314
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,100
Wow.
Same outfit as yesterday.

315
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,867
Not only young and firm,
but also stubborn.

316
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,900
Youthfulness is a scary thing.

317
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm sorry.
I fell asleep here.

318
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,700
I need to emulate your strong spirit.

319
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:59,567
I'm so pure-minded and wimpy.

320
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:02,233
"Says who?" Saruhashi,
you just thought that, didn't you?

321
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,933
-Boss, the last design--
-Not yet.

322
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,533
This is not good.

323
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,533
Then we'll do the trunk show
with just what we have.

324
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,000
One less item
won't affect the staging much.

325
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,767
Then it's the same as before.

326
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
We have to show progress.

327
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,200
A surprise at the end.

328
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,200
Or we'll cancel the show.

329
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:23,700
We can't do that!

330
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,333
Then shut your mouth!

331
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:28,233
Why?

332
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:36,333
We had products finished on time.

333
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,100
So why are we making new ones?

334
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,033
What's wrong with this one?

335
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,567
Hey, Ms. Tokita--

336
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,700
The material is hygroscopic cupro,

337
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,500
regenerated fiber
made with natural materials.

338
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,067
Thin and delicate,
ideal for underwear.

339
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,700
Cups are silk

340
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,800
of very high quality.

341
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,600
Wonder how many hands
went through to make it.

342
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,833
So why?

343
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,667
Why does it have to be cut to pieces?

344
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,733
Why can't this be in the show?

345
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,367
Because it's not beautiful.

346
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,033
That...

347
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:26,667
is in the eye of the beholder.

348
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,200
I think it's very beautiful.

349
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:34,033
Don't use the word "beautiful" lightly.

350
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,700
This doesn't meet Emotion's standards.

351
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:42,633
Also, you don't meet
our company's standards.

352
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,633
Emotion's not just a lingerie maker

353
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,833
but a leader that maintains
the highest standard of beauty.

354
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:56,533
As such,
we can't be insensitive to beauty.

355
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,467
What is beauty?

356
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,433
Underwear touches people's skin.

357
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,533
So hygroscopicity,
elasticity,

358
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,100
weight and allergy sensitivity
must be considered.

359
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:14,500
In other words,
functionality is what's most important.

360
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,867
There's no room for beauty there.

361
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,467
Are decorations
like lace really necessary?

362
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:24,533
To throw away 1.2 million yen
for a slight design change

363
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,200
is absurd!

364
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,300
Debauchery of the rich!

365
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,800
You don't show off your underwear.

366
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,333
-Why in the--
-What a big mouth.

367
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,133
I'm so sorry.
I apologize.

368
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,467
Forgive me for being rude.

369
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,667
Wait.

370
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,433
Finish your speech.

371
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,167
"Why in the..."

372
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,467
Why in the world

373
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,767
do women have to

374
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,167
try to be beautiful?

375
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:12,033
Styling our hair,

376
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:14,967
choosing cute clothes,

377
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,100
taking time to put on makeup.

378
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,633
Why wear expensive lingerie

379
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,800
and make our breasts look bigger
and our body look sleek?

380
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:28,133
Why do women have to dress up themselves
and look beautiful?

381
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,433
It's absurd!

382
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,200
It's so unreasonable!

383
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,633
Follow me.

384
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:03,733
Look at this.

385
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,500
Throughout human history,

386
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:12,733
in Asia, Africa, North and South America,

387
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,933
and of course Europe,

388
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,367
all women,

389
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:19,100
in every age and every place,

390
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,367
have been trying to be beautiful

391
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,233
all through their existence.

392
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:29,000
And humans have been admiring
the beauty of women.

393
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,400
Your questions are nonsense.

394
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,600
The human history

395
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:39,933
is the answer.

396
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,633
Perfect place to mope.

397
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,600
I'm really sorry.

398
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:47,767
For saying those things to her
even though I don't know anything.

399
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,667
No, you don't.

400
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,167
You started just yesterday

401
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:55,000
and negated the sensitive nature
of our job.

402
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,733
We feel humiliated.

403
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,867
My sincere apologies.

404
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Although, you do have a point.

405
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,567
No one knows for sure what beauty is.

406
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,333
But, because no one knows,

407
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,667
someone like our boss, Mayumi Nanjo,

408
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:23,700
has to keep pursuing it.

409
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,667
Otherwise, our world would be

410
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:32,667
filled with ugly, cheap,
low quality stuff.

411
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:39,233
Well, for now,

412
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,367
that frown needs to go.

413
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,400
Yes.

414
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,667
The trunk show is coming.

415
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:54,100
Our sales this season will be determined
by a dozen or so attendees there.

416
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,567
So smile and do your best.

417
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,300
Okay.

418
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:14,200
No good.

419
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,167
THREE DAYS TILL TRUNK SHOW

420
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:54,267
-Good morning.
-Morning.

421
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,400
You're early.
How did it go yesterday?

422
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Good.

423
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm so sorry for causing trouble.

424
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:05,067
For a new hire, I was insolent.

425
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,567
Let me guess where you went after that.

426
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,600
Art museum.

427
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,000
Don't worry.
All of us have been there.

428
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,567
Why?
It's beautiful.

429
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,700
The problem is weight.

430
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,567
Yes, it is heavy.

431
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:48,900
But it should be okay if used in parts.

432
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:52,733
Or use a less dense type
to make it lighter.

433
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,700
No good.

434
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,833
It's gym clothes.

435
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,533
Gym clothes are evolving too.

436
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,667
You really are stubborn.

437
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,567
If you want beauty,

438
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:12,867
printed rayon bare jersey
will have bright and beautiful colors.

439
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:16,400
It has a different feel from silk
and drapes well.

440
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:20,067
Stretchable, hygroscopic,
and beautiful.

441
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,633
This is functional beauty.

442
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
"Functional beauty."

443
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,233
Yes.

444
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,100
Give it to me.

445
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,667
Yes.

446
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,767
I see.

447
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:39,167
Print is a good idea.

448
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:41,633
That's your response?

449
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,133
TWO DAYS TILL TRUNK SHOW

450
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,900
Here it is!

451
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,233
Pattern, fabric, colors.
All there!

452
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,133
I'll make a spec.

453
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
What's this?

454
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,000
Rayon bare jersey...

455
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:59,400
She wants to use this material?
And print?

456
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:04,700
Let's hurry up. We only have one more day!
Are you kidding?

457
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,433
DAY OF THE TRUNK SHOW

458
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,367
Here you go.

459
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,133
Please.

460
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,667
What do you think?

461
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:19,633
This is

462
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,800
an amazing world.

463
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,133
Thank goodness we made it.

464
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,033
Have I withered?

465
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,133
Still beautiful, Reiko.

466
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,833
The number is much lower this time.

467
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,133
The boss had a very hard time.

468
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,333
{\an8}This is a very famous brand.

469
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,033
I know this store!

470
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,067
This is a textile company.

471
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:16,133
And this...

472
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
What's wrong?

473
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,067
They rejected me when I was job hunting.

474
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,800
Classic, delicate, graceful.

475
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,300
That's Mayumi Nanjo's design.

476
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,500
But this time,

477
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:47,933
novel!

478
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,600
There it is. "Novel!"
She said "novel!"

479
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,033
Any complaints?

480
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,500
No way.

481
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,533
You make a new trend,
and the whole market moves.

482
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,200
I'll get more jobs.
Thank heavens.

483
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,400
See you later.
Good night.

484
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:13,400
<i>Why don't you say anything to her?</i>

485
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:18,133
Well, because I can't compete with her.

486
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,233
I doubt that.

487
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,467
I think you have better taste.

488
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
What?

489
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,233
This is what I don't like.

490
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,367
I love it because it's taking risks
on colors and design.

491
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:39,700
But...

492
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,533
I just don't like this.

493
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:45,633
It's like wearing a jersey.

494
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,100
Can you use silk here as usual?

495
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,533
-Excuse me, this material--
-Ms. Sato.

496
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,667
I'll use silk here.

497
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,633
Is the color okay as it is?

498
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,300
Wait, wait.
What is it?

499
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,200
I thought we put out
only what satisfies her.

500
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:09,267
-That's right.
-Then why did she agree to change it?

501
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,033
And Mizuki's design--

502
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,500
Customers are allowed to be irresponsible.

503
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:17,367
Even though we pride ourselves
for making the best and latest,

504
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:20,567
if we push our products to customers,
it's no longer made-to-order.

505
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,267
What the boss wants

506
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,200
is to make the one and only
for our customers.

507
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,667
That's what pleases them.

508
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:30,733
Look.

509
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,800
That's right.

510
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,333
It's fun, isn't it?

511
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:01,567
What are you doing?

512
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:06,467
See you tomorrow.

513
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Excuse me.

514
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
Well...

515
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,267
What do you really think?

516
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:23,467
Hmm?

517
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,767
What you think is beautiful
is different than what sells.

518
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,200
I agree.

519
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,800
But, do you really think
it's the right thing to do,

520
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,200
to make whatever customers want?

521
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,900
Does anyone show
what their true thoughts are?

522
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,300
It's a true thought because we hide it.

523
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,300
You really are a mismatch here

524
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:51,633
if you don't understand
the beauty of hiding.

525
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,767
That's not true.

526
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,267
A surprising response.

527
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,100
I don't know if I fit here,

528
00:41:57,033 --> 00:42:00,867
but I find underwear fascinating.

529
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,100
It's fascinating because it's enigmatic.

530
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:09,567
You're fascinating
because you're enigmatic.

531
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:11,667
I'm flattered.

532
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,400
Plus, I like this.

533
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:19,167
I think this is very good,
especially here.

534
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:24,167
When I saw this,
I thought this job was nice.

535
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:31,600
However, I can never buy
70,000 yen underwear.

536
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:34,200
People here have too much money.

537
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,733
What?

538
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,433
Are you saying you're tacky

539
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,133
because you're poor?

540
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,900
Don't underestimate the poor.

541
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,900
