1
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:25,100
WE ARE CLOSED FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH

2
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,633
<i>Don't stop.</i>

3
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,367
What exactly are your plans for Emotion?

4
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,967
-Hello.
-Welcome.

5
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,367
Please have a seat.

6
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,767
Thank you.

7
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,900
I'm sorry for coming by
during your time off.

8
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,567
No problem.

9
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,033
I have so much time on my hands.

10
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,867
I was happy when you called.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,567
You're here today
to discuss bridal lingerie?

12
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:44,633
Yes.

13
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,900
If you could take a look at this.

14
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:56,800
One of our customers had this bustier
made here, at Emotion.

15
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,733
Yes, Mayu had delivered it to you.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,900
Yes.

17
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:07,033
Another customer saw this picture

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,400
and said she'd like to have one
made for herself.

19
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,933
Really?

20
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,367
I'd be happy to make one for her.

21
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,167
-If she can come in sometime--
-Yes, but...

22
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,467
She can't.

23
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,300
Then I can go to her.

24
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:32,733
Actually, she's now overseas on business

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,767
and she won't make it back until
the day before the wedding.

26
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,500
And that's not all.
The wedding is in a week.

27
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,633
She's in London,

28
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,100
working as a consultant
for some famous think tank.

29
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,033
London?

30
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,200
My wife's been recruited
by a think tank in London.

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,400
Her name is Emi Mizuno.

32
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:05,100
{\an8}And the groom's name is Seiran Yoshioka.

33
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,567
MR. SEIRAN YOSHIOKA
MS. EMI MIZUNO

34
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:12,133
I have her measurements
from her dress fitting.

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
She's insisting.

36
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,000
Will you make it for her?

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,733
This customer's future husband...

38
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,300
Do you know...

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,733
who he is?

40
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:34,833
I met Mr. Yoshioka by coincidence
at Mr. Yamazaki's place.

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,633
So this order,

43
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,600
he placed it?

44
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,133
No, he didn't say anything.
And Emi...

45
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,533
The bride most likely

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,200
doesn't know about your relationship
with Mr. Yoshioka.

47
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,133
And yet, when she saw the picture,

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,367
she said she'd like to wear
this bustier for her wedding.

49
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,600
Don't you think this is a miracle?

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
What kind of face is that?

51
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,133
You met with him?
With Seiran?

52
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,133
He says he's getting married.

53
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,167
Married?

54
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,400
Oh, my.

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,033
Congratulations.

56
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,667
Of course,

57
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:35,233
he's at an age when you'd expect
this sort of thing to happen.

58
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
But I was so surprised.

59
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,867
He looked so good in his suit.

60
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,133
He's become an adult.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,667
Kids grow up, even if left alone.

62
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:55,900
That's not what I meant.

63
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,600
It's okay.

64
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,733
I really did leave him alone.

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
There you go again.

66
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:08,400
You worked hard, even as a mother.

67
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,900
But I'm glad.

68
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,433
If you got to see him,

69
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,667
then I'm glad.

70
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,567
Yes.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,500
So what are you going to do
about the bride's bustier?

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,367
I don't think I should get involved.

73
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,533
Why not?

74
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,733
I'm glad I got to see him.

75
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,633
But I don't want to step in any deeper.

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,433
How long do you plan on
holding on to negative memories?

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
What?

78
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,633
It's bad for Seiran too,

79
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,367
knowing he's got such a gloomy mom
somewhere out there.

80
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,500
He won't be able to sleep well!

81
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,500
It's not like I'm going to haunt him.

82
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:12,667
Holding on to regret is an obsession.

83
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,500
How many years do you think have passed?

84
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:18,667
Congratulate him openly and send him off.

85
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,900
This is something you can do for him
as his mother.

86
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,933
You've been given this opportunity.

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,967
Holding on to regret is an obsession.

88
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,633
You're right.

89
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:45,567
-It's time to let go, isn't it?
-That's right.

90
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,567
The story in your heart
shouldn't be buried there forever.

91
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,233
It's like holding on to clothes
you'll never wear,

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,967
and making your closet all moldy
as a result.

93
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,767
You're right.

94
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,200
MS. EMI MIZUNO (CONTACT INFO)

95
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm going to make it for her.

96
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,667
She's a customer, after all.

97
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,567
{\an8}SALES STRATEGY SEMINAR
DEVELOP NEW PLANS IN FIVE DAYS

98
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,067
This is your time off.

99
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,400
I guess you're more dedicated
than I thought.

100
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,533
Ditto.

101
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,700
What about your daughter?

102
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:06,933
She said that spending three days together
is enough.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,700
And your cat?

104
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,733
She's a fickle one.

105
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,000
She won't play with you?

106
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,900
It's better that way.

107
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,200
What do you think?
Is it helpful?

108
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,567
E-COMMERCE
USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET MORE CUSTOMERS

109
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,900
Maybe not.

110
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,900
Online shopping

111
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,067
doesn't exactly fit with
Emotion's custom-made concept.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,133
The same is true
with Em's in-person sales.

113
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,833
Although, it would be nice to expand
Em's outlet.

114
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,233
Especially since we're getting
more customers.

115
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,367
If we can consistently sell out
our product, we won't have excess stock.

116
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,833
So we need a shop...

117
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,467
Where we can just sell and sell.

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
We seem to be on the same page.

119
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,067
Only in matters of business.

120
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,500
It's almost time
for the afternoon session.

121
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:00,500
"Training Sales Staff to
Maximize Customer Satisfaction."

122
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,600
I think I'll pass.

123
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,133
I'm going. I paid the full fee.
I'm going to all of them!

124
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,233
Then I'll go to this simulation seminar.

125
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,233
That shouldn't make me too sleepy.

126
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:13,967
See you.

127
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,600
Thank you for joining us today.

128
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,600
Here in room B,

129
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:26,467
we will discuss training of sales staff
to maximize customer satisfaction.

130
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,567
"...MAXIMIZE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION"

131
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,433
That's so annoying.

132
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,800
Why do I have to add a thesis
to the senior year project?

133
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,067
Art needs no explanation.

134
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,167
I really don't feel motivated.

135
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,300
MAYU

136
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:00,733
No, I can't.

137
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,167
What can I create?

138
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,700
I've been thinking.

139
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,200
But looking at your face just now,
I saw it!

140
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,767
Maybe if I texted her...

141
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,433
One pair is something,

142
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,233
but three-of-a-kind?

143
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Yeah, I was so surprised.

144
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,167
I was approached and asked to lecture.

145
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:31,633
You're a top salesperson after all.

146
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,767
Not at all.

147
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,300
I thought you were in New York.

148
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,433
I was. I learned a lot from Mr. Miki.

149
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,767
So you came back and you're now lecturing
at a seminar. That's impressive.

150
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,200
And so are both of you.

151
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,533
We're all very diligent.

152
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,600
I've had enough.

153
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,167
Was the simulation seminar boring?

154
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:58,600
"And what if your business were to open
a shop in a commercial district?

155
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,900
Proposing a new kind of retail

156
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,100
that would revitalize
the commercial district."

157
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:09,200
The 300,000 yen prize for the simulation
competition is appealing, though.

158
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,667
-There's prize money?
-300,000 yen?

159
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,100
FIRST PLACE - 300,000 YEN
SECOND PLACE - 100,000 YEN

160
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,233
-You're interested?
-I spent a lot of money in New York!

161
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,133
So for this...

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,800
We get three days to write a proposal
and just have to present it?

163
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,633
It could be easy money.

164
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,600
Yeah, but...

165
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,300
-The judge...
-The judge? You know him?

166
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,433
-He's a former coworker.
-From the trading company?

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,100
We worked together in the fabric import
department for a long time.

168
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:40,833
Then that's good, if you know him well.

169
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Well, I haven't yet repaid
the money I borrowed,

170
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,467
so I don't really want to see him.

171
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:50,933
What? You should pay him back.

172
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,900
Ms. Nakatani,
will you pay him back for me?

173
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,367
I have the money with me.

174
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,567
Do it yourself!

175
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,400
He's lecturing too.

176
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,300
You know the organizers, right?

177
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,967
Here's an envelope.

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Please.

179
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:16,233
Well, I don't really mind.

180
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:24,733
Excuse me, this is...

181
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
the money Mr. Saruhashi borrowed from you.

182
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,100
What? And you are?

183
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm with Emotion.
I'm Ms. Nakatani.

184
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,267
RIN NAKATANI

185
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,467
From Emotion.

186
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,600
I still think it probably looks strange.

187
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,467
I'll go check...

188
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,033
There's no need for you to go.

189
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,767
-Why not?
-Because.

190
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:03,567
I see, you want to show off
your young and pretty coworker.

191
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,433
If that were the case,
I'd be encouraging you to go,

192
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,567
as the pretty boss.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,367
In any case, we wouldn't want there
to be some weird misunderstanding.

194
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,567
Hold on!

195
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,433
You saved me. Thanks!

196
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,733
I'm exhausted from a full day of seminars!

197
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Shall we go eat something?

198
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,333
That sounds good.

199
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm hungry.

200
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,200
Hey.

201
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,533
Let's take part...

202
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,433
in that simulation competition.

203
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,567
Let's show him, you know...

204
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,567
your former coworker.

205
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,167
We heard...

206
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,533
the reason why...

207
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:03,433
you had to borrow money from him.

208
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
For Emotion?

209
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,267
That was my fault, wasn't it?

210
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,633
It has nothing to do with you.

211
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,400
Emotion was in financial trouble

212
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,300
because of Story, right?

213
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,267
That's why you borrowed money, right?

214
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,500
It's something I did on my own.

215
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,733
And besides, it's not like
I'm holding a grudge against him.

216
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,667
He's a good guy.
He lent me money.

217
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,700
He didn't even say anything
after I didn't return it.

218
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,033
He's a good guy, right?

219
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,733
Yes, maybe "showing him"
wasn't the right way to put it.

220
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:56,800
But...

221
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,167
I want him to know...

222
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,533
that Emotion is back on its feet

223
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
and moving forward.

224
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,267
I want him to know that...

225
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,400
Emotion is a small shop

226
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,900
now trying to expand as a business.

227
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:21,133
And Jin Saruhashi is playing a key role
in bringing about this change.

228
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,033
I want to show him.

229
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:32,833
Are you okay with
never being able to face him again?

230
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,900
And this...

231
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,133
This could be good PR for us.

232
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:47,400
All the judges work as managers
for apparel trading companies.

233
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:51,400
Even if all we accomplish
is putting Emotion's name out there,

234
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:54,867
I think it's worth it.
It's worth a shot.

235
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,967
It would kill some time, I suppose.

236
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,533
It's only three days.

237
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,333
It'll be like a simulation game.

238
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,600
Shall we do it?

239
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,167
She replied!

240
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,700
Thanks for the message, Kaji!

241
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,000
No, no. Thank you.

242
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,267
I said I wanted to make something
only I could make, but it's hard.

243
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes! She's struggling!

244
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:03,000
This is my chance to be supportive.
I'll give it all I've got!

245
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,367
"Don't worry.

246
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:11,567
Just giving it shape
is already very important."

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,200
<i>You're right. Thanks! I'll try.</i>

248
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:22,733
She smiled! She smiled!

249
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:28,500
What, what?
You want to go somewhere later?

250
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:32,067
Good luck on writing your thesis!

251
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:35,533
Okay.

252
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,567
So this guy got married?

253
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:43,033
Yes, and relatively quickly too!

254
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,200
Well, I knew he had a girlfriend.

255
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,000
You can't control who you fall for.

256
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:53,200
But looking back now,
that was when I first came to Tokyo.

257
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,733
So maybe he just seemed cool to me.

258
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,200
This is delicious!

259
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,067
You're analyzing it very calmly.

260
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,300
After having worked for a while,
I finally realized

261
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,300
that it's usually
when I'm feeling insecure

262
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,233
that I fall for someone.

263
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,733
That's when I start thinking,
"He's so hot!"

264
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,033
Is that so?

265
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,833
If I can get that person to be
interested in me,

266
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,100
I could gain some confidence
for the time being.

267
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,333
But that's not quite how it works.

268
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,267
Well, no.

269
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,633
But I'm okay now.

270
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,867
I think I'm doing pretty well at work.

271
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:35,267
That's wonderful.

272
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,000
But be careful.

273
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:42,967
If you become too confident,
you won't be able to fall in love.

274
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,333
-Really?
-Is it me you're referring to?

275
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Oh, no.

276
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,867
You heard that?

277
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,967
I finished the base.
Will you take a look?

278
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,967
If she lives in London,

279
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:11,100
she might be more familiar
with leavers lace.

280
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,867
But I think going with a clean look

281
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,067
with just the motif on that side
could work too.

282
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,100
It's beautiful.

283
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,433
I think Emi would like this motif.

284
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,433
She's really beautiful. Very tall.

285
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
I see.

286
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,833
I'll send her pictures.

287
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,800
And let her decide.

288
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,167
I'll let you know as soon as she responds.

289
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,167
-Please do.
-Thank you.

290
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,833
Thank you for coming out here.

291
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,833
You have a wonderful job.

292
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Yes.

293
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,800
Your fetish for lace is quite something.

294
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:09,033
It's a reflection of your ambition
from your younger days.

295
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,433
It's a craving.

296
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,133
I had a thirst for beauty.

297
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,300
Money was tight at home.

298
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,233
Life was pretty tough back then.

299
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,767
And yet the young Mayumi

300
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,900
didn't go for food, didn't go for money.

301
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,633
She didn't go for rich men.

302
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,000
She went for beautiful lace.

303
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:35,600
-It's a real mystery.
-I had a young girl's pure heart.

304
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,600
My response to poverty
came through glittery, lacey things.

305
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,967
Like dresses for brides and princesses.

306
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,033
I adored them.

307
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,500
I was always drawing pictures,

308
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,067
drawings of princesses.

309
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,133
I drew those too.

310
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,100
It's the power they bring about
that makes all the difference.

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,433
Those feelings from back then

312
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,767
made me run this far.

313
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,300
Sometimes recklessly.

314
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,000
Thanks for running with me.

315
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,400
The other day,

316
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,800
I went up to the third floor
of the building

317
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,267
where we first opened the shop.

318
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:19,800
You did?

319
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,433
It looked exactly the same.

320
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,767
Brings back memories.

321
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
I wonder how everyone's doing.

322
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm sure they're doing well.

323
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,800
They've all turned into old hags,

324
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,700
and they're cheerfully cursing you.

325
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,700
I'm just kidding.
You already know that.

326
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,733
SIMULATION SEMINAR: PLANNING COMPETITION

327
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
INTRODUCTION OF EM PRODUCTS

328
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,567
Here are the copies.

329
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,633
They let you use everything here.

330
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,500
Thank you.

331
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,833
Color copies are free too?

332
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,233
That's thanks to the expensive fees
we had to pay.

333
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,800
Okay, shall we try it?

334
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,733
Will you try reading this, Mizuki?

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,267
"Women's lingerie may give the impression
of being expensive...

336
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,700
NEW RETAIL MODEL PROPOSED BY EM BY EMOTION

337
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,567
...but it's actually a common product
to be used daily.

338
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,767
ADDING SPICE TO ORDINARY DAYS

339
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:49,067
We want consumers
to be able to buy it more easily.

340
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,500
For example, when you buy

341
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,900
some bread at a local bakery..."

342
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:59,800
I really think it would be better
if you did this, Ms. Nakatani.

343
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,467
It sounds better coming from you.

344
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:04,133
-But...
-If you say it,

345
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,733
even these pictures look like
they're of some high-end bakery in Paris.

346
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,733
When you say it,
it just looks like a local bakery.

347
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,133
When you say it, it pisses me off.

348
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,300
In any case, here.

349
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,800
Okay.

350
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,400
I'll just read it for now.

351
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,933
ADDING THE SPICE OF LINGERIE
TO YOUR ORDINARY DAY.

352
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,267
For example, when you buy some bread
at a local bakery,

353
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,600
if you step a little deeper
into the store,

354
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:37,267
it opens up to
a comfortable private space.

355
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,067
At first, it almost looks like a café,
but upon closer look,

356
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:43,567
there are chests, sofas,

357
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,633
dressers and similar furniture.

358
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:51,300
If you think about it objectively,

359
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:55,067
it's kind of strange
to have lingerie in a bakery.

360
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,567
Of course.

361
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,200
But it wouldn't have any impact
if the idea wasn't interesting.

362
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:02,367
It's not as if it's a real shop.

363
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:05,600
I think it's a real possibility.

364
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,933
If we collaborate with an existing shop,

365
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,433
it goes with the concept
of revitalizing the commercial district.

366
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,900
Perhaps we should make
Ms. Nakatani our leader.

367
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:20,200
-Yes! That sounds great.
-What?

368
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,767
Why did you leave
the trading company anyway?

369
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,033
It was a major company,
you were set for life.

370
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,567
It's true, but...

371
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:37,900
Just as I was starting my job,
we experienced deflation.

372
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,733
So there was a global trend

373
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,267
of favoring quantity
and cheap prices over quality.

374
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:48,367
Yes, luxury brands took a hit.

375
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:55,133
We therefore had to import cheap fabrics
made under terrible labor conditions.

376
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,133
I saw a little too much ugliness.

377
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,100
I have a sensitive soul.

378
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,300
When you say it like that,

379
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,633
I become deaf
to any good parts of your story.

380
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,533
But President Nanjo...

381
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,767
Emotion's President Nanjo

382
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,133
would order ridiculously expensive fabrics

383
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,967
one after another.

384
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,800
Fabric made in Italy and France.

385
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,100
In small quantity.

386
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
But she never made the compromise
of switching to cheaper fabrics.

387
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,167
I can see that.

388
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:32,400
That's when I thought, "This is for me."

389
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,300
It's things like that...

390
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:42,267
That's what I really love about Emotion.

391
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,333
The pride.

392
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,500
You were a fan of Emotion, right?

393
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:49,700
Yes.

394
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,267
I've wanted to be on the creator's side.

395
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:57,100
Although lately, I've been thinking
that sales isn't too bad either.

396
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,100
What? Don't quit!

397
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,433
I won't quit.

398
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,233
After coming to Emotion,

399
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,267
I've rediscovered the meaning of selling
while seeing the customer's face.

400
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,400
That's why I want Em to sell more.

401
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:14,533
Maybe even open a new shop.

402
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,967
I'm sorry, I'm letting my imagination
get the better of me.

403
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,133
We're...

404
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,033
on the same page.

405
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,800
It's like we're having a conversation.

406
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:46,067
It's done. I'm finished!

407
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes!

408
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,167
"I'm glad."

409
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:57,200
Thanks, but...

410
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,067
What's wrong?

411
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:04,233
<i>I'm conflicted</i>
<i>about showing this to the boss.</i>

412
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,700
<i>I don't think the boss will like it.</i>

413
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:56,400
You really love that color,
don't you, boss?

414
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,433
{\an8}PLANNING COMPETITION
PRESENTATION

415
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,167
{\an8}From this, we propose the shopping
district and city planning game

416
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,500
be combined into a new town.

417
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,200
That's the end of the Revise presentation.

418
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,800
Next up is lingerie company Emotion.

419
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:56,033
We'd like to begin with
a description of Emotion,

420
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,467
and of the products
we will be selling in this proposal,

421
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,567
from Em by Emotion.

422
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:07,000
I was so nervous.

423
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:10,267
Who could've predicted that 30 companies
would enter the competition?

424
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,300
You turn white so easily, Mizuki.

425
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,433
I'm glad we made Ms. Nakatani our leader.

426
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,933
I hate public speaking.

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,167
I've never done anything like this.
It was fun.

428
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:23,733
We didn't get the 300,000 yen, though.

429
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,067
Let's see, who won?

430
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,267
I think it was Shoyo Corp.

431
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,967
They wanted to set up
their duty-free counter in the district.

432
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:34,867
That one! I thought that was good too.

433
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,167
And us?

434
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,867
Honorable Mention! 20,000 yen!

435
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
20,000 yen for three whole days of work.

436
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,300
Just 20,000 yen!

437
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,500
It's like sweatshop wages.

438
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:48,200
We worked pretty hard on it.

439
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,633
We are very diligent.

440
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,100
But your former coworker

441
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:59,600
gave us a score of four out of five.

442
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,700
JUDGE'S NAME - SCORE

443
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,867
The others gave out
a score of three at most.

444
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,967
A congratulatory gift?

445
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,967
To a revived Emotion?

446
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,633
Maybe,

447
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,033
but I'm sure he no longer thinks...

448
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:21,133
that you're just some
women's lingerie shop employee.

449
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:28,067
Now you can go out for drinks with him!

450
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,400
Yes. He's a good guy after all.

451
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,233
Yeah, it was really fun.

452
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:45,500
I know!

453
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,733
The three of us should go out for drinks.

454
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,333
We've got 20,000 yen.

455
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,033
We can go to a pretty nice place!

456
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,533
That's true, we might as well drink!

457
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,167
But...

458
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
this proposal,

459
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,433
can't we use it in real life?

460
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,633
Why don't we propose it
to President Nanjo?

461
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,567
For Em's new shop.

462
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,600
It's beautiful!

463
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,067
I'm glad I finished it in time.

464
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,633
I'm sure Emi will love it.

465
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,433
-It's "something blue".
-Yes.

466
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,400
A happiness charm.

467
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,033
I was going to add a blue garter belt,

468
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,967
but maybe that's not
what the bride would want.

469
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,333
It's cute, and wonderful.

470
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,433
And it's indigo, like Mr. Yoshioka.

471
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,467
-I'm sorry.
-No.

472
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,067
But this...

473
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,300
This is simply "something blue".

474
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,067
I'll let them know.

475
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,167
Well...

476
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:12,900
Thank you for delivering it in person.

477
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:13,967
No.

478
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,700
Well...

479
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:19,800
I came here because...

480
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:22,833
Well...

481
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,700
Well, excuse me.

482
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,600
Please wait!

483
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,600
The bouquet will look something like this.

484
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,267
The ceremony...

485
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,900
-is in two days?
-Yes.

486
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,800
<i>I'm going to start my own family.</i>

487
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,633
<i>So please don't worry.</i>

488
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,700
I've never been alone.

489
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,033
<i>I'm glad I got to see you.</i>

490
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,933
I wish I could've seen it, too.

491
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:50,933
It was pretty.

492
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,967
It was beautiful.

493
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,367
I'm sure it was.

494
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,833
The summer break is over.

495
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,467
It was a nice break.

496
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:06,767
Yes, it was.

497
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,667
I experienced something new.

498
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,600
Really? What?

499
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,433
For the first time,

500
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,833
I made something for myself.

501
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,367
That bustier...

502
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,533
as soon as I put the first stitch in,

503
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,067
that thing you said,

504
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,300
my obsession of holding on to regret...

505
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,400
seemed to vanish from here.

506
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,500
After that,

507
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,100
<i>it wasn't for my son,</i>

508
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,200
<i>nor my son's future wife,</i>

509
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,233
<i>but for me.</i>

510
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,633
I know,

511
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,533
it wasn't the right thing to do.

512
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:02,100
But the process of making it saved me.

513
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,200
Now I can move forward.

514
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,133
Don't hold back,
although I know you love the boss.

515
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,567
This has nothing to do with love.

516
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,500
<i>Being rejected by someone you respect</i>
<i>is scary.</i>

517
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
But...

518
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:47,333
But respecting someone
and doing as you're told

519
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,733
are two different things.

520
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,467
<i>Thanks. I feel braver.</i>

521
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,433
I gained weight. I gained weight.

522
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,533
-Didn't I gain weight?
-Did you?

523
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,500
You're glowing, as if you got younger!

524
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,200
Really?

525
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,500
I think you lost weight.

526
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:38,967
-Did I?
-Tough time with your thesis?

527
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,867
I'm not done yet.

528
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,633
That's no good!
What have you been doing?

529
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,867
Well, I had a lot on my mind.

530
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,333
What? What's going on?

531
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,367
I... I'll go clean the windows!

532
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,700
-I took down the notice.
-Thank you.

533
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:12,100
What? What's that?

534
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,733
Nothing.

535
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,967
Good morning.

536
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,200
It's chilly today.

537
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,633
Good morning!

538
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,833
I'm glad everyone's looking well.

539
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,233
Did you enjoy your break?

540
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,467
Yes, it was a lot of fun.

541
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:31,867
-I learned a lot.
-I'm glad.

542
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:35,133
-Well--
-I know this is sudden,

543
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,500
but I have something to say.

544
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,333
Don't worry, It's nothing serious.

545
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,367
It's about the upcoming trunk show
in March.

546
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,833
Last year,
we put on a big show.

547
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,733
And both Em and Emotion

548
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,433
were able to make great progress.

549
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,800
As a result, we are selling well.

550
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,667
With the addition of Ms. Nakatani,

551
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:03,800
our business operations
have become smoother.

552
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,000
Thank you.

553
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,667
Emotion has stepped up.

554
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:12,267
What I'd wished for 30 years ago,

555
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,167
and wasn't able to accomplish,

556
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:17,433
has finally come to be.

557
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,500
This remarkable growth

558
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,700
didn't happen thanks to me alone,

559
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,733
but thanks to everyone here.

560
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,267
Thank you.

561
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,200
What is this? It's very weird.

562
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,833
Yes, what's with you all of a sudden?

563
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,367
Well, I just had the opportunity
to look back at my own work.

564
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,633
It made me think...

565
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,100
about everything that's happened.

566
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:50,833
Well, yes.

567
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,167
It made me realize I need to be thankful,

568
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,567
and also,

569
00:38:57,633 --> 00:39:01,000
that I'd like to get back to my roots.

570
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,400
I want to go back to my roots...

571
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:07,533
because we've grown.

572
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,833
Going back to your roots sounds good.

573
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Returning to one's origins?

574
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,933
I think that's important.

575
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,333
If we try to grow more radically,

576
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,267
or challenge ourselves with something new,
it may be too forced.

577
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:26,433
I want to protect Emotion
and keep it as it is now.

578
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,200
So in March,
we'll have the trunk show here as always.

579
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,167
What about the theme?
Have you chosen one?

580
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,867
Yes.

581
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:40,033
The theme for this fall/winter season
will be "Elegance".

582
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:44,033
"Elegance" is Emotion's roots.

583
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,400
Grace,

584
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,000
refinement,

585
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:51,300
silk and lace...

586
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,433
Oh...

587
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,367
The sensitive beauty of stitching.

588
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:58,700
That is Emotion's soul.

589
00:39:58,767 --> 00:39:59,967
Well!

590
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:02,900
What's wrong?

591
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,333
I'd like to propose something.

592
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:14,067
Why so suddenly?

593
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:17,133
-We're talking about our new outlook--
-Boss.

594
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,733
There's something I'd like to show you.

595
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:59,067
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
