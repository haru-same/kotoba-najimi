1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,233
You're here.

2
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,900
You're early.

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,800
What do you mean, I'm early?

4
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,067
Why don't you pick up your phone?

5
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:47,100
I keep telling you
not to call me at night.

6
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,033
I'm at an age now
where I keep having to get up at night.

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you mean?
I was worried!

8
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54,800
Worried?

9
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,367
Because you said you were going to retire.

10
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,067
You thought I was being serious?

11
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:05,033
-What?
-I was just feeling a little tired.

12
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,900
But after a good night's sleep,
I feel rejuvenated.

13
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,700
How come you look so refreshed?

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Yes.

15
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,000
I had an idea.

16
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,700
Every day, <i>Conscious</i> is getting
increasingly more calls

17
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,600
from customers
who want to buy this product.

18
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,700
We need to respond in some way.

19
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,333
If we want to fulfill
our customers' needs,

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,300
we should market this product right away.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,900
Or we can just say this was a sample
and not a product for sale.

22
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,100
What do you think, Ms. Tokita?

23
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:08,733
I don't think we should market this.

24
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,033
You don't want to sell it?

25
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,267
This isn't an Emotion product.

26
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,633
We can't sell something

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,267
the boss doesn't approve of
as an Emotion product.

28
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,933
That's true.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,100
It's cute,

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,100
but perhaps too different in style
from what we make.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,233
It might confuse our customers.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,033
So I guess we should respectfully decline.

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,200
Why?

34
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,367
If people are saying they want it,

35
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,033
why should we turn them down?

36
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,600
But...

37
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,700
You said this wasn't lingerie.

38
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:57,300
What I think is beautiful...

39
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,933
and what the customers want
are two different things.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,867
I've often experienced
this kind of situation in the past.

41
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,733
And when that happened,

42
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,333
what did I do?

43
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:16,433
You've always responded 100%
in accordance with your customers' needs.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,667
That's right.

45
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,067
But this is...

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
completely different
from the type of lingerie Emotion offers.

47
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,500
Even so,

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,533
if the customers say
this is what they want,

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
then we will make it for them.

50
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,167
That's our job, isn't it?

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,867
The extra income could come in handy.

52
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,600
Extra income?

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,567
That's...

54
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,300
{\an8}It's true,

55
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,267
{\an8}Em is too confined as it is now.

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,300
{\an8}We don't have enough space
for customers to browse at their leisure.

57
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,633
{\an8}Yes.

58
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,933
{\an8}You have a good location, right?

59
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,867
Does that mean...

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,033
If this sells,

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,633
we should have enough funds
to open the new shop.

62
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,933
This is an opportunity.

63
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:26,800
Emotion will make this product
to fulfill our customers' needs.

64
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:32,733
And we'll use the profits to fund
the opening of the new Em shop.

65
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,833
Really?

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,167
If we're going to do this,

67
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,167
let's aim to open in March.

68
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,433
Wait!

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,833
Wait, wait.

70
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,300
What about the trunk show?

71
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,100
Of course, we'll do that too.

72
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:52,167
We'll make that, open a new shop,
and put on a trunk show?

73
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,133
All that in March?

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
I don't actually mind

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,967
being very busy.

76
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,300
Kaji. Let's get him over here now.

77
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:24,300
The cups don't require a changeover.

78
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,567
They will be processed at the factory,

79
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,733
so as long as it's in the specs...

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,500
Then why do I have to create patterns?

81
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,633
I want to clearly convey

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,000
the purpose of making this product
to the production line.

83
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,033
I don't have any patterning skills,

84
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,633
so please, boss...

85
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,900
For mass production,
this is important, right?

86
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:46,967
That's right.

87
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,567
The specs document is a love letter
to the craftspeople.

88
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,233
Then, please...

89
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,600
Our boss isn't someone

90
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:59,467
who wouldn't do her best
just because she doesn't like the product.

91
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,000
I can't believe that...

92
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,400
I have to create something
while following your instructions.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
That's so annoying!

94
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,167
No!

95
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,233
I can't sew to these specs!

96
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,167
How many stitches
do the side nets require?

97
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,567
It's not clear at all!

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,000
Even when comparing the same two inches,

99
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,267
sewing ten stitches versus 14 stitches

100
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,000
gives completely different results!

101
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,067
These details make all the difference!

102
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm sorry!

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
She's totally back to her old self.

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,300
You seem very motivated, boss.

105
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:51,400
Working with these,
I realize they aren't too bad.

106
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,400
For older customers
who desire a comfortable fit,

107
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:55,933
this may work.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,100
So you approve of my work?

109
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,900
I didn't say that. If it were me,
I'd make something more beautiful.

110
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,233
That could be interesting,

111
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
if you made products geared for seniors.

112
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:16,000
Then, why not have size-15 mannequins?

113
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,633
Right.

114
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,900
We can take it even further.

115
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,933
Rather than having such a polished design,

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,367
something with a lot of flowers
would be more appealing to seniors.

117
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:31,033
Flowers. I was wondering...

118
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,133
Why do older women like flowers so much?

119
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,467
It doesn't always start off that way.

120
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,533
It's when they realize
they're going to die soon

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,633
that people start to love flowers.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,367
Someday, you're going to love flowers too.

123
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,400
Remember this when your time comes.

124
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,900
We don't have time for this!

125
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,667
I have to finish the specs by end of day!

126
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:06,500
In any case, I'm going to sew.

127
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,833
Ouch!

128
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,567
Did you stitch your finger?

129
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,833
Of course not, I'm not an amateur.

130
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:20,000
Fourteen stitches for every inch.
Make sure you get that down.

131
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,000
The specs document--

132
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,033
Is a love letter to the craftspeople.

133
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,100
What?

134
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,367
Nothing.

135
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:44,067
Reiko! What's with her?

136
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:48,233
After having rejected the whole idea,
she's now totally serious about it.

137
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,467
Once she decides to make something,
she tries to make it the best it can be.

138
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,800
That's President Nanjo for you.

139
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,133
I'm sure customers will be really happy

140
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,367
to find the product being much better than
what they see in the magazine.

141
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,367
Hey, why are you slacking off over there?

142
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,900
We're not done yet!

143
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,733
The boss is a devil.

144
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
It's as if she's in a hurry
to nurture her successor.

145
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
What?

146
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,967
Reiko, there's something going on
with her, right?

147
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,400
Here I am, the reliable helper!

148
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,700
So, what should I do?

149
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,833
This is the product's final design.

150
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:40,767
The materials, the grading,
the color variations,

151
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,333
everything is in the specs.

152
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,867
It looks really good.

153
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,533
I want to sell it at the new shop too.

154
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,300
But first--

155
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,733
So maybe we can order 2,000 units.

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,133
The materials?

157
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,133
Yes, we've ordered plenty.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,633
Then let's get it made
as soon as possible.

159
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,133
But first...

160
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,367
there's something I'd like to ask you.

161
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
What is it?

162
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,667
What name should we put on the tag?

163
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,867
This isn't custom-made.

164
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,233
So it wouldn't be right
to put Emotion's tag on it.

165
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,633
Since Mayu made it,

166
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,333
Em doesn't seem quite right for it either.

167
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:24,067
What should we call it then?

168
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,233
Mayu?

169
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,267
My name?

170
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,933
Alas, it's also my name.

171
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,067
Mayu. I like it.

172
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,800
And it fits the feel of the material.

173
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,333
It's perfect for evoking
an image of nature.

174
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,400
I'd like for the upcoming trunk show

175
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:58,367
to display our new outlook.

176
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,967
New outlook?

177
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,600
Emotion, Em and Mayu.

178
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:07,300
We'll display all three of them
to many customers.

179
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,500
And of course, we'll announce
the opening of our new shop.

180
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,667
This show will be very different
from the previous ones.

181
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,233
We'll not only open up the shop,

182
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,167
but the office area as well,

183
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,900
and we'll reveal everything.

184
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:28,433
What we've made so far
and what we'll be making in the future.

185
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,700
Like a showroom?

186
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,267
More like an exhibition.

187
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,700
I want people to see
the past and present of Emotion.

188
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:45,033
And we'll announce the future of Emotion,
Em and Mayu.

189
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:49,900
We'll invite people
from all walks of life,

190
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:53,367
talk with them,
and be inspired by them.

191
00:11:54,367 --> 00:12:00,133
We'll use this opportunity
to allow Emotion to become more open.

192
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,800
But...

193
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,433
is it really okay to have Mayu in there?

194
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,167
Are you admitting that this is beautiful?

195
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,800
Does this ribbon confirm that?

196
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,767
What you said,
about this not being lingerie,

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,400
are you taking it back?

198
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,667
It can't be helped.

199
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:36,467
When a dependent becomes the provider,

200
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,233
no one can kick her out, right?

201
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,133
-Impossible.
-Please.

202
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,400
I think the boss would speak freely
with you, Mr. Yamazaki.

203
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:56,300
We're just old acquaintances.

204
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm curious too.

205
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,033
What does Ms. Nanjo have in mind now?

206
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,500
I won't be able to get it out of her.

207
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,967
Please!

208
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:12,100
I want to know how the boss really feels.

209
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,733
Your fingers. I see...

210
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,133
That's a little tough.

211
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,167
It's not so bad, really.

212
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,400
My fingers were merely the spark.

213
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,767
But they did remind me of my age.

214
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,067
I've seen many people in this business.

215
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:43,967
It must be difficult
to make decisions all on your own.

216
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,733
I can't make them on my own.

217
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
My whole life is there.

218
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:58,400
But external factors begin to pile up,

219
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,667
and before you know it,

220
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:06,233
you find yourself forced into realizing
that this is the only path for you.

221
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,233
And then finally,

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,833
that's when you're able
to make a decision.

223
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,200
The place looks spacious when it's empty.

224
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,667
The office too.

225
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,867
Yeah.

226
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,167
Should we count the mannequins?

227
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,667
Sure.

228
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,933
If you need more, we can borrow them.

229
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Thanks.

230
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,700
We'll have Emotion products at the front.

231
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,033
We'll need to have enough.

232
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,667
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

233
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,233
Kaji.

234
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes?

235
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,533
I love this shop.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,767
Yes.

237
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
Wanting the person you admire...

238
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,933
to remain the same forever...

239
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,333
is that childish of me?

240
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,167
Kaji,

241
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,733
I need to ask you a favor.

242
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,400
CLOSED TEMPORARILY

243
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,200
Like this, here.

244
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,267
Mizuki, for this mannequin
in front, I think...

245
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,433
this one is good.
What do you think?

246
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:20,100
Yeah, I think so too.
Let's go with that.

247
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,333
Hey, what about Mayu's?

248
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
What's wrong?

249
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,533
She's...

250
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm sorry. The shipment from
Hashiguchi Tailors is running late.

251
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,133
But I think it'll get here soon.

252
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,033
Yeah?
Let's get it done by tonight.

253
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,333
Feeling quite emotional?

254
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,467
Yes.

255
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,167
I made some of these a long time ago.

256
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,767
This kind of display

257
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,167
makes it look like
a Mayumi Nanjo retrospective.

258
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,300
Seriously,

259
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:01,667
President Nanjo's work
was truly wonderful.

260
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,967
Stop talking as if I'm already dead.

261
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:09,833
I emphasized "work."

262
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,867
Did you not notice?

263
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, I understand I have issues
with things other than work.

264
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,100
This was a great idea.

265
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,367
Getting to see everything you've made,

266
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,267
even we've never had that opportunity.

267
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,533
Yes, it's really wonderful!

268
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,433
If we tour departments around the country,
I'm sure we can attract many customers.

269
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,600
-Yeah, that would be great.
-It feels good.

270
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,967
Shall we open a bottle?

271
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,167
-Thank you!
-Here you are.

272
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,967
Are you really...

273
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,300
going to say it?

274
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,633
I've made my decision.

275
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,700
Cheers!

276
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,133
Aren't you drinking too much?

277
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,867
I'm glad you're yourself again.

278
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,033
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,800
Reiko.

280
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,333
May I have your attention?

281
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:02,400
I feel so good right now,
I've decided to say this now.

282
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:05,867
Boss?

283
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,733
This exhibition...

284
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,733
is actually...

285
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:16,133
a retrospective of Mayumi Nanjo's work.

286
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,867
But until I saw it

287
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:23,633
actually taking shape,

288
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,767
I didn't know
how I would really feel.

289
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,900
Looking at it now,

290
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,467
I know.

291
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,633
I...

292
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:42,967
Mayumi Nanjo,

293
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:47,267
-once this exhibition is over--
-Excuse me.

294
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
First,

295
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,600
may I say something?

296
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,733
You...

297
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,867
I'm trying to say something
very important right now.

298
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,600
Why is your timing so terrible?

299
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,233
What I have to say,

300
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,467
I believe, is more urgent.

301
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,767
Urgent?

302
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,667
Yes.

303
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,033
What is it?

304
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,767
Mayu products...

305
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,467
can't be displayed at this exhibition.

306
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,233
Mayu is not an Emotion product.

307
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,700
It's what I made.

308
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,767
My taste and policy
are completely different from yours.

309
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,067
To put that out here,

310
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,700
next to Emotion and Em,

311
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,733
I can't allow it.

312
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,900
What do you mean?

313
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:53,233
I'm saying Mayu is mine.

314
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,767
I made it on my own.

315
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,200
But it's somehow been absorbed by Emotion.

316
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,833
I can't agree to that.

317
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,133
I'm sure its profits
will be greater than yours.

318
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:14,967
Wait...

319
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,733
You said so yourself, boss.

320
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,333
As a creator,

321
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,300
if this is what I want to make,

322
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,933
then Emotion is not for me.

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,533
But now that you expect it to sell,
you change your mind?

324
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,000
That's enough!

325
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,467
I'm...

326
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,267
going independent.

327
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,233
Emotion is...

328
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,700
no longer the place for me.

329
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,633
How can you say that, Mayu?

330
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,100
The boss was planning on
helping you grow--

331
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,900
I'm sorry!
I don't need any help.

332
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,067
Mayumi Nanjo and I...

333
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,967
have very different goals.

334
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,600
I'll make what I want on my own.

335
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
So boss, please continue...

336
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,300
to make products...

337
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,267
that fit Emotion's style.

338
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,600
Now...

339
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,400
that space will be empty.

340
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,433
I'm sorry, boss,

341
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,367
but can you make something new right now?

342
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:54,267
The theme for the trunk show in March
was supposed to be "Elegance," right?

343
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:57,367
But...

344
00:22:58,267 --> 00:22:59,700
you haven't made anything yet.

345
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,700
A retrospective?

346
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,367
You're admiring your past work,

347
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,767
but you're not capable of
making anything new?

348
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,167
That means...

349
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,133
you're finished as a creator.

350
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,467
So,

351
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,800
I know this is sudden,

352
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,167
but thank you for everything.

353
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,367
Excuse me.

354
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,533
Wait!

355
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,333
What is this?

356
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,333
Say how you really feel!

357
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:13,233
Do you think there's anyone
who goes around saying,

358
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,267
"This is how I really feel"?

359
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,800
I've learned how to hide things.

360
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,500
I'm also...

361
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,133
a lingerie maker.

362
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:51,900
Hey!

363
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,133
What's going on?

364
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:54,633
No,

365
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:56,533
I...

366
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,800
{\an8}ROSE - "LOVE"
AZALEA - "TEMPERANCE" - "FRAGILITY"

367
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:44,800
<i>Then, why not have size-15 mannequins?</i>

00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:05,100
{\an8}CHARACTERISTICS OF STRETCH SATIN

369
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,100
<i>"In the past few years,</i>

370
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:24,100
{\an8}<i>the demand for underwear</i>
<i>that helps seniors stay active</i>

371
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,367
{\an8}<i>has been increasing.</i>

372
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:30,533

<i>none of it can be called</i>

375
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,400
<i>Please create comfortable lingerie</i>

376
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:44,833
<i>to satisfy older women</i>
<i>who love flowers."</i>

377
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:54,533
The specs document
is a love letter to the craftspeople.

378
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,067
<i>"The theme is...</i>

379
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,500
<i>'Comfortable Elegance.'"</i>

380
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:08,767
From Mayuko Tokita

381
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:22,500
All right, then.

382
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,667
You want me to make it, right?

383
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,933
"Elegance."

384
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,400
That's right.

385
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,300
Every woman...

386
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,133
will age...

387
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,967
and will always...

388
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,533
go back to seeking elegance.

389
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,933
Because...

390
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:05,100
lace...

391
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
and embroidery...

392
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:15,133
will never become obsolete.

393
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,333
Because...

394
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:24,367
every woman,
before she dies,

395
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,100
will come to love flowers.

396
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,267
She was planning on quitting.

397
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,933
She lit her fire once again.

398
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,533
Thank you.

399
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,500
-Welcome.
-Hello!

400
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:04,133
This is from the show.

401
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,567
I was looking for something like this!

402
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,433
I bow to you, Mayumi Nanjo.

403
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,167
From now on,

404
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:24,833
I'm going to make more products
for mature women like us.

405
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,500
I'm so glad you're here!

406
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,867
How creepy.

407
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,067
I hope you're not dying tomorrow.

408
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,633
As long as people like you
persistently go on working,

409
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,900
I feel like I can do it too!

410
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm certain the women who'll wear this
will feel the same way.

411
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,333
This has no wire in it.

412
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,233
Really?

413
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:55,833
Hello.

414
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,033
Congratulations on further progress.

415
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:08,433
I hear Vanderbilt's will be starting
a new private label.

416
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,833
Yes, in casual wear.

417
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,233
I'm sure it won't happen again,
but please don't steal from us.

418
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,800
Don't put it like that.

419
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm only looking at it
so as to have a reference.

420
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,933
I hear you're opening a shop in Harajuku.

421
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,633
-Yes.
-I'm certain you'll succeed.

422
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,567
I did recruit you, after all.

423
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,233
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you
at the time.

424
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,500
How is Fumi doing?

425
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,267
She's quite ambitious.

426
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:55,133
A new idea from Story.

427
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,833
Socks?

428
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,600
Apparently, socks are the next big thing.

429
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:02,633
If you'll excuse me.

430
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,433
We can't lose.

431
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
DESIGNER FUMIKA IDA

432
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:13,633
You're right.

433
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,967
Mr. Miki is here.

434
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,333
-Hello.
-Mr. Miki.

435
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,967
It's beautiful.
It's like an art museum.

436
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,867
Ms. Nanjo's over there.

437
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,700
Then I'll go say hello later.

438
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,567
Thanks for your help at the show, Yuri.

439
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,233
Not at all. It was fun!

440
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,200
But...

441
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,533
it's sad...

442
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,700
that Mayu isn't here today.

443
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:50,633
Is she really...

444
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:53,900
gone for good?

445
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,567
Excuse me.

446
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,367
Is this Mayuko Tokita's shop?

447
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,800
Yes.

448
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,933
Let's bring it in.
Careful!

449
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,733
I need to buy a sewing machine.

450
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,100
A sewing machine, for sure.

451
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,633
But I have no money.

452
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,100
What should I do?

453
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,000
Thank you!

454
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,133
Thank you.

455
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,200
What's this?

456
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,200
Please sign here.

457
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,233
Kaji?

458
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,833
I told them.

460
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:14,967
You go over there, got it?

461
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,067
Let her know, all right?

462
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,033
{\an8}This is a handyman I know.
I've asked him for new sewing machines.

463
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,400
{\an8}HANDYMAN TAMINATO
CALL US FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED!

464
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,467
This is from the boss.

465
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,133
I can't accept this.

466
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,500
I have to return it.

467
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,233
Why not just keep it?

468
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,467
But I said those things--

469
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,733
Why can't you accept their kindness?

470
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,367
I'm sorry for yelling.

471
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,433
But...

472
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,367
This is from the boss's heart.

473
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,567
To send it back...

474
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,267
That wouldn't be right.

475
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:35,800
And also,

476
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,000
about me...

477
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:43,067
I'm going back to Takasaki this weekend.

478
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,567
So, will you...

479
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,133
turn me down officially?

480
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,467
It was all thanks to you.

481
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,800
Thanks to you,

482
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:15,000
I now understand how women feel
when they pick out their lingerie.

483
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,367
Or rather,
it would be more accurate to say that

484
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,067
I've begun to understand.

485
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:27,967
I think that when making something,

486
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:31,167
what you feel is important.

487
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,967
I know that now.

488
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,233
I wish I could--

489
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,533
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,267
This will be the last time.

491
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,933
Think of it as a goodbye gift to me.

492
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Also,

493
00:35:58,233 --> 00:35:59,700
everyone is waiting for you.

494
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,133
The boss is waiting.

495
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,333
In the end, you'll regret it
if you don't face them.

496
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,767
After this,

497
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,067
I'll have no regrets.

498
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:23,000
We don't develop new fabrics.

499
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:26,700
I think you have the wrong idea
about our job.

500
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,367
I'm sure you'll go through a lot,
but we'll do this together, okay?

501
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:10,967
If we can get through this,
Emotion will make it.

502
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,767
It's been awhile since I've had...

503
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:40,533
You give me discomfort.
You know why?

504
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,500
Because you're not beautiful.

505
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,967
Everything you want to know is there.

506
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:51,133
<i>You understand now?</i>
<i>That's why you wear lingerie.</i>

507
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,167
Beauty is a weapon.

508
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,033
<i>Someone seems to have matured.</i>

509
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,033
How annoying.

510
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:46,733
Amazing.

511
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,367
I made them as per your instructions.

512
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,433
So you'll have to inspect them all.

513
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,633
Yes.

514
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,467
Well, even if you hadn't said anything,

515
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,200
I would have made them.

516
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:05,767
That's a lie.

517
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:09,333
You were planning on retiring.

518
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:13,633
That's why you accepted what I made.

519
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:18,367
You gave in despite not approving at all.

520
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:24,233
By saying Emotion should be more open,

521
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,733
you tried to wrap it all up.

522
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:33,567
Selling in this shop
a product you don't approve of...

523
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,933
is not something Mayumi Nanjo would do.

524
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:45,333
I won't let you quit, ever.

525
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,867
Whether your fingers hurt,
or if you fall into a slump,

526
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:56,333
or become outdated, or lose confidence,

527
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,100
it doesn't matter.

528
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:03,867
If someone like you disappears
from the creative front,

529
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,767
then who will teach everyone
how beautiful things are made,

530
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,300
or how to do beautiful work?

531
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:18,200
No, you don't even have to teach.

532
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,333
You just have to be there!

533
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:25,467
Right there.

534
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,567
You must be kidding me.

535
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,167
I just have to be here?
I'm not a fool.

536
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:44,433
I don't plan on retiring.

537
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,433
I can still create.

538
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,467
Besides, I'll let you in on something.

539
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,967
I...

540
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:03,100
love this job even more than I used to.

541
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,400
There's freedom because
it's something you don't show others.

542
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,500
But you're also free to show others.

543
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:16,333
Just as our tastes completely differ,

544
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,900
you're free to decide
what you consider beautiful.

545
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:25,300
I realize now,

546
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:30,500
that more than I'd ever imagined,

547
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,033
the world of lingerie is wide.

548
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,800
Lingerie is interesting.

549
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,133
No job could be more fun.

550
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:52,433
Yes.

551
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:57,633
There's no way I could quit.

552
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,000
Don't you think?

553
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,133
Until the assignment of business
and ownership change is complete,

554
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,933
we can't open the shop.

555
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,100
I understand, but there's no point
unless we have the merchandise.

556
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:39,300
Will you two stop fighting
over every little detail?

557
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,233
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

558
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:48,267
What? Dad's coming too?

559
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:52,533
Okay, bye.

560
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:21,933
That's right.

561
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:29,267
Today's appointment is at 2:00 p.m.

562
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:42,933
Beautiful.

563
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,233
Beautiful!

564
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,200
{\an8}THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
