1
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,821
-You eat hot pot?
-I love eating hot pot.

2
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,865
You must have very strong teeth!

3
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,785
You eat what goes inside?
You should've said so.

4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,371
I thought you ate the pot itself.

5
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,957
Of course I don't. I eat what goes inside.

6
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,961
-What do you put in hot pot?
-There are many famous recipes.

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,920
Really?

8
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,090
-The most popular is chicken.
-Chicken?

9
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,306
...they arrived at the beach.

10
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,936
The turtle is crying
because he has to say goodbye.

11
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,313
-Thank you slimy much.
-Thank you <i>slimy</i> much?

12
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,817
He talks a lot for a turtle.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,194
Now he's all alone at the beach.

14
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,698
Nobody's looking.

15
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,159
The princess told you not to open the box!

16
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,327
He opened it!

17
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,371
You'll turn into an old man!

18
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,957
You became me?! Thank you.

19
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,506
-Sparks, it's time.
-Thank you.

20
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,472
We warmed them up perfectly
for your last show.

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,724
Yeah, right.

22
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,227
-We only heard nervous laughter.
-They nearly wet themselves.

23
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,396
Big bro...

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,037
Hello!

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,335
-Hello!
-Hello.

26
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,464
Thank you.

27
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,382
We have a packed house.

28
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,884
How nice of everyone to come.

29
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,094
-Thank you.
-We sure are grateful.

30
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,305
Let's do our trademark gag together.

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,389
Ready?

32
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,266
-You've never done that before.

33
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,643
Never!

34
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,977
"Trademark"?

35
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,147
Why did you make a squid shape?
It has nothing to do with us.

36
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,274
-But she joined in.
-Why?!

37
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,985
She's quick. Wow.

38
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,822
More importantly, Yamashita.
Which act should we do today?

39
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,033
Don't ask me now. Ask me backstage.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,662
We have 100 acts to choose from.
Which shall we do?

41
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,873
We're not backstage anymore.
You should have decided beforehand.

42
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,626
Let's start with "Supermarket"
and finish with "House Hunting."

43
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,835
The details?!

44
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,922
Are you sharing the details with everyone?

45
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,964
That's not a good idea.

46
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,008
-Can I say something?
-What?

47
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,843
I had a goal.

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,180
I wanted to revolutionize <i>manzai.</i>
I wanted to blow people away.

49
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,640
-Yep.
-But in the end...

50
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,600
I got blown away.

51
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,144
I discovered that hard work
doesn't pay off.

52
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,521
Poor you!

53
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,106
That's so sad.

54
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,148
All that hard work...

55
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,566
You'll make us cry.

56
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,071
Stop trying to make us cry!
Snap out of it.

57
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:21,159
Sometimes I get so emotional,
it's hard to put my feelings into words.

58
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,285
I know what you mean.

59
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,996
When that happens,
you should tell people this:

60
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,666
"I'm going to say
the opposite of how I feel."

61
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,168
That means you can yell out
the exact opposite

62
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,712
and people will understand
your true feelings.

63
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,257
Why do you always make things
so complicated?

64
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,217
Try it. You'll see.

65
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,761
-Everything is the opposite? Okay.
-Here I go.

66
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,267
-Yamashita!
-What?

67
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,145
You're really good at <i>manzai!</i>

68
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,314
That sounded nice,
but you mean the opposite!

69
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,941
You never stutter.

70
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,402
You look good. Sound good.
Your family is rich, too.

71
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,655
-You're the best partner ever!
-You're trashing me!

72
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,490
Genius!

73
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,410
Genius!

74
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,828
Stop it!

75
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,167
You're trashing me.

76
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,502
You're trashing me at the very end.

77
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,880
But there's more to Yamashita.

78
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,425
-I mean "atihsamaY."
-Don't say "Yamashita" backwards.

79
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,927
Even though you're such a genius,

80
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,637
you have a few flaws.

81
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,723
I have few of them?
Tell me.

82
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,685
-Your room is messy.
-There wasn't anything better?

83
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,229
-You're stiff.
-I am flexible.

84
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,522
That's the best you can do?

85
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,524
You're a slow-eating small-eater.

86
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,568
I eat lots and I do it quick.

87
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,779
I love seconds, too.

88
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,155
-You... like... food?

89
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,531
I sound like an idiot.

90
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,909
Say something better.

91
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,369
And don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

92
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,498
And you can't touch dogs.

93
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,916
I can touch dogs.

94
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,794
Most people can. That's nothing special.

95
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,796
He really, really can't touch dogs.

96
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,756
I really, really can touch dogs.

97
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,049
That is nothing special!

98
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,302
He can't touch dogs so much,
the police didn't come.

99
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,262
I touched dogs so much, the police came.

100
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,639
No, they didn't.

101
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,016
"There's a guy who keeps touching dogs..."

102
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,019
Don't tell the cops I touch dogs too much.

103
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,522
You know me. Say something nice.

104
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,107
He lacks a sex drive.

105
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,526
Snap out of it.

106
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,695
You know. Tell them nice stuff about me.

107
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,239
He really lacks a sex drive.

108
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,824
I have a really strong... Hey!

109
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,950
Something else!

110
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,077
He lacks a sex drive so much,
the police didn't--

111
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,578
Enough with the sex drive!

112
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,871
"He's not moving--"

113
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,164
Don't call the cops!

114
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,541
"But his sex drive--"

115
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,126
Why do you always call the cops?
Snap out of it.

116
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,463
There are better things
you could say about me.

117
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,468
-His girlfriend is ugly.
-She's cute...

118
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,554
That's not about me! She is cute.

119
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,265
She never does anything for you.

120
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,809
She's not kind.
She's the worst woman ever!

121
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,562
She is beautiful.

122
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,482
And when your twins are born,
they'll be ugly, too.

123
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,317
They're gonna be super cute.

124
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,281
And your partner is amazingly talented.

125
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,992
Don't say that.

126
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,869
He is amazingly talented.

127
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,664
Your partner is a genius.

128
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,083
But for the past 10 years,

129
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,002
all you ever did was complain.

130
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,588
You didn't trust him at all!

131
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,842
Don't say that!

132
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,555
We were together for the past 10 years,

133
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,307
but I didn't enjoy it at all!

134
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,185
It was so not fun.

135
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,404
I didn't enjoy doing <i>manzai</i> with you.

136
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,996
I am...

137
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,291
I'm the unluckiest guy in the world!

138
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,339
And you!

139
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,674
You guys!

140
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,926
You are so smart.

141
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,847
You found a duo so famous,
with such a bright future.

142
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,141
You didn't pay a thing to see their shows!

143
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,935
You are so smart!

144
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,980
It's thanks to you...

145
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,067
we were in pain, every day!

146
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,360
Assholes!

147
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,445
He means the opposite.

148
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,284
I had a dream.

149
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,495
Ever since I was a kid.

150
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,706
I didn't want to be a <i>manzai</i> artist.

151
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,543
I swore I'd never become a <i>manzai</i> artist!

152
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,796
But what happened?

153
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,217
I met my partner back
in elementary school.

154
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,052
And I became a <i>manzai</i> artist!

155
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,262
My life sucks!

156
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,516
It's all his fault.

157
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,725
I died.

158
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,230
It's like this guy killed me!

159
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,442
-Right, murderer?
-Tone it down.

160
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,194
Tone it down.

161
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,073
Every now and then,

162
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,576
people would say we were really good.

163
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,912
That made me so happy.

164
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,330
It was like...

165
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,543
They gave me so much joy.

166
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,214
It was like they were saying
"yes" to my entire life.

167
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,218
They would make me so happy.

168
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,929
I was so happy.

169
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,932
But!

170
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,768
Some people came and ruined it.

171
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,562
You guys!

172
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,188
I hate you!

173
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,940
I hate you!

174
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,900
I hate you all!

175
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,403
Damn you!

176
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,239
"Sparks is shit!"

177
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,491
"I never want to see them again!"
That's what you said.

178
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,411
You said "no" to our whole lives.

179
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,330
That pissed me off so much.

180
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,959
I was so pissed off.

181
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,254
I hate you.

182
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,881
I hate you!

183
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,258
I hate you all!

184
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,760
Hate!

185
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,682
We'll always be Sparks!

186
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,019
Today isn't the last day
we'll ever do <i>manzai!</i>

187
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,607
We'll see you like this,
every day, forever!

188
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,609
That makes me so very happy!

189
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,863
These past 10 years won't help me live on!

190
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,740
And so!

191
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,200
I beg you all!

192
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,618
Go die somewhere!

193
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,205
Die!

194
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,289
Die!

195
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,208
Die! Die! Die!

196
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,125
Die...

197
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,585
Die!

198
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,337
Die...

199
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,510
Die...

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,434
Die.

201
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,063
Die! Die! Die!

202
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,022
Die!

203
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,023
Die!

204
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,234
You, too! Die!

205
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,571
Die alone, away from your family!

206
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,282
I hope everyone in your family dies!

207
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,200
Be miserable!

208
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,036
Be the most miserable guy I know!

209
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,788
Shut up already!

210
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,414
Shut up!

211
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,458
How abusive can you get?

212
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,961
What is this <i>manzai?</i>

213
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,587
You made the audience cry.

214
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,965
You made me cry way before them.

215
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,052
You're supposed to make people laugh
with <i>manzai.</i>

216
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,303
What is this?!

217
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,806
This <i>manzai</i> is so wrong.

218
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,724
So, we finally did it.

219
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,185
We made a revolution in <i>manzai.</i>

220
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,563
Shut up. What a mouth.

221
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,190
Don't you have something to say?

222
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,068
Huh?

223
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,320
It's our last <i>manzai.</i>

224
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,574
Don't you have anything to say?!

225
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,951
Partner...

226
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,911
Our audience...

227
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,748
I'd like to say...

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,085
I owe you nothing at all!

229
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,050
You asshole--

230
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,844
I meant the opposite.

231
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,638
I was talking in opposites.
You knew what I meant.

232
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,515
They all knew.

233
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,058
I only know one thing.

234
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,226
What do you know?

235
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,644
You're really good at <i>manzai.</i>

236
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,938
I've had enough. Thank you.

237
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:55,715
HIBANA
- Spark -

238
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,939
That's too high.

239
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,568
That's too high, too.

240
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,737
It's all done.

241
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,825
Toku-chan...

242
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,203
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,704
What for?

244
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,332
I'm looking forward to seeing your kids.

245
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,125
Thanks.

246
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,087
We're out.

247
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,258
Bye.

248
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,226
Look after yourself.

249
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,522
Bye.

250
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,710
It's a waste for you to quit, too.

251
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,172
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,553
Your decision's made?

253
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,471
Yes.

254
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,065
What are you gonna do?

255
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,154
Our boss hooked me up with a job
at a real estate agency.

256
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,364
I see.

257
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,289
Tokunaga...

258
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,374
Yes?

259
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,668
In my opinion...

260
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,839
there's no such thing as retirement
for comedians.

261
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,467
Sometimes I wonder:

262
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,845
"If I was the only <i>manzai</i> artist
in the world,

263
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,599
would I have tried this hard?"

264
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,854
We were surrounded by
so many amazing people.

265
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,358
They forced us to do something different,
or pick up from where they left off.

266
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,195
Thanks to those people,
we were forced to think.

267
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
In the end,
it's like we all worked together.

268
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,537
But amongst those people,
there's a clear difference between

269
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,081
those who make it big,
and those who don't.

270
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,296
It's a gigantic competition.

271
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,216
There are winners and losers.

272
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,676
That's what makes it fun.

273
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,767
But, Tokunaga...

274
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,605
Those who get weeded out...

275
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,858
they have a purpose, too!

276
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,490
Everyone who's ever been on stage...

277
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,285
they needed to be there.

278
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,624
The <i>manzai</i> of the future...

279
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,170
we've been a part of it.

280
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,134
You did it.

281
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,846
For 10 years.

282
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,183
You thought about funny things
all that time.

283
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,645
On top of that, you kept going on stage.

284
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,189
You made people laugh.

285
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,948
There were times when nobody laughed.

286
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,620
Sometimes.

287
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,043
But you made people laugh all that time.

288
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,880
What does that mean?

289
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,343
You've given yourself
an amazing specialized ability.

290
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,929
Like a boxer's punch.

291
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,848
A boxer?

292
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,477
Even boxers that aren't famous
can kill people easily.

293
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,271
Same with comedians.

294
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,148
The only difference is:

295
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,987
The more comedians punch,
the more we make people happy.

296
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,659
So...

297
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,412
even if you quit...

298
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,833
Even if you make a living
doing some other job...

299
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,377
keep punching the hell out of people.

300
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,297
Nobody else has a punch like you.

301
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,556
Thank you.

302
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,325
SOWA REAL ESTATE

303
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,829
-I'm back.
-Hi.

304
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,218
Nice timing.

305
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,845
We've got customers.

306
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,847
They want to see the property.

307
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,141
Can you handle it?

308
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,142
Sure.

309
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,437
The 40,000 place. Nothing special.

310
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,275
Can you believe that guy with short hair?

311
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,528
"Is your budget around 80,000?"

312
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,240
This way.

313
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,909
It's rusty.

314
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:03,744
It's so old.

315
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,498
It is a little old,
but it's quite spacious for the price.

316
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,002
Take a look around.

317
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,421
Thank you.

318
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,850
Wow.

319
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,319
Hey!

320
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,447
Look!

321
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,574
It's a "knee-bending latrine"!

322
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,617
It's just an old squat toilet.

323
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,454
You can exercise while you crap. How cool!

324
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,330
I don't exercise when I crap.

325
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,125
I can crap in the middle of any exercise.

326
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,085
If you miss your target,
it will be a disaster.

327
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,842
We are...

328
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,844
We want to be comedians.

329
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,431
If we find a place, we'll come to Tokyo.

330
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,183
-I see.
-Yeah.

331
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,103
Is it okay to practice <i>manzai</i> here?

332
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,064
You might have to keep it down.

333
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,944
I think it would be better
to practice outside.

334
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,738
Outside?!

335
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
Keep it down!

336
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,532
-He just told you.
-Sorry.

337
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,619
If you're going to be comedians,
I do recommend this place.

338
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,454
-Why?
-Well...

339
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,708
Nearby, you have Wadabori Park.
It's really big.

340
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,834
A park?

341
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,337
You can practice your acts
without worrying there.

342
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,215
You seem to know
a lot about comedians.

343
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,966
Are you a big fan?

344
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,135
No, not really.

345
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,846
We'll definitely make it big! Root for us!

346
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,139
Keep it down!

347
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,974
-You're not the straight man.
-Sorry.

348
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,937
Welcome.

349
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,731
Hey. Over here.

350
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,028
-Sorry I'm late.
-Long time no see.

351
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,447
Look at you.

352
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,991
It's been ages.

353
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,080
-Coffee.
-Sure thing.

354
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,374
You're working properly.

355
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,543
You're an adult.

356
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,254
Why did you call me?

357
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,089
Well, you see...

358
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,008
I wondered if you knew where he went.

359
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,929
Who's "he"? Do you mean your faithful dog?

360
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,222
Dog?

361
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,393
What? You're not wearing a <i>yukata</i>?

362
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,103
I'm not Saigo Takamori.

363
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,813
-Your shoes...
-Stop kidding around.

364
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,900
I look nothing like the Last Samurai.
Stop messing with me.

365
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,152
This is serious.

366
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,362
Welcome.

367
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,114
Kamiya has...

368
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,116
No way!

369
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,909
No way!

370
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,160
What?

371
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,123
For real? Next to us?

372
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,874
-Right next to us?
-What is it?

373
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,459
Why sit next to us?

374
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,128
Mr. Kamiya?

375
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,921
Yeah. It's him.

376
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,799
It's all his fault.

377
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,595
He stopped coming to work
and I can't contact him.

378
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,514
-What about his apartment?
-He's long gone.

379
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,349
He's done a runner.

380
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,728
His debt...

381
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,813
It's about 10 million yen.

382
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,151
Give me a break.

383
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,987
There are lots of rumors.

384
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,449
Some say he's working on
a long-distance fishing boat.

385
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,660
Others say he joined
the homosexual porn industry.

386
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,121
It's too much.

387
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,915
Why do I have to go through this?

388
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,877
I don't even know if he's alive.

389
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,048
Someone found his sandal in Tokyo Bay.
Sounds like <i>My Neighbor Totoro.</i>

390
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,549
Wait up.

391
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,051
I'm out.

392
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,218
Can you pay?

393
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,512
Sorry.

394
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,765
See ya. I'll call again.

395
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,308
This horse won.

396
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,851
Cash in the ticket.

397
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:01,523
Hey!

398
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,233
Hey, you!

399
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,322
-Come here!
-Give me a break!

400
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,908
Let me go!

401
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,370
It's Kamiya you want.
Chase him!

402
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,164
TOKYO RACECOURSE
NO. 11 - ¥10,000

403
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,091
Mr. Shibata.

404
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,552
Can I borrow the car?

405
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,394
-Thanks.
-Drive carefully.

406
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,311
Sure.

407
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,479
KICHIJOJI STATION

408
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,685
I fixed it.

409
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,440
The trick to love is:

410
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,609
You need to be both honest and deceitful.

411
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,903
Otherwise, it's lukewarm. Right?

412
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,288
Give me a round of applause.
Ready, go.

413
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,252
Look at the balloon!

414
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,854
Ahondara. (Boofhead.)

415
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,202
<i>That child will become</i>
<i>the happiest kid on Earth.</i>

416
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,915
<i>No matter who says what...</i>

417
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,710
<i>Maki's life is beautiful.</i>

418
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,674
<i>I felt really happy.</i>

419
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,303
Hello.

420
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,804
Welcome.

421
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:44,806
Long time no see.

422
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,975
I've been busy with work.

423
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,271
You wear that suit well now.

424
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,192
So, please...

425
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,863
-For me?
-No, your daughter.

426
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,868
I don't know if she'll like it.

427
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,287
Thank you.

428
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,835
What would you like?

429
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,629
Coffee.

430
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,589
Coffee it is.

431
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,394
One more.

432
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,045
INCOMING CALL
NUMBER WITHHELD

433
00:29:59,006 --> 00:29:59,881
Hello?

434
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,879
Welcome.

435
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,883
-I have someone waiting for me.
-Go ahead.

436
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,683
Hello.

437
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,328
Drink up.

438
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,257
Today I went to the agency and apologized.

439
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,676
But they won't have me.

440
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,428
Of course they won't.

441
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,391
My debt grew too big.

442
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,684
I had no other choice.

443
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,021
I went back to Osaka.
Ran around. Made some money.

444
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,232
Did you pay everyone back?

445
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,112
In the end, I filed for bankruptcy.

446
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,864
I gave what I could
to the more dangerous guys.

447
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,848
What are they?

448
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,438
F-cup boobs.

449
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,652
What are you doing?

450
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,825
If you're gonna have breasts,
the bigger, the funnier.

451
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,326
I put in heaps of silicone.

452
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,288
You see...

453
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,167
I was always against creating a persona.

454
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,919
But I had it wrong.

455
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,424
If you're not funnier than your persona,
that's your fault.

456
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,885
No.

457
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,470
It won't work.

458
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,306
All I see are your breasts.

459
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,933
Why?!

460
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,685
It's funny!

461
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,189
I'm gonna take these on TV.

462
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,154
No, you won't.

463
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,867
Who would laugh at
a middle-aged man's big breasts?

464
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,580
When I did it...

465
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,334
I thought it was so funny.

466
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,252
I kept laughing to myself.

467
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,755
But...

468
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,675
I went to see my only friend
at the agency.

469
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,513
When I told him I wanted to be on TV
with these...

470
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,306
he freaked out.

471
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,233
And then...

472
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,113
And then...

473
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,535
I started thinking...

474
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,622
All of a sudden...

475
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,667
I got scared.

476
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,465
What are you doing?

477
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,429
What are you doing?

478
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,684
I messed things up beyond repair.

479
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,021
Now I'm scared.

480
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,485
But...

481
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,156
I thought...

482
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,076
I thought you would laugh.

483
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,997
It's not funny.

484
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,254
Tokunaga.

485
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,465
What should I do?

486
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,223
I can't be on TV with these, right?

487
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,982
Mr. Kamiya.

488
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,861
You know what?

489
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,740
I think...

490
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,789
I know you didn't mean any harm.

491
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,170
"If a middle-aged man had big breasts,
that would be funny."

492
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,007
I think that's all you were thinking.

493
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,677
However...

494
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,598
society has problems.

495
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,434
Problems regarding sex.

496
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,272
Problems regarding people's
attitudes towards gender.

497
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,567
There are many people out there suffering.

498
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,112
What about them?

499
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,908
What would they think
if they saw you like this?

500
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,580
They would be offended.

501
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,667
They would, right?

502
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,921
Even though that wasn't your intention.

503
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,931
The people who are suffering...

504
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,601
and their families...

505
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,520
their friends...

506
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,231
These people exist.

507
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,569
They don't know you.

508
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,323
If they saw you...

509
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,453
they might think you're a weirdo
making fun of them.

510
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,913
Tokunaga!

511
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,624
Stop telling me this.

512
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,459
I know.

513
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,922
I really am an idiot.

514
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,299
What should I do?

515
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,845
You thought giving a man
big breasts would be funny,

516
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,139
but there are problems
regarding gender.

517
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,891
I know they are two different things...

518
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,186
but people won't realize the difference.

519
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,401
What you've done, Mr. Kamiya...

520
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,112
It is unacceptable.

521
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,994
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,080
I just...

523
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,166
You see...

524
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,586
for so many years...

525
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,965
you're the only one who said I was funny.

526
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,091
That's why.

527
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,929
I wanted to make everyone else say
I was funny, too.

528
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,347
But...

529
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,185
But...

530
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,440
I didn't know how to do it.

531
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,233
And then...

532
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,528
before I knew it...

533
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,116
I had big tits.

534
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,081
And now

535
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,459
I really regret it.

536
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,843
I truly am sorry!

537
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,603
What...

538
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,150
What the hell?!

539
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,241
What the hell?!

540
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,210
What the hell!

541
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,398
Tokunaga...

542
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,694
I'm sorry we can't go to the public bath
together.

543
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,656
Which should I go in?

544
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,324
The men's, of course.

545
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,244
But...

546
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,753
-Your hook will be perfect with this.
-Hey. Stop it.

547
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,259
But...

548
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,722
if I go in the bath, won't everyone panic?

549
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,182
I would hate to trouble anyone.

550
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,894
You're a genius at giving people trouble.

551
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,983
<i>The next fireworks are</i>
<i>Atami City's specialty:</i>

552
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,152
<i>"The Digital Star Mine."</i>

553
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,788
This is life.

554
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,915
<i>Now for our "Message Fireworks":</i>

555
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,751
<i>To Koji, from Yoko.</i>

556
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,504
<i>"This year is our 25th anniversary.</i>

557
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,091
<i>I hope we get a lot older together.</i>

558
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,842
<i>Thanks for everything."</i>

559
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,308
<i>Now for our next message:</i>

560
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,437
<i>From Kentaro Koyama, to Chie Yoshihara.</i>

561
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,692
<i>"Chie-chan. Thanks for everything.</i>

562
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,819
<i>Let's get married."</i>

563
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,912
Thank you.

564
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,206
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

565
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,840
Fireworks, huh?

566
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:56,764
They belong to people
who live positive, decent lives.

567
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,393
<i>Our next fireworks will be</i>
<i>full of color and emotion.</i>

568
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:04,397
<i>Please enjoy the beautiful flashes</i>
<i>across the night sky.</i>

569
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,948
Shall we go back?

570
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:17,869
Yeah.

571
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,033
Here you go.

572
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,743
Eat up.

573
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,914
You haven't changed a bit.

574
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,959
We came here 10 years ago.

575
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,503
Do you remember us?

576
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,630
Oh, really...

577
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,839
Here on holiday?

578
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,050
I'm a local god.

579
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,311
Something's not right.

580
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,814
That cracked her up 10 years ago.

581
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,608
-It did?
-Yeah, you remember.

582
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,527
If you say so.

583
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,823
Number 82!

584
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,366
Here you go.

585
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,034
What does that mean?

586
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,828
There's no meaning.

587
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,288
Eight and two?

588
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,833
Your birthday isn't August 2nd...

589
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,962
In Japanese baccarat,
8 and 2 make a "pig."

590
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,463
The crappiest hand.

591
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,381
But...

592
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,342
you get to draw one more card, right?

593
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,637
That's right. You can draw three cards.

594
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,638
Yep.

595
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,559
Things can't get worse if you have "pig."

596
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,728
Draw one more card!

597
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,025
One more, little lady.

598
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,155
-A highball for the god.
-Coming up!

599
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:22,994
I'll take a leak.

600
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,134
AMATEUR COMEDY CONTEST
WIN 100,000 YEN

601
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,553
Hey, Tokunaga...

602
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,556
The shit has hit the fan.

603
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,391
What is it?

604
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,353
There's a contest tomorrow.

605
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,690
There is.

606
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,693
Let's do it.

607
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,531
Let's compete!

608
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,621
Why not?

609
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,415
We're virtually amateurs.

610
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,333
No way.

611
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,668
And the deadline's already expired.

612
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,129
It'll be fine. Let's do it.

613
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,297
No way.

614
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,842
Okay. I'll think of a routine now.

615
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,010
Okay?

616
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,139
It's my mission, as a local god.

617
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,934
You're still going with that setting?

618
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,185
Okay?

619
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,520
Please. I'm begging you!

620
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,356
Sorry.

621
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,234
Okay.

622
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,945
Come on. Go for it.

623
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,822
-You can touch them.
-Put them away.

624
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,991
It's okay. I don't mind.

625
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,326
Go for it.

626
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,330
-Why are your nipples stiff?
-Because you touched them.

627
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,748
Ow ow ow!

628
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,584
That hurt.

629
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,588
-This will definitely crack 'em up.
-Do you have diarrhea?

630
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,133
-All right.
-Welcome back.

631
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,260
-This'll be funny.
-I'm not doing it.

632
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,846
Why not? Don't be so hardheaded.

633
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,849
-We're gonna compete.
-Enough already.

634
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,851
We don't have to win.

635
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,603
Welcome back.

636
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,488
Can we rent these CDs for free?

637
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,657
Yes, it's a complimentary service.

638
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,450
Let's take something.

639
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,749
Would you have any
Sex Pistols or The Clash albums?

640
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,626
Please let me check.

641
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,838
-That's not your type of music.
-Idiot.

642
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,382
I listen to punk music
all the time lately.

643
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:43,926
I'm sorry.

644
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,970
They're all checked out.

645
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,139
Be careful.

646
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,434
I think you have another
lover of punk amongst your guests.

647
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,853
I'm going up to the room.

648
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,744
I'll make our <i>manzai.</i>

649
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,337
Above Kamiya's head,

650
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,757
a full moon hangs calmly.

651
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,929
The beautiful scene is a peaceful miracle.

652
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,366
<i>Above Kamiya's head,</i>

653
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,536
<i>a full moon hangs calmly.</i>

654
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,831
<i>The beautiful scene is</i>

655
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,542
<i>a peaceful miracle.</i>

656
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,332
The Drum-Drum Man.

657
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,047
The Drum-Drum Man.

658
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,845
The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

659
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,560
Dragon, wake up.
With the sound of the drum.

660
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,026
The Drum-Drum Man.

661
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,821
The Drum-Drum Man.

662
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,450
The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

663
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,412
Dragon, wake up.
With the sound of the drum.

664
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,166
The Drum-Drum Man.

665
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,960
The Drum-Drum Man.

666
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,880
The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

667
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,383
Dragon, wake up!
With the sound of the drum!

668
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,344
The Drum-Drum Man!

669
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,429
The Drum-Drum Man!

670
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,806
The Bright-Red-Hat Man!

671
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,476
Dragon, wake up!
With the sound of the drum!

672
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:26,810
Tokunaga!

673
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,823
<i>Mr. Kamiya is here.</i>

674
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,867
<i>He exists.</i>

675
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,454
<i>His heart beats.</i>

676
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,207
<i>He breathes.</i>

677
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,085
<i>He is here.</i>

678
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,423
<i>Mr. Kamiya...</i>

679
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,468
<i>He lives with all his heart and soul.</i>

680
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,180
<i>As long as he's alive...</i>

681
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,183
<i>there will be no bad end.</i>

682
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,355
<i>We still have a lot to do.</i>

683
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,361
We still have a lot to do.
