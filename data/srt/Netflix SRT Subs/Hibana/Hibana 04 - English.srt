1
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,748
Welcome.

2
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,091
Gimme the money.
Hurry up!

3
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,763
Cut!

4
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,182
-Hey!
-Yes?

5
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,851
-What is this?!
-He's trying.

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,646
It's nothing like the original.

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll talk to him.

8
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:04,773
Director coming.

9
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,775
The writer will be furious!

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,862
Can't you be a little more
"whoa-whoa-whoa"?!

11
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,323
He's pointing a knife at you.

12
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,868
In the comic, the thief vroooms in,
and it's vrammm!

13
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,830
-Haven't you read it?
-I read them all.

14
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,498
Why can't you do it?

15
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,791
Sorry.

16
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,544
You were great.
Why apologize?

17
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,629
We're a duo.

18
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,923
You're a duo?
Who cares?!

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,550
Do it properly!

20
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,843
We're losing daylight!

21
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,931
HIBANA
- Spark -

22
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>I was thinking of you</i>
<i>No text message would do</i>

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>So I wrote you a letter</i>
<i>I thought you'd like it better</i>

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,816
FALL, 2002

25
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:52,779
<i>I wrote you a letter</i>
<i>I thought you'd like it better</i>

26
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,282
<i>But you thought I was creepy</i>

27
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,492
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,828
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

29
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

31
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

32
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,671
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

33
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,757
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

34
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>You were on my mind</i>
<i>All of the time</i>

35
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:21,642
<i>I wondered what I could do</i>
<i>To give these feelings to you</i>

36
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>So I bought a guitar</i>
<i>And I chose my clothes</i>

37
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:31,276
<i>It took me all night long</i>
<i>But I wrote you a love song</i>

38
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,822
<i>I wrote you a love song</i>
<i>What could go wrong?</i>

39
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,369
<i>I wrote you a love song</i>
<i>What could go wrong?</i>

40
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,330
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

41
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,749
<i>You thought I was creepy</i>

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,359
Welcome!

43
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,281
Can I have a Shochu-Oolong and...

44
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,825
a skewer set.

45
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,869
Please eat this.

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,335
Thanks, as always.

47
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,045
Thanks.

48
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,175
I think it's time
we put an end to this.

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,845
But...

50
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,014
Don't say that.

51
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,688
I really don't like this.

52
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,403
No matter what?

53
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,864
Sorry.

54
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,825
I see.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,077
Here's your Shochu-Oolong.

56
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,376
But, I think...

57
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,338
It's a good story.

58
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,759
When you're a big star,

59
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,764
you can tell everyone how you
asked people to be a fake audience.

60
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,019
Good point.

61
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,404
Um...

62
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,575
Are we...

63
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,789
We're friends, right?

64
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,794
Yes.

65
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,796
I mean...
Sorry.

66
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,799
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

67
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,804
-Friends.
-Friends.

68
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,139
STAFF WANTED

69
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,808
Part-time?

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,143
Yes.

71
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,270
You are.

72
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,108
You are?

73
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,945
I'm here for an interview.

74
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,531
How old are you?

75
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,782
I'm 23.

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,243
So I'm younger than you.

77
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,957
But I've been here longer.
I'm your superior. Get it?

78
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes.

79
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,210
Yes, I understand.

80
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,128
I understand.

81
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,381
-Be cool.
-Thank you.

82
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,593
-What's your name?
-I'm Tokunaga.

83
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,476
For part-timers, the late shift's
better than the day one.

84
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,811
It is?

85
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:55,897
May I ask why?

86
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,524
May I ask why?

87
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,901
A 100 yen per hour difference.

88
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,112
So, 700 yen becomes 800 yen.

89
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,448
Sounds good.

90
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,826
See how it's better?

91
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,413
-I'll do the late shift.
-Good idea.

92
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,707
We'll be together.

93
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,128
On the late shift?

94
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,590
The late shift.

95
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,841
The late shift...

96
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,509
-What?
-Thank you.

97
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,428
Thanks for filling me in.

98
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,762
Sorry.

99
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,267
The manager's a real tight-ass.

100
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,810
He is?

101
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,813
Did something happen?

102
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,818
When the money doesn't add up,
he gets a bit anal.

103
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,945
Really anal.

104
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,824
And don't leave your stuff
in the staff room.

105
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,492
Like, your wallet.

106
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,244
Really?

107
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,333
Sato, your break's over.
It ended three minutes ago.

108
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,838
I'm going.

109
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,595
Sorry about the wait.

110
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,805
Let's look at your résumé.

111
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,521
"Hyuga Agency"?

112
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,690
It's a talent agency.

113
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,817
-You're an actor?
-I'm a comedian.

114
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,861
A comedian...

115
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,657
-That must be tough.
-It is.

116
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,743
Only a few can make ends meet.

117
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,869
That's true.

118
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,707
It's great to follow your dream,
but aren't your parents worried?

119
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,833
I guess...

120
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,837
You have to face reality.

121
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,425
You don't approve?

122
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:54,015
I admit that I trouble my parents
and make them worry, but...

123
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,061
Sorry, that was uncalled for.
I mean...

124
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,438
I was an actor myself.

125
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,649
I quit when I became a dad.

126
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,025
But that's why...

127
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,904
I understand what you're going through.
That's why...

128
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,782
No, it's my fault.
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,410
-Sorry.
-Forget about it.

130
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,621
Oh, you do <i>manzai?</i>

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,707
What kind?

132
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,917
What type of <i>manzai</i> is it?

133
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,753
Well...

134
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,798
We don't suck up to the audience.

135
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,718
You get the laughs?

136
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,511
Yes. Quite a lot.

137
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,555
Wow. That's great.

138
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,269
Can you start next week?

139
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,729
I can.

140
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,940
I'll contact you
when I've made the schedule.

141
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,775
Thank you.

142
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,532
-Tokunaga.
-Yes?

143
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,702
You might not like this,
but there will be girls tonight.

144
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,499
A little bro from my agency
thought he'd do us a favor.

145
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,960
Okay.

146
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,093
-For real?
-I swear!

147
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,721
It became
the most popular menu ever.

148
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,349
-It sounds gross.
-But I swear it tastes great!

149
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,312
Are you okay?

150
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,776
Sorry, I have to go to the toilet.

151
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,403
Me, too.

152
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,782
You making it my lucky night?

153
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,492
No, we're not.

154
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,079
If you don't hurry back,
there'll be trouble.

155
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,581
That's assault.

156
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,667
Hugging them is okay.
Making them squeeze you isn't.

157
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,919
You're getting turned on.

158
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,798
Oh, you're doing the squeezing now.

159
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,821
Sorry.

160
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,282
I think you can get
the girl next to you.

161
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,784
You think so?

162
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,494
Not your type?

163
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,249
I didn't come for the girls.
I came for Mr. Kamiya's company.

164
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,794
Mr. Tokunaga, you sure are different.

165
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,796
A little strange, in fact.

166
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,006
Just like Mr. Kamiya said.

167
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,974
Tokunaga is back!

168
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,685
It's time to change seats.

169
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,271
Mai-chan and Haruko-chan, swap!

170
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,522
-Sure.
-Sure.

171
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,818
I'll go there.

172
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,371
Where are you sitting?!

173
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,499
Why?

174
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,794
What's he doing?

175
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,963
It's okay.
You sit there.

176
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,800
Did I offend him or something?

177
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,138
It's like he's still in junior high.

178
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,806
I know what you mean.

179
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,308
You're just shy, right?

180
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,979
Don't be fooled.
He's a serial eavesdropper.

181
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,648
Right?

182
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:31,900
Yep.

183
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,818
What a weirdo!

184
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,986
Creepy.

185
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,196
Does he bug people's rooms?

186
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,450
He doesn't use bugs or wires.

187
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,784
What does he do?

188
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,578
He roams the streets at night.

189
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,040
When he hears a girl moaning,
he goes and listens.

190
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,751
He's a pervert.

191
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,130
He stayed outside one house
listening for 20 minutes.

192
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,716
-He's a total creeper.
-Definitely a creeper.

193
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,344
Does that turn you on?

194
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,511
Yes.

195
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,724
The subject emits the sound without
intending it to be heard by a third party.

196
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,768
Theoretically, one shouldn't hear it.

197
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,855
He sounds like a professor.

198
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,442
"Theoretically, one shouldn't hear it."

199
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,490
He sounds like a professor,
but his T-shirt says "Pops."

200
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,241
It's cute!

201
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,744
Just hide it.

202
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,830
-His cardigan's skintight!
-Totally skintight!

203
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,916
Why hide it?
Show us your "Pops."

204
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,919
It's so tight,
he can't do the buttons up.

205
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,755
How did you end up with that?
It's too small!

206
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,548
He took it off!

207
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,883
"Pops" is back!

208
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,514
So...

209
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,893
Do you think we might meet again?

210
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,188
That's not why I came.

211
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,900
I see.

212
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,904
-Thanks for dinner.
-It was nothing.

213
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,156
Thank you.

214
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,618
-Could we take a photo?
-Okay.

215
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,745
-Me, too!
-Photo time!

216
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,206
-May I join in?
-Let's take one all together.

217
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,709
-I'll take it.
-Thank you.

218
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,210
Squeeze in.

219
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,587
-Three, two, one...
-Say something funny.

220
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,755
I got nothing.

221
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,427
It's out of focus!

222
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,303
-Take one more?
-Yes, please.

223
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,860
-Eavesdropping again tonight?
-Please don't say things like that.

224
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,487
-But they laughed.
-At me, not with me.

225
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,743
"Don't be laughed at.
You gotta make 'em laugh!"

226
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,828
That big brother advice
should've stayed backstage.

227
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,873
It's a shame those words
became so well-known.

228
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:57,628
Now the public's wised up,
we can't play the fool so easily.

229
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,424
Audiences think:
"That guy's just pretending to be stupid."

230
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,885
But they were better off ignorant.

231
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,848
So now we are judged
by a new set of standards.

232
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:14,228
It was fine when they simply thought,
"That guy's stupid!" and laughed.

233
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,775
Now we have an audience
aware they're being made to laugh.

234
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,693
What a shame.

235
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:27,492
But won't new standards
force us to be more creative?

236
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,454
There's some truth to that.

237
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:36,709
But it's like too many colors have been
painted on top of a masterpiece.

238
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,337
Now everyone's completely lost.

239
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,465
As for you...

240
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,803
You haven't even realized
you're funny.

241
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,262
That's perfect.

242
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,723
You're saying I'm an idiot.

243
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,100
Shut up.

244
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,417
Mr. Kamiya.

245
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,796
You and Ms. Maki are a couple,
aren't you?

246
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,840
Nope.

247
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,843
She just lets me live there.

248
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,263
I thought she was your girlfriend.

249
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,849
You did, huh?

250
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,853
Don't you like her?

251
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,859
You remind me of my days
back at school.

252
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,405
If I went to college,
I'd still be in my 4th year.

253
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,740
If you say so.

254
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,868
But...

255
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,829
I don't pay any rent.

256
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,792
And she does a lot for me,
so I want to do right by her.

257
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,255
But try going out with me for real.
It'd be hell.

258
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,175
-You're right.
-You're supposed to contradict me!

259
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,847
Maki...

260
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,767
Every time I tell her
I'm going somewhere with you,

261
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,853
she gives me money.

262
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,317
So, as far as she knows,
I go out with you every day.

263
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,865
Ms. Maki...

264
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,243
Is it true that she works
at a hostess bar?

265
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:41,876
After I moved in, she quit her karaoke job
and started working nights.

266
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,174
Doesn't she want to be official?

267
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,844
She's hinted at it a few times.

268
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,139
I told her to go find
a proper boyfriend.

269
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,766
What did she say?

270
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
"Got it."

271
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,779
That doesn't sound right.

272
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,003
We should be like everyone else?

273
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,757
-No, but simplicity is important.
-I don't need simplicity.

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,926
"Eccentricity" and "talent"
are two different things.

275
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,763
-But abnormality rules.
-Wrong again.

276
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,847
Why?

277
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,017
-Mr. Kamiya's abnormality is a talent.
-You're not him.

278
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,477
I'm not!

279
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,937
I'm too clumsy.

280
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,815
Then make clumsiness your selling point.

281
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,945
-Too clumsy to sell your clumsiness?
-What are you, then?

282
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,365
-What do you mean?
-Whatever.

283
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,992
Why do you guys get so annoying?

284
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,995
We're having an important discussion
about Sparks.

285
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,248
It's not Toku-chan and me here.
It's Sparks.

286
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,794
We're having a very important discussion.

287
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,795
Stir this.

288
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,090
Make up your mind.

289
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,221
It should be on soon.

290
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,182
Yurie, it's time.

291
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,519
Mya-Mya.

292
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,065
-Mya-Mya, it's on.
-She responds to "Mya-Mya"?

293
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,694
We're celebrating tonight.
Let's enjoy it.

294
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,820
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

295
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,948
She's in our agency.

296
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,871
Reika Kuraki. Know her?

297
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,415
Nope.

298
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,959
The girl whose tits you squeezed.

299
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:11,794
What?

300
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,589
<i>When can I see Daddy?</i>

301
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,305
<i>Gimme the money.</i>
<i>Hurry up!</i>

302
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,015
<i>Take it all.</i>
<i>Help.</i>

303
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,395
<i>And a corn dog.</i>

304
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,063
<i>A corn dog!</i>

305
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,819
<i>Ketchup?</i>
<i>Need any ketchup?</i>

306
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,738
<i>-No!</i>
<i>-No ketchup?</i>

307
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,781
<i>-Meatball?</i>
<i>-Meatball? No!</i>

308
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,876
<i>Maiko!</i>

309
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,295
Our roles got switched.

310
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,757
I was the cashier,
and Tokunaga was a customer.

311
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,884
<i>Maiko!</i>

312
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,094
What happened?

313
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,890
I got cut.

314
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,060
What a crap TV show!

315
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,944
But, hey.
You were on TV.

316
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,864
That's a great achievement for Sparks.

317
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,533
Isn't that amazing?

318
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,911
You're right.

319
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,164
Toku-chan,
I'll make some for you.

320
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,582
What do you want?

321
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,668
We've got tuna.
And shrimp.

322
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,046
Salmon...
Whatever you want.

323
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,632
Cucumber.

324
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,844
Cucumber?

325
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,889
-Just cucumber?
-Just cucumber.

326
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,058
Make it for him!

327
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,901
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

328
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,907
Did you record it?

329
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,408
Yep.

330
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,911
You did?
Let's watch it later.

331
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,904
Tokky, serve the customers.

332
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,825
"Tokky"?
Is that me?

333
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,285
See anybody else?

334
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,162
-Hurry up.
-Sorry about the wait.

335
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,791
You want more?

336
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,543
"Bandit Chicken."

337
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,877
-Want some?
-Yeah.

338
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,546
Two of those.

339
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,846
Mr. Sato, I'm sorry.
Bandit Chicken...

340
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,265
Which button is it?

341
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,850
Sorry.

342
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,311
Thank you.

343
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,313
I taught you the other day.

344
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,857
Once should be enough.

345
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,817
Hurry up.

346
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,777
You forgot?

347
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,862
Sorry.

348
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,574
If you can't remember,
why not take notes?

349
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,868
-We're in a rush.
-Okay.

350
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,870
Get the chicken.

351
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,876
This is the last time, so listen.
Press "Blanker."

352
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,836
Then the number of pieces--

353
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,838
-Hey. Teach him later.
-Got it?

354
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,131
-Hurry up.
-Sorry.

355
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,884
That's a total of 1,366 yen.

356
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,230
Your 634 yen change.

357
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,903
Shall I separate the warm things?

358
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,785
No, this'll do.

359
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,913
Tokky, don't make them wait.

360
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,749
It was your fault.

361
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,923
Don't do it.
Let's go.

362
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,716
Come on.

363
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:28,926
Let's go.

364
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,683
Tokky.

365
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,395
With your slowness,
I'm worried for your future.

366
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,066
You earn 600 yen an hour.

367
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,943
Yes.

368
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,116
Hello?

369
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,409
Excuse me.

370
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,703
You're from Sparks...

371
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,663
-Tokunaga.
-You're Tokunaga, right?

372
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,166
-I saw you at the show in Shibuya.
-Thank you.

373
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,293
Keep up the good work.

374
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,921
-Thanks.
-Tokunaga from Sparks!

375
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,966
The one without the moles.

376
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,263
-No charisma whatsoever!
-So normal.

377
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,933
Oops. Hello?

378
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,567
It's the name of my duo.
"Sparks."

379
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,156
I didn't tell you?

380
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,908
I'm a comedian.

381
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,706
You're doing something, huh?

382
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,918
I've done a lot myself.

383
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,475
<i>...all of those missing</i>

384

<i>He was in a Kobe hospital</i>

393
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,045

397
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,513

398
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,391
<i>-I love hot pots.</i>
<i>-You must have very strong teeth.</i>

399
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,895
<i>Which are easier to chew?</i>
<i>Steel or ceramic?</i>

400
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,856
<i>I don't eat the pot.</i>
<i>I eat what goes inside.</i>

401
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,776
<i>What goes inside?</i>
<i>You should've said so first.</i>

402
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,904
<i>-I thought you ate the pot itself.</i>
<i>-Of course I don't.</i>

403
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,865
<i>-What do you put in?</i>
<i>-There are many famous recipes.</i>

404
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,828

<i>-Chicken hot pot?</i>

405

406

<i>-Not-hot hot pot?</i>

407
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:11,839
<i>-I've never heard of a "Not-hot hot pot."</i>
<i>-Never run out of gas on your cooker?</i>

408
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,217
<i>-Which is the most popular?</i>
<i>-In most households, chicken...</i>

409
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,761
Itokoi really is funny.

410
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,575
"You know, when it comes to food,

411
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:26,580
people can be quite fussy."

412
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,167
"Of course, we all have different tastes."

413
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,170
"You and I,

414
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,673
we're quite fussy."

415
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,926

"For example,

417
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,764
when I order a juicy steak,

418
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,933
you order dry sardines.

419
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,977
When I order a premium eel,

420
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,897
you order a pickled plum."

421
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,524
"You sure dine well."

422
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,861

"Of course I don't.
I mean what's inside."

Why are you late?

435
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,608
You called me out of the blue.
Stop complaining.

436
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,905
Let's go.

437
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,870
I need to wash my hands.

438
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,413
Why now?

439
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,920
-This is cold.
-Where'd you get that fashion sense?

440
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,923
I was just chilling at home.

441
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,926
My hands are wet.

442
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,679
I need to piss.

443
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,264
Do it at home!

444
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,099
I need to go now.

445
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,394
Asshole.

446
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,320
Asshole.

447
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,906
-Hey, you, pull over.
-Damn, it's a motorcycle cop.

448
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,701
-Quit doing Guess-Which-Hand.
-I'm not doing that.

449
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,828
What's illegal about it anyway?

450
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,831
-Guess which hands holds amphetamines.
-You're scary.

451
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,958
The cop says something.
Come on.

452
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,383
-Hey, you, pull over.
-Damn, it's a motorcycle cop.

453
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,926
Come to a stop!

454
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,513
Say something!

455
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,931
You're too fast.

456
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,933
The whole time.

457
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,478
-I gave it a nice tempo.
-And stop scratching your dick.

458
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,439
-What's with that?
-It was in the wrong place.

459
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,442
And listen to my words
before you respond.

460
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,988
We've done this act
so many times, I can't.

461
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,824
Stop that!

462
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,367
Dumbass.

463
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,926
I know it's important we practice,
but I have plans, too.

464
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,928
Say so before you come!

465
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,949
I'm going to the toilet.

466
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,795
I can't take it anymore.

467
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,222
I think I'm going to punch him.

468
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,018
<i>If you punch him, you'll break up.</i>
<i>No punching.</i>

469
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,397
But, I mean...

470
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,691
He's so annoying.

471
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,986
<i>When your practice is done,</i>
<i>come over.</i>

472
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,947
<i>Let's have dinner.</i>

473
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,118
<i>What's your favorite food?</i>

474
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,874
Korean style BBQ.

475
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,584
Wrong.

476
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,461
Tell me.

477
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,464
What is your favorite food?

478
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,846
I'm asking you:

479
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,225
What is your favorite food?

480
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,854
Today is a special day, right?

481
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,781
I like hot pots.

482
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,909
Hot pots?

483
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,911
Yes, hot pots.

484
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,378
You eat hot pots?

485
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,381
You must have strong teeth.

486
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,926
That's not what I mean.

487
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,680
Which are easier to chew?

488
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,058
Steel hot pots,
or ceramic hot pots?

489
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,814
I eat hot pots,
but I don't mean the hot pot itself.

490
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,983
You said you eat hot pots.

491
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,614
No, I mean...

492
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,824
Um...

493
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,410
I eat what goes inside the hot pots.

494
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,081
You mean "hot pot cuisine"?

495
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,374
Correct.

496
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,795
Okay, I'll buy some cow beef.

497
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,256
All beef comes from cows!
You are silly.

498
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,259
That act is hard.

499
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,344
It sure is.

500
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,704
I need to make three apologies.

501
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,085
The first is:

502
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,799
Sorry for implying I have
better things to do than practice.

503
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,432
The second is:

504
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,811
Sorry for dissing the act,
even though I never write.

505
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,907
The third is:

506
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,206
The third is:

507
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,802
The third...

508
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,762
What is it?

509
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,931
What was it?

510
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,652
What was the third one?

511
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,120
What was that third one?

512
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,257
HYUGA AGENCY

513
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,634

Perfect timing.
Let me introduce you.

They've just signed up with us.
They are Buu...

518
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,233
-I'm Buu Fubuubu's Yuki.
-I'm Kunitsu.

519
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,651
They are.

520

We really like your <i>manzai</i>.
We see you all the time.

523
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,286
Really?
Which act do you like?

524
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,830
The one where you
produce a funeral.

525
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,874
-We love that one.
-Yes.

526
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,501
We would appreciate
your advice.

527
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,336
-No problem.
-Really?

528
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,882
If you have the time...

529
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,177
It's on tonight.

530
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,637
-Ahondara will play, too.
-They will.

531
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,849
Mr. Tokunaga, I hear you're close
with Mr. Kamiya.

532
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,975
Well, yeah.

533
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,020
-It's an honor to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.

534
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,563
The pleasure's ours.

535
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,857
We must head to the theater now.

536
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,525
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

537
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,781
We look forward
to working with you.

538
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,032
-Good luck.
-Yessir!

539
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,910
-Let's do our best!
-I'll call you if something pops up.

540
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,536
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

541
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,540
-Go get 'em tonight.
-We shall!

542
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,584
-I can't make it.
-You can't?

543
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,127
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

544
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,879
-Bye, guys.
-See ya.

545
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,886
They're already planning to do
a solo show with us.

546
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,264
They move fast.
That's what you call experience.

547
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,018
Now I'm in charge of comedians, too.

548
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,480
Our agency's putting
more focus on comedy.

549
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,898
You are?

550
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,609
I saw you on TV.

551
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,736
Tokunaga's scenes got cut.

552
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:42,862
Sorry.

553
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,573
Yamashita did good enough
for you both.

554
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,533
Thank you.

555
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,162
Yamashita, you won the part
you auditioned for the other day.

556
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,581
-I just got the call.
-Really?

557
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,791
What audition?

558
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,918
He didn't tell you?

559
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,920
No.

560
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,799
That director the other day
liked Yamashita.

561
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,426
He'll do a pretty big film soon.

562
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,894
Why didn't you tell me?

563
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,898
It's not a job as a comedian.

564
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,863
Had you already had the audition
when we last practiced?

565
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,785
I feel like an idiot.

566
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,164
Exposure as an actor
will give us more work.

567
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,918
Hey.

568
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,921
Didn't you give your soul to <i>manzai?</i>

569
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,506
Huh?

570
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,508
Isn't practice important?!

571
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,467
It is.

572
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,927
Have you no faith?

573
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,890
Can you guarantee we'll hit the big time?

574
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,975
This is a chance, too!

575
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,894
And...

576
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:01,024
since we're taking so long to make it big,
Yurie's dad is stressing us out.

577
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,114
Do whatever you want.

578
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,404
Will your dad be okay?

579
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,867
Well, he's still alive.

580
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,497
But he won't make a full recovery.

581
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,876
They said he probably won't work again.

582
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,881
Mr. Tokunaga...

583
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,634
I owe you a lot.

584
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,886
Not at all.

585
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,891
Thanks.

586
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,434
Here'll do.

587
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,061
No, I'll see you off.

588
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,771
It's okay.

589
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,608
The bus won't leave for a while.

590
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,610
But...

591
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,865
It's kinda tough to be seen off.

592
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,076
So, here'll do.

593
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:36,869
Thanks.

594
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,085
I think...

595
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:51,009
I hope you continue playing music
back home.

596
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:58,516
I mean, as long as there's a street,
you can do a show.

597
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,479
We have streets back home...

598
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,316
but there's no people.

599
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,033
We have lots of cows.

600
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,952
And...

601
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,495
chickens.

602
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,090
Can I ask you a favor?

603
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,890
Could you sing
one last song for me?

604
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,444
<i>Let's whistle as we walk</i>

605
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,989
<i>Dear friend</i>
<i>You look like you're feeling down</i>

606
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,619
<i>We all go through hard times</i>

607
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:45,164
<i>But the stars are shining high in the sky</i>

608
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,836
<i>Do you remember that old park?</i>

609
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,880
<i>Why don't we go there?</i>

610
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,885
<i>We might remember something</i>

611
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,305
<i>Something we've been forgetting recently</i>

612
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,685
<i>What did we have back then?</i>

613
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:09,313
<i>We had no responsibilities</i>

614
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,401
<i>We were overflowing with dreams</i>

615
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:18,156
<i>We had so much time</i>
<i>On our hands</i>

616
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,492
<i>Let's whistle as we walk</i>

617
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:25,121
<i>Dear me</i>
<i>You look like you're feeling down</i>

618
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,750
<i>I hear a guitar playing in the distance</i>

619
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,045
<i>It's slowly rising into the sky</i>

620
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:38,926
<i>At the bottom of my heart</i>

621
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,556
<i>They are still making noise</i>

622
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,350
<i>Those feelings inside</i>

623
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:51,731
<i>Nothing inside has changed</i>

624
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,385
<i>Here we are today</i>

625
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,264
<i>We bow to people</i>

626
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,602
<i>We put on a smile</i>

627
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,482
<i>As we shed invisible tears</i>

628
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,069
<i>Let's whistle as we walk</i>

629
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,489
<i>Dear friend</i>
<i>You look like you're feeling down</i>

630
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,993
<i>I guess there's nobody to blame</i>

631
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,747
<i>That's just the way it is</i>

632
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,085
<i>Let's whistle as we walk</i>

633
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,089
<i>The stars are shining high in the sky</i>

634
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,750
-One ticket, please.
-Two-thousand yen... Huh?

635
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,419
Mr. Tokunaga, from Sparks?

636
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,838
-Go in. It's started.
-Take it.

637
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,426
-Mr. Tokunaga!
-You came.

638
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,969
Thank you.

639
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,429
We're on next.

640
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,848
And take us to dinner sometime!

641
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:01,902
-It was once inhabited by Vikings.
-"No way."

642
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,157
-It has a long, rich history of skiing.
-"No way."

643
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,827
-Its fjords truly are beautiful.
-"No way."

644
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:14,081
You're talking about Norway!
That makes more sense.

645
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:18,586
-Yeah. I told you to say, "Norway."
-I thought you said, "No way."

646
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,880
-Next up--
-There's more?

647
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,590
Answer every question with:

648
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,760
-"Sweet and sour pork."
-Why am I doing this?

649
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,220
-Are you ready to order?
-"Sweet and sour pork."

650
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,639
-Would you like dessert?
-"Sweet and sour pork."

651
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,892
-We're closing soon.
-"Sweet and sour pork."

652
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,936
-We'll run out of pork!
-It's your fault!

653
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,522
-You like it that much?
-I do, actually!

654
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,358
-Next up--
-Why strip that off now?

655
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,863
-Answer everything with "Clap your hands."
-I don't want to.

656
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,783
-If you're happy and you know it?
-"Clap your hands."

657
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,494
<i>-If you're happy and you know it?</i>
<i>-"Clap your hands."</i>

658
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:56,248
<i>-If you're happy and you know it?</i>
<i>-"Then you really ought to show it..."</i>
