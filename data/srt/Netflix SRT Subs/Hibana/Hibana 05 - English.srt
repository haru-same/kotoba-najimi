00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,418
-Good evening.
-Hello.

2
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,587
Thank you.

3
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,590
-Good evening.
-Hello.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,512
-Good evening.
-Hello.

5
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,807
"...and rattle your teeth."

6
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,767
Hi.

7
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,060
Hi there.

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,105
-I'll give you a hand.
-We can carry it.

9
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,940
We're almost there.

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,276
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,616
"Scary?"
"No."

12
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,159
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

13
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,580
"I know some threats
that will make even you tremble."

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,872
Good evening.

15
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,958
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,505
Good evening.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,094
Hi.

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,807
Hello.

19
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,937
-Good evening.
-Hi.

20
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,026
Hi.

21
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,328
Good evening.
I hope it's a great show.

22
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,005
"THE SHIBUYA ALL-STAR FESTIVAL"
Doors 18:30, Starts 19:00

23
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,759
19:35 - Sparks, 19:39 - Ahondara,
19:43 - The Curl, 19:47 - Shikatani

24
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,886
How may I help you?

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,472
How may I help you?!

26
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,973
Good evening!

27
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,975
So, we're together tonight.

28
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,019
Yep.

29
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,107
You, me, and everyone else
here tonight are stars.

30
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,538
Good evening.

31
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,208
-Got any spare cash?
-Not really...

32
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,210
-You don't?
-Don't ask her for a loan.

33
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,003
-You're a big brother!
-Please!

34
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,131
Why do you need two tickets?
No way!

35
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,593
Your dad's here? You didn't tell me!

36
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,471
We're all stars.

37
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,889
Just make up an excuse.

38
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,020
What do you think about
the "audience vote" system?

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,943
I think it's valid,
apart from votes from family members.

40
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:19,491
But doesn't that give an advantage
to duos who bring more people?

41
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,997
The popular duos may have fans,
but everyone starts out as a nobody.

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,917
If you turn strangers into fans,
you'll be popular.

43
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,419
You're right.

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,173
Let's say
you're a fan of a certain duo.

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,676
If they have a bad day,
and you vote honestly,

46
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,554
your favorite duo may get demoted.
What happens next?

47
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,974
You might never see them again.

48
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:51,064
But I still think we deserve
a fair evaluation of each act--

49
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,071
You're not talking like a star.

50
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,826
Don't complain about
who votes for who.

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,328
Make them vote for you.
That's talent.

52
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,749
Watch. You'll see.

53
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,422
Ohbayashi.

54
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,091
I'm changing the act.

55
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,178
You're changing it?

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,433
I'll say some funny stuff.
All you have to do is react normally.

57
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,226
Why change it?

58
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,940
God spoke to me.

59
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,610
I'm gonna kill you.

60
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,446
What's the problem?
You can do it.

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,948
Again?

62
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,955
Gimme a break.

63
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,936
Mr. Tokunaga?

64
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,941
I really like you.
My name is Shikatani.

65
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:18,944
What?

66
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,904
I'm Shikatani.

67
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,658
I'm Shikatani.

68
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,409
Okay.

69
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,539
You should join the Shikatani Army
as chief strategist.

70
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,790
Let's conquer the world.

71
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,001
What?

72
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,088
I'll let you think about it.

73
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,486
What was that?

74
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,737
Join 'em.

75
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,950
Join the Shikatani Army?

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,953
-You'll be chief strategist.
-Are you serious?

77
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,039
That was scary.

78
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:22,841
HIBANA
- Spark -

79
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,361
What's with that face?
Her dad's not gonna laugh.

80
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,947
His face is totally laughless.
He's a crocodile.

81
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,907
Think of them as two extra votes.

82
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,910
His eyes are like a crocodile
about to feast.

83
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:51,870
A crocodile...

84
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,456
THE SHIBUYA ALL-STAR FESTIVAL

85
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,584
-Hello!
-Hello!

86
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,879
Welcome to
The Shibuya All-Star Festival.

87
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,965
We're your hosts, Bach 3000.
Please enjoy the show!

88
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,259
It's started.

89
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,510
It's on.

90
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,265
Got any spare cash?

91
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,310
-Just a bit.
-You know I'm in a tight spot.

92
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,979
Don't ask big brothers for money.

93
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,984
-Until payday.
-Thanks.

94
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,071
-...enjoy five acts in a row!
-Go for it!

95
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,169
-Hello!
-Hello!

96
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,880
We are Cheery Shower.
Please enjoy the show.

97
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,132
-Applause please!
-Thank you!

98
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,053
<i>-What an audience!</i>
<i>-I need your advice.</i>

99
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,848
I have a problem telling people off
when they do something wrong.

100
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,393
What kind of man are you?

101
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,269
What'll happen if you have a kid?

102
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,855
-It'll become a teeny-weeny dump-bump.
-What?!

103
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,900
-"Teeny-weeny dump-bump"?
-I know how to discipline.

104
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,027
We have a big mouth.

105
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,821
You're too far away.
Come here.

106
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
You're in the lion's cage!

107
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,034
Ouch!

108
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,662
-How did that feel?
-I'm no wildlife expert!

109
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,747
-Bad answer!
-Why?!

110
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,749
-Watch and learn.
-Look at my T-shirt.

111
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,711
-This is how you do it.
-Don't strip it off.

112
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,212
Come on, lion!

113
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,310
Obuchi?

114
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,105
Hey!
Are you listening?

115
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,940
Obuchi?!

116
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,942
He's gone!

117
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,445
Why?!
Where'd he go?!

118
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,823
What is this?
What's happened?

119
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,783
He's there!

120
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,119
Let's learn Zimbabwean.

121
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,834
Be careful with the pronunciation
at the end.

122
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,215
"There's an egg on my heel."

123
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,928
If you need a new lightbulb,
would you say this?

124
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,849
"My fluorescent light
is winking at me."

125
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,893
-Would you say that?
-No.

126
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,853
You'd say,
"Shit. The light's dead."

127
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,938
-That's how we speak.
-You're right.

128
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,609
It pisses me off how guys are deceived
by girls that speak like that.

129
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,903
-Feel better?
-Not at all.

130
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,821
-I've had enough. Thank you.
-Thank you.

131
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,120
<i>That's the end of the first half.</i>

132
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,916
<i>-"There's an egg on my heel."</i>
<i>-That's not very useful.</i>

133
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>-That's all the Zimbabwean I need to know.</i>
<i>-I doubt you'll ever use it.</i>

134
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,379
<i>Let's get on with the show.</i>

135
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,924
<i>We have five more acts</i>
<i>coming your way!</i>

136
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,051
<i>First up is Sparks!</i>

137
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,054
<i>Followed by Ahondara!</i>

138
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,474
-Does that spell work on father-in-laws?
-Don't remind me.

139
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,060
-You're scaring me.
-You want a lick?

140
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,228
No.

141
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,271
Try it.

142
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,233
-Lick it.
-No way!

143
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,029
You sure?
You won't regret it.

144
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,781
Enough already.

145
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,451
-Hello!
-Hello!

146
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,745
We're Sparks.
Please enjoy the show.

147
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,793
-He stood on the wrong side.
-Don't tell everyone.

148
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,379
-Is this really happening?
-I'm in top form.

149
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,089
-Top form?
-Top form.

150
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,924
Please enjoy the show.

151
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,885
Another round of applause.
Thank you.

152
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,888
-Debates are fun.
-Yeah.

153
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,976
There are certain topics that
everyone's had a fun debate about.

154
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,103
-Like what?
-For example:

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,898
-"What to take to a deserted island."
-That's a fun one.

156
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,944
-"What to eat for your very last meal."
-Japanese food or Western food, right?

157
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,905
Another one is how to make
the following threat scarier:

158
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,117
"I'll stick my fingers up your ass
and rattle your teeth."

159
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,661
And when you have a cigar...

160
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,788
Forget about the cigar.

161
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,374
We have a problem
with the third example.

162
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,085
"I'll stick my fingers up your ass
and rattle your teeth"?

163
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,671
Nobody's ever debated
how to make that threat scarier!

164
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,590
None of us.
Just you.

165
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,425
Nobody has.

166
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,759
-You haven't?
-No.

167
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,762
-You haven't?
-Of course they haven't.

168
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,932
-I didn't expect this reaction.
-What did you expect?!

169
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,311
-Okay, perfect. Let's think about it now.
-What?

170
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,314
"I'll stick my fingers up your ass
and rattle your teeth."

171
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,151
-Is that threat even scary?
-I guess so. If someone said that to me.

172
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,485
Hey, asshole!

173
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,073
I'll stick my fingers up your ass
and rattle your teeth!

174
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,327
It's not that scary.

175
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,746
-It's not.
-I'm a grown-up.

176
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,166
But I know some threats
that will make even you tremble.

177
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,668
You'll make me tremble?
I doubt it.

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,629
-Wanna hear one?
-If you know one.

179
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,341
-Hey, asshole!
-What, asshole?

180
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,884
-Asshole!
-What?

181
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,346
I'm gonna stick my fingers
so far up your ass, I'll tremble!

182
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,680
<i>You</i> will tremble?

183
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,349
<i>You're</i> gonna tremble?

184
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,976
<i>You'll stick your fingers in me,</i>
<i>and you'll tremble?</i>

185
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,895
<i>That's not a threat.</i>

186
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,985
-I'm focusing on your ass too much.
-What are you talking about?

187
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,571
-Can I forget about asses?
-Yes. You're a grown-up.

188
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,867
Can I try a threat that comes
from deep down inside of me?

189
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,535
If it's scary, sure.

190
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,954
Here goes.

191
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,247
Hey!

192
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,875
Don't point at the audience.

193
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,378
-I'm talking to you.
-I'm sorry, sir.

194
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,463
I wanna go bowling with you.

195
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,590
When you throw,
I'll diss you so much,

196
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,925
you'll be gutted!

197
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,345
Do you mean "gutted" or "guttered"?
One means "devastated" and the other--

198
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,348
-Why are you talking?
-They can talk if they want.

199
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,309
-I can hear you!
-Really? You have good ears.

200
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,394
Stop it.

201
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,438
I'll turn up your heater
and give you dry skin!

202
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,566
Are you every girl's worst nightmare?
She uses a moisturizer.

203
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,945
-And what's with you?!
-Leave the sound engineer alone.

204
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,698
-You hear me?
-He hears you the most!

205
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,199
He's the sound guy!

206
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,201
-Damn you.
-What's wrong with you?!

207
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,953
Stop it.

208
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,582
I'll take you to a doctor fish spa
and have your dead skin eaten!

209
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,919
Take her!
She's the one with dry skin!

210
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,629
Take her.

211
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,881
What?

212
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,885
Wanna go where space and time bend,
and the concept of life no longer exists?

213
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,888
Stop it! That's scary!
She'll never come again!

214
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:26,931
Stop beckoning her.

215
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,058
If she agreed to come,
she'd be the scary one.

216
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,935
"I'd love to go"?
That'd be scary!

217
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,895
What?

218
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,691
"I'm gonna fill our pockets with dreams
and take us to the top."

219
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,276
"Stay tuned."
How lame!

220
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,279
That's not even a threat.
What's with you?

221
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,990
Your threats suck.
This is how you make a threat:

222
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,034
I'll slap me, you... Oops.

223
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,118
What?!

224
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,411
-I mean...
-What?!

225
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,623
<i>I'll slap you with the back of my hand</i>
<i>and say, "I've had enough!"</i>

226
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,878
<i>You stuffed up the last line?!</i>
<i>I'll "gutter" you later. I've had enough.</i>

227
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,296
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

228
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,471
-You stuffed up the last line?!
-Sorry.

229
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,723
-And it was too fast!
-I'm sorry.

230
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,854
Hello!

231
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,567
-Hi. We're Ahondara. Enjoy the show.
-Howdy.

232
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,945
I know you stole money from my wallet.

233
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,824
-No, I didn't. What's this?
-You sound nervous. So you are guilty.

234
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,035
I'm not nervous at all.

235
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,497
-You did it?
-No, I didn't. Cut it out.

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,748
-Really?
-What?

237
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,419
Then from now on, I want you to answer
every question I ask with the word, "No."

238
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,047
Like a lie detector?
Gimme a break.

239
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,885
-Answer every question with the word "No."
-Fine. Hurry up and ask!

240
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,680
-Do you have financial problems?
-"No."

241
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,476
What's with the face?

242
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,437
Do you drool when you see
the guy on the 10,000 yen note?

243
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,147
"No."

244
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,237
Is stealing just like breathing?

245
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,072
"No."
Your questions piss me off.

246
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,534
-I'm seeing things clearer now.
-How did those questions help?

247
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,912
Now I want you to respond to
each statement with "No way."

248
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,622
Whatever.
Spit it out.

249
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,167
-It was once inhabited by Vikings.
-"No way."

250
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,587
-It has a long, rich history of skiing.
-"No way."

251
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,966
-Its fjords are extremely beautiful.
-"No way."

252
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,801
You mean "Norway"!

253
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,847
Not "No way."
Vikings, skis and fjords?

254
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,434
Don't wave at the audience.
Are you some kind of politician?

255
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,187
-I told you to say, "Norway."
-Why? I still don't get it.

256
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,899
Next, I want you to respond to
each statement with a "Yahoooo!"

257
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,943
Why? That's embarrassing.

258
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,279
My friend's sick in hospital.

259
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,949
Today is my grandpa's funeral.

260
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,243
Look!
A puppy got run over!

261
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,912
-You're cruel.
-You made me say it!

262
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,205
It's your fault!

263
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,918
Wow.

264
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,171
Now I want you to respond
with this sound:

265
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,381
Got it?

266
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,759
What's with that?
That's really embarrassing.

267
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,763
-Okay?
-What is this? I don't get it.

268
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,141
What's it like in a 42°C bath?

269
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,063
What's it like in a 15°C bath?

270
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,944
What's it like in a 14°C bath?

271
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,243
What's it like in a -1°C bath?

272
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
Why make me do this?!

273
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,167
How embarrassing.
I don't want to make that sound.

274
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,336
-Next up--
-There's more?!

275
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,922
Respond with <i>"Papapappepo."</i>

276
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,048
What?

277
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,925
Respond with <i>"Papapappepo."</i>

278
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,885
It's not even Japanese.

279
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,762
Do you have financial problems?

280
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,846
<i>"Papapappepo."</i>

281
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,598
Your home planet is?

282
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>"Papapappepo."</i>

283
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,850
<i>Morastinperogatta?</i>

284
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>"Papapappepo!"</i>

285
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,270
-What did you say?
-What did you say?! Cut it out!

286
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,649
What is this?!

287
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,569
Why make me say that
in front of all these people?

288
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,743
-It had nothing to do with your money.
-Actually, it made everything clear.

289
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,411
You...

290
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,788
didn't do it.

291
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:19,997
I'm off the hook!

292
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,166
I've had enough.
Thank you.

293
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,443
You bought a Zippo?

294
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,664
Hello!

295
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,583
I MAKE EVERYTHING COOL

296
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,919
Hello. I'm Shikatani.
Please enjoy the show.

297
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,713
Thank you.

298
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,507
You're such a warm crowd.

299
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,886
Today I'm going to show you
how I make things cool.

300
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,347
Eyes this way, please.
The first is:

301
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,267
"¥600 per hour."
That's an uncool job.

302
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,437
It's less than the minimum wage.
Very uncool.

303
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,647
I'll make it cooler.

304
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,818
"Donate the income from a ¥600/hour job
to unfortunate children!"

305
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,153
That's cool!

306
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,529
This is really cool.

307
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:38,784
It's like they're poor, but they help out,
like Mother Teresa, right?

308
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,328
It's really cool.

309
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,787
Next up:

310
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,456
Hang on.

311
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,875
It's stuck to the next page.

312
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,670
Who would've thought this would happen?
Just a moment.

313
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,298
This is...
Okay.

314
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,550
"Snoring."
It's uncool, right?

315
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,926
You didn't see the next one.

316
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,553
Ready for "Snoring"?

317
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,847
"Snore like Beckham."

318
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,266
If you snored with a mini mohawk,
that'd be cool.

319
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,101
This is cool.
Next is:

320
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,978
"Zucchini."

321
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,065
Most people think
zucchinis are funny vegetables.

322
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,359
But I'll make them cool.
Here goes.

323
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,195
What is it?

324
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,905
First batter:

325
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,282
Fielding right, Ichiro.

326
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,910
Second batter:

327
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,037
Fielding left, Taguchi.

328
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,790
Third batter:

329
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,917
Fielding center, Matsui.

330
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,795
Fourth batter:

331
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,756
I can't peel it off.
Sorry.

332
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,925
This is the punchline.

333
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,678
Why won't it come off?

334
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,931
The glue is too strong.

335
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,642
Just a moment, please.

336
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,938
It says, "Fourth batter:
Fielding third, Zucchini."

337
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,941
Why can't I peel it off?

338
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,610
This is wrong!

339
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,863
Who did that?!

340
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,324
Who the heck did that?!

341
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,537
Please don't look!

342
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>Why can't I peel it off?</i>

343
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,879
I spent two hours making this!

344
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,593
My little sister helped me!

345
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,141
My sister helped,
but I did all the glue.

346
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,268
It's all my fault!

347
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,645
Damn!

348
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,939
Thank you!

349
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,950
And the winner is...

350
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,119
Shikatani!

351
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,496
Congratulations!

352
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,331
Congratulations, Shikatani!

353
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,750
Why me?!

354
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,836
Why do I win?!

355
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,047
You got the most laughs.
Congratulations!

356
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,467
This is wrong!

357
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,761
Why do I win?!

358
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,429
They all voted for you.

359
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,931
That wasn't comedy!

360
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,892
But you're the winner.

361
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,228
When I go backstage,
the others will hate me!

362
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,733
See?

363
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,862
I told you to watch, right?

364
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,071
Sorry?

365
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:26,118
The god of comedy doesn't care
how perfect your act is.

366
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,914
That wasn't what comedy is about!

367
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,042
Why complain?
Everyone was laughing.

368
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:34,877
You're right.

369
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,754
And your little sister's here.

370
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,340
-Here she is.
-Really?

371
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,925
She's my doppelgänger!

372
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,910
My legs were aching yesterday.

373
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,288
I was so tired.
It was the first time in ages.

374
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,916
-More meat?
-Go for it.

375
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,922
We're on our way.
Bye.

376
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,134
What are you doing?

377
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,930
-Hurry up.
-I can't climb any further.

378
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,933
Come on.
Give it to me.

379
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,478
Pull yourself together.
You guys were the funniest.

380
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,482
Don't lie. We came in sixth.
How can sixth be the funniest?

381
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,609
Forget about the ranking!

382
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,154
You know what?
The audience was full of idiots.

383
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,866
-Let's eat something nice.
-I couldn't eat a thing.

384
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,785
Dad's waiting for us.

385
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,621
He'll say, "You dine well
for someone that came in sixth."

386
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,623
Anyone who saw the show
would say that.

387
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,043
Enough already.
You're gonna have a nice meal.

388
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,671
-Thanks, Toku-chan.
-Take care.

389
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,673
-You coming?
-Why would I go?

390
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,093
Thanks.

391
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,888
I don't have the face
to show your father.

392
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,433
Just put on your
"I ranked sixth" face.

393
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,388
CALL US NOW
FOR RELIABLE LEGAL ADVICE

394
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,061
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

395
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,527
-Cheers!
-Congratulations!

396
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,585
YOU'VE GOT MAIL
FROM: TOKUNAGA

397
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,878
TITLE: THANK YOU

398
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,674
THE FIRST THING YOU SAID TO ME
TODAY WAS, "HOW MAY I HELP YOU?"

399
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,888
I APPRECIATE THAT WAS YOUR
UNIQUE WAY OF MAKING A JOKE.

400
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,099
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR REPLYING SO NORMALLY.

401
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,351
CHANTING SUTRAS
TO PACHELBEL'S CANON

402
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,187
IF YOU REALLY FELT SORRY,

403
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,940
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICER
TO LET ME FORGET HOW I BOMBED.

404
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:47,194
I COULD LIVE WITH MYSELF,
CONVINCED YOU SIMPLY HADN'T HEARD.

405
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,073
A THREE-TATAMI MAT ROOM
JAM-PACKED WITH MESSIAHS

406
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,931
Shikatani...

407
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,928
TO BE HONEST, I CHANGED OUR ROUTINE
TO IMPRESS YOU.

408
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,264
BUT WE DIDN'T WIN,
SO IT WAS POINTLESS.

409
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,724
WE'LL WIN NEXT TIME.

410
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,350
A BODYSLAM FROM MOTHER TERESA

411
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,906
AHONDARA WAS FUNNY.

412
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,909
A SEWER THAT LOOKS
JUST LIKE HIS GIRLFRIEND

413
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,913
I WAS WONDERING IF ONE OF THE GREATEST
PEOPLE IN HISTORY WOULD END UP 4TH.

414
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,583
WELL, I SHOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU,
SINCE YOU FINISHED 10TH AND ALL.

415
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,585
EDISON INVENTED DARKNESS

416
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,970
SIXTH.
WE CAME IN SIXTH.

417
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,265
EDISON ACTUALLY INVENTED
DARK BASEMENTS

418
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,482
I'll put on some treatment
and you'll be done.

419
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,125
What do you think?

420
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,252
What should I say?

421
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,839
-Does your scalp still hurt?
-It's better now.

422
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,928
I always wanted to give
someone silver hair.

423
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,721
It set in well.

424
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,061
Hang on.
Don't move.

425
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,274
That's it.
Okay!

426
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,905
I'm sorry.
You don't like it?

427
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,115
No...
It's great.

428
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,078
Thanks.

429
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,872
Tokunaga...

430
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,166
Your smile is creepy.

431
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,752
What's with that?

432
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,420
Done!

433
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,756
You were great.

434
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,719
I knew this bit
wouldn't dye properly.

435
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,930
How disappointing!

436
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,776
SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES

437
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,171
Hello.

438
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,139
Hello, Mr. Ogata.

439
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,309
I've come about some expenses...

440
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,357
Tokunaga...

441
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,695
Sorry, it's...

442
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,532
That's...

443
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,077
It's just what we've been waiting for!

444
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,164
This business isn't about
talent anymore.

445
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,374
A persona.
That's what you need.

446
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,044
It's all about persona.

447
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,510
You like this?

448
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,596
It's good?

449
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,639
This is what's hot?

450
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,558
Maybe not "hot"...

451
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,655
This way.

452
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,536
"The Artistic Comedian."

453
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,873
I think it'll work.

454
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,632
It's good.
Really good.

455
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,300
He's coming.

456
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,844
-He's on a roll.
-He sure is.

457
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,513
It finally hit him.

458
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,139
You think so?

459
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,938
You're bored already?

460
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,819
About the expenses...

461
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,241
THE ARTISTIC COMEDIAN

462
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,457
Hello.

463
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,503
Thanks, as always.

464
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,768
So, let's go.

465
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,581
-Thanks.
-Come again soon.

466
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,001
Thanks for the meal.

467
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,669
It was nothing.

468
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,963
Maki paid for it.

469
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,314
-Thanks for this, too.
-It's nothing.

470
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,524
Maki's paying for it.

471
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,985
That takes the fun out of it.

472
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,826
Ready?
Go!

473
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,994
Okay!

474
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,996
One more!

475
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,831
Okay!

476
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,794
Concentrate!

477
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,671
Keep your eyes on the ball.

478
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,008
Ready?

479
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,344
Watch the ball.

480
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,846
Yours is faster.

481
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,018
-This is gonna hurt if it hits.
-I keep missing.

482
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,986
It's all about concentration.
Watch the ball.

483
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,032
Concentrate, okay?
Concentrate.

484
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,992
Where's your waist?

485
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,285
Okay.

486
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,081
It got me!

487
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,417
That's better.

488
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,003
Concentrate!

489
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,757
The ball's coming.
Concentrate.

490
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,344
That was way off.

491
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,013
It's too high.
I can't reach.

492
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,641
-Give it a boner.
-A boner sounds scary.

493
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,686
You'll be out at first.

494
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,313
You wanna be a regular?

495
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,023
You wanna win?!

496
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,025
Gonna be on the team?!

497
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,362
Way to go!

498
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,287
I've got some change.

499
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,705
I don't need any.

500
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,128
Counting your coins
won't make them increase.

501
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,630
If I let you pay 10 yen here,

502
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,967
it'll be like we've always
split the bill.

503
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,975
I'd actually like a bottle of tea,
which means you need another 40 yen...

504
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,061
You've got a mean streak.
Fine.

505
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,236
I'm pushing it.

506
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,995
So?

507
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,164
Sorry?

508
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:28,335
-What's with that hair?
-You finally made a comment.

509
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,005
-You still hung up about ranking 10th?
-We were 6th!

510
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,217
Well, you see...

511
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,803
My hairdresser friend
asked me a favor.

512
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,016
You think it's too much?

513
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,562
It might look like
you're being original.

514
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,523
But if somebody else out there
looks the same,

515
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,860
then it's not originality.
It's just an imitation.

516
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,239
Are there other people
who look like this?

517
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,578
If every up-and-coming hairdresser
needs practice with silver dye, yeah.

518
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,830
That's a possibility.

519
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,041
The thing is...

520
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,338
when people make rules about
how they should look and act,

521
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,799
they end up impersonating themselves.

522
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,677
That's why I disagree with
the idea of creating a persona.

523
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,724
I don't really have any rules, but...

524
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:27,977
For example...

525
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,981
I like corduroy pants.

526
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:36,111
But there's one type I don't like:
Beige corduroy pants.

527
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,487
Why?

528
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,825
Corduroy pants have vertical lines, right?

529
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,287
But beige is an expansive color.
I think those concepts clash.

530
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,457
In my opinion,
when guys wear beige corduroy pants,

531
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,670
it means they want to wear corduroy pants,
but they're completely messed up.

532
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,255
Stop being so fussy.

533
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,006
Your monologue started off smoothly,

534
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,592
but it had nothing to do with my story.

535
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,809
About what I was just saying...

536
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,104
-What?
-About beige corduroy pants...

537
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,691
-There's another reason I hate them.
-There is?

538
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:22,198
When I was in junior high, our Classic
Literature teacher wore corduroy pants.

539
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,785
Everyone made fun of him.
His pants weren't cool.

540
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,663
That makes sense.

541
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,917
Statistics say that most students make fun
of their Classic Literature teacher.

542
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,419
They do.

543
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,130
The thing is...

544
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,049
As far as I was concerned,

545
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,886
there wasn't anything uncool
about those corduroy pants.

546
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:49,100
So I went to a used-clothing shop
and bought my own navy corduroy pants.

547
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,019
After that,
I wore them all the time.

548
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:55,815
But then in senior high,
second-hand Levi's became popular.

549
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,776
Everyone stopped making fun of me,

550
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,862
and they started to wear
corduroy pants themselves.

551
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,155
To make it worse,

552
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,158
they all wore beige corduroy pants.

553
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,578
It all felt so wrong.

554
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,751
Imagine a punk, with a Mohican,
wearing a jacket made of cotton.

555
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,879
-That's how wrong it felt--
-Why don't you hit the ball?

556
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,052
I felt so pathetic.

557
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,806
But to be honest,

558
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,810
when you think about beige corduroy pants,
as far as beige corduroy pants go, they--

559
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,228
I've had enough!

560
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,856
I've had enough
of your beige corduroy pants.

561
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,902
You enjoyed saying the phrase
"beige corduroy pants" more than anything.

562
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,695
Sorry.

563
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,493
Let's go to my place.
Maki should be home soon.

564
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,289
Watch out!

565
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,875
Keep your eyes on the ball.

566
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,752
It's dangerous.

567
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,213
It's too fast.
I can't hit any of them.

568
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,091
It's harder than it looks.

569
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,013
Why didn't we swing our bats
the first round?

570
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,683
It's dangerous to talk too much.

571
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,561
The Drum-Drum Man.

572
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,063
-The Bright-Red-Hat Man.
-The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

573
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,941
-Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!
-Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!

574
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,610
-The Drum-Drum Man.
-The Drum-Drum Man.

575
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,320
-The Drum-Drum Man.
-The Drum-Drum Man.

576
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,783
-Sorry, boys.
-Watch out, old man!

577
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,287
-You should switch your light on.
-Leave him alone.

578
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,585
Old man! Your light!

579
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,884
The Light-Light Man.

580
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,386
The Light-Light Man.

581
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,222
The Little-Bit-Bald Old Man.

582
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,100
Switch your light on.
Hurry up, switch it on!

583
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,715
Today's cold.

584
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,675
-Welcome home.
-I'm back.

585
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,844
-Excuse me.
-Welcome.

586
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,015
Wow, Tokunaga!
I didn't recognize you!

587
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,060
-Sorry.
-Why? It really suits you.

588
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,314
-It's been a while. How have you been?
-Good, thanks.

589
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,109
When comedians start to worry,

590
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,821
they tend to become skinheads,
or dye their hair.

591
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,699
Isn't this your seat?

592
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,825
Sit down.

593
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,829
-Sorry, we always have hot pot.
-I'm sorry for the sudden intrusion.

594
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,751
Can I give you a hand?

595
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,295
No, after all, you're...

596
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,255
You know.

597
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,218
My job is to eat.

598
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,811
-Need a hand?
-Thanks.

599
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:21,980
Okay.

600
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,898
Can you handle this?

601
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,944
-I'll do it.
-You're, you know...

602
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,821
My job is to eat.

603
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,824
What's that look for?

604
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,078
What is this?

605
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,124
I wonder...

606
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,001
What is it?

607
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,929
I need to take a leak.

608
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,690
-I need to go.
-Why don't you?

609
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,067
No...

610
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,485
I need to go.

611
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,447
I get it.
If you go now, you lose.

612
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,489
I'm gone.

613
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,283
You are going?

614
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,966
What's wrong?

615
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,259
Mr. Kamiya.

616
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,429
-I didn't...
-You know what?

617
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,767
I worked at a cafe back in Osaka.

618
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:11,315
We had to wear a black apron
with the cafe's name on it.

619
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:17,113
As for pants, we could wear anything,
as long as it was beige.

620
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,826
I'm sorry.

621
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,078
No need to apologize.

622
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,289
That's all it was.

623
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,668
I just needed beige pants.

624
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,173
I've got a few that aren't corduroy.

625
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,635
I see.

626
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,807
But...

627
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,895
Looking at beige corduroy pants now,
after all these years,

628
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,730
I think they are cool.

629
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,442
Enough already.

630
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,995
Dinner's ready.
Let's eat.

631
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,837
Yep, they are cool.

632
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,302
They're yours.

633
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,095
Thank you.

634
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,026
<i>It's time for</i>
The Great Laugh Typhoon Z.

635
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,861
<i>-I'm your host, Kaneko.</i>
<i>-I'm Goro!</i>

636
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,280
<i>-And she is:</i>

<i>Tonight we also have</i>

What shall we do with the soup?
Do you want to add rice or noodles?

643
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,852
<i>Onimanma.</i>

644
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,523
<i>Onimanma</i> it is.

645
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,254
Can I have your bowl?

646
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,131
Thank you.

647
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,052
There you go.
Delicious <i>onimanma.</i>

648
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,679
Thank you.

649
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,639
Well...

650
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,767
All <i>onimanma</i> tastes the same.

651
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,896
Here's your <i>onimanma.</i>

652
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,861
Like it?

653
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,114
This <i>onimanma</i> is good.

654
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,703
It sure is.
<i>Onimanma.</i>

655
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,872
Here comes my <i>onimanma.</i>

656
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,044
Nothing beats <i>onimanma.</i>

657
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,844
I love <i>onimanma.</i>

658
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,849
<i>Onimanma</i> tastes better with ponzu sauce.

659
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,352
This is good <i>onimanma.</i>

660
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,858
You're right.
Ponzu and <i>onimanma.</i>

661
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,867
<i>Onimanma?</i>
Is that what this is called?

662
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,705
Say <i>"onimanma"</i> ten times.

663
00:47:55,748 --> 00:48:00,294
<i>Onimanma...</i>

664
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,673
There's no punchline?
