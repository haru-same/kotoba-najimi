1
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,834
I'm gonna live in Kichijoji.
Where are you?

2
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,879
An abundance of peaches

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,717
I'm in Koenji.

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,388
I'm heading to Kichijoji now.

5
00:00:54,555 --> 00:01:00,352
A sweet olive tree is crying

6
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,001
HIBANA
- Spark -

7
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,917
I saw a weird monster walking towards me.

8
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,878
But it was just you.

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,047
My thoughts exactly.

10
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,050
Please go back to Osaka.

11
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,887
I strongly, strongly, strongly
suggest you go.

12
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,581
Winter once meant the same thing
for humans and animals alike.

13
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,125
It was a matter of life or death.

14
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,505
Many living creatures died
during the winter.

15
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,842
We must have inherited a certain sense.

16
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,888
We get depressed in the fall
because we know winter's coming.

17
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,769
-Where's the "How insightful!"?
-Sorry.

18
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,437
Don't apologize.

19
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,440
From the moment the bus
left Osaka last night,

20
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,403
I've been itching to tell that story
and finally get some respect.

21
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,864
To tell you the truth...

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,493
I feel depressed every season of the year.

23
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:28,333
Maybe my ancestors were in
a life-or-death situation all year round.

24
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,795
I wonder.

25
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,944
Play it properly!

26
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,908
I'm talking to you.

27
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,711
You're here to express something, right?

28
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,798
I've never seen that instrument before.

29
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,466
It's hella cool.

30
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,303
Why are you being so mean?

31
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,515
Play it from your soul!

32
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,893
I'm not getting into this.

33
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,937
Not getting into what?

34
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,109
Does he think I'm crazy or something?

35
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,027
You're totally crazy.

36
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,239
Sorry about this.

37
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,493
Could you play just a bit?

38
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,953
Something from your soul.

39
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,496
Then we'll leave.

40
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,719
The Drum-Drum Man!

41
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,471
The Bright-Red-Hat Man!

42
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,348
Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!

43
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,351
The Drum-Drum Man!

44
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,687
The Bright-Red-Hat Man!

45
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,564
Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!

46
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,652
The Drum-Drum Man! The Bright-Red-Hat Man!

47
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,321
Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!

48
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,699
The Drum-Drum Man!

49
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,909
The Bright-Red-Hat Man!

50
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,537
Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!

51
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,915
The Drum-Drum Man!

52
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,836
The Drum-Drum Man!
Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming!

53
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,254
Master!

54
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,923
Whoa! Let's go!

55
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,358
Thanks, man!

56
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,530
Let's go!

57
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,685
<i>Some moments are beautiful.</i>

58
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,771
<i>Vivid and radiant.</i>

59
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,274
<i>It's our job to make a mess of them.</i>

60
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,277
<i>When we succeed,</i>

61
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,654
<i>we transcend beyond reality,</i>

62
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,199
<i>to a world of staggering beauty.</i>

63
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,920
"The Drum-Drum Man.

64
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,006
The Bright-Red-Hat Man."

65
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,676
"Dragon, wake up! With all this drumming."

66
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,388
That bit was the dorkiest.

67
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,182
The rhythm sucked, too.

68
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,810
Dragons are extremely cool.

69
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,354
We had to be extremely dorky.

70
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,398
Always go to the extreme.

71
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,610
We have to be extreme to beat the system.

72
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,114
"To beat the system."

73
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,785
That's such an extremely
clichéd thing to say.

74
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,750
The problem with being extreme is:

75
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,379
If everyone does it, we'll have chaos.

76
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,133
If we do the opposite...

77
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,845
If we reject anything that's new,

78
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,013
we can only differ in skill level.

79
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,351
If we aim for a nice mixture of
innovation and tradition,

80
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,187
everyone will fight to be well-balanced.

81
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,898
You're right.

82
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,900
I agree.

83
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,820
What does that mean?

84
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,865
That means we can't all adhere
to just one school of thought.

85
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,539
I hate people who cater to the masses.

86
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,875
They make everyone happy.

87
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,752
But they'll never make anything amazing.

88
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,005
Indeed.

89
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,093
When you are a creator,

90
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,055
you have to keep your eyes open.

91
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,099
Well...

92
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,603
That's what I keep telling myself.

93
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,026
This coffee's good.

94
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,903
Yes, it is.

95
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,450
May I adhere to your
school of thought now?

96
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,744
Yeah, adhere to it.

97
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,872
"Adhere to it"?

98
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,555
Boss, check please.

99
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,808
Thank you.

100
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,853
It's still raining, so...

101
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,647
You can keep it.

102
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,273
You don't mind?

103
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,902
I brought a foldable one. Please take it.

104
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,032
Thanks. I'll use it well!

105
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,284
KICHIJOJI STATION

106
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,578
Why did it stop raining?

107
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,830
If it's gonna rain, it should pour!

108
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,874
It ruined his kindness.

109
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,209
It sure did.

110
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,046
So...

111
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,257
Back at the cafe...

112
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:43,888
Did you notice I tried not to make
any noise when I put the cup down?

113
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,808
-I did.
-Then say something!

114
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,812
I know I started it,
but I couldn't stop otherwise.

115
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,481
-I noticed from the start.
-Then say something!

116
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,816
From the start?!

117
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,777
I saw you peeking at me
every time you put it down.

118
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,863
Then say something. I feel so lame.

119
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,240
What's with that?

120
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,290
"The Drum-Drum Man"?

121
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,002
The Drum-Drum Man.

122
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,295
The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

123
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,507

AUDITION NOTICE: "THE COMEDY SPLASH"

144
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,397
HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS

145
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,024
You know that theater?

146
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,442
Yes.

147
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,904
Young comedians often play there,
so we know it well.

148
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,616
-Wanna audition?
-We can audition?

149
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,993
It's your second year in the business.

150
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,912
It's time for some results.

151
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,581
The more you go on stage,

152
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,710
the easier it will be
to pitch you to TV networks.

153
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,213
Thank you. We'll do our best.

154
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,090
The audition's tonight.

155
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,549
Go get 'em.

156
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,645
I'm sorry. Please!

157
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,316
If you keep changing the shift,
why should I bother making a schedule?

158
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,902
-But tonight's really important--
-Young man!

159
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,239
Do you remember the last time
I let you off?

160
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,907
You swore to me.

161
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,619
"It's really important.
It won't happen again."

162
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,455
Your words.

163
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,416
Remember?

164
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,709
It sounds vaguely familiar.

165
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,211
Playing stupid?

166
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,004
"Vaguely familiar"?

167
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,257
But I really must go.

168
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,635
Then go.

169
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,637
Thank you!

170
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,266
And don't worry about coming back.

171
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,893
Does that mean...

172
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,687
You're fired.

173
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,940
But, boss...

174
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,111
That hurt!

175
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,529
My knee!

176
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,905
You are fired!

177
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,323
Fired!

178
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,869
He will make this helicopter disappear.

180
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,331

00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,255
It disappeared!

182
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,134
Hello! I'm a human stomach!

183
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,052
Say it louder!

184
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,721
Ba...

185
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,681
na...

186
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,975
na.

187
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,895
Samurai boy!

188
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,939
Thanks, honey.

189
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,441
Okay.

190
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,612
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

191
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,865
Next.

192
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,909
Excuse me.

193
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,746
Hello.

194
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,956
I'm the third-generation <i>oyabun...</i>

195
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>Hi, parrot, I'm home.</i>

196
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,265
-Dear owner!
-Yes, cute bird?

197
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,520
This may be hard to believe,
but a witch has put a spell on me.

198
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,271
-I used to be a bird.
-The bird became a bird?!

199
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,190
But I wasn't a parrot. I was

200
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,566
a slightly bigger bird.

201
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,652
"A slightly bigger bird"?
Isn't that vague?

202
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:12,365
Could you fetch the magic flower for me?
It's a 7-day hike up the Cliff of Death.

203
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,658
No, I can't!

204
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,911
Why should I risk my life
to make you "slightly bigger"?

205
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,579
-What?
-Aren't you ashamed?

206
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,581
-Stop it!
-You have the lowest salary--

207
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,916
Enough already!

208
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,001
You are not a cute parrot!

209
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,878
Now I've tried it, I agree.

210
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,464
-Talking parrots are cute.
-No, they're not.

211
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,883
After listening to you,
I don't want a parrot at all.

212
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,011
-Don't change your mind so easily!
-Why are you angry?

213
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,096
-Don't change!
-Shut up!

214
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,097
-Don't change!
-Shut up!

215
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,098
-Don't change!
-Shut up!

216
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,182
-Don't change!
-Shut up!

217
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,018
-Is this how summer festivals originated?
-I've had enough.

218
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,353
Thank you.

219
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,317
What did you think?

220
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,572
Any feedback would be appreciated.

221
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,493
Your setups and your payoffs
are too complex!

222
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,122
We want it simple.

223
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,541
A nice hook. A catchy gag.

224
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,418
Where were they?!

225
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,088
As for your setup:
"I want to buy a parrot"?

226
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,590
You think that's good?

227
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,884
So, you guys own parrots?

228
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,887
No.

229
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,474
No wonder your act lacks reality.

230
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,853
If you want people to laugh,

231
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,855
buy a parrot!

232
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,898
Sorry.

233
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,903
Please go ahead.

234
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,953
-So, which is better?
-What?

235
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,498
-A budgerigar or a cockatiel?
-Why take his advice?

236
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,251
-Are cages expensive?
-Why buy one?

237
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,046
He was totally off the mark.

238
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,173
How depressing.

239
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,095
Maybe we should do ten gags each
at the start of our <i>manzai</i> act.

240
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,305
Are you serious?

241
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,433
No way. Not if my life depended on it.

242
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,354
-"Gag! Do a catchy gag!"
-Stop making fun of him.

243
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,648
What a joke. "Buy a parrot!"

244
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,698
You're late. How was it?

245
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,742
Yurie! Long time no see.

246
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,870
Toku-chan, your hair's grown.

247
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,121
It's been that long?

248
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,292
Short hair suits you better.
Like when you played soccer.

249
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,752
I was a skinhead!

250
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,129
What's up?

251
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,923
He said your audition was close by,

252
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,468
so I waited to go home together.

253
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,679
You two really are in love.

254
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,722
When will you break up?

255
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,890
-Never!
-Never!

256
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,853
We'll be together forever.
No doubt about it.

257
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,024
So, how was it?

258
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,026
It totally sucked.

259
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,654
We are surrounded by idiots.

260
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,615
Tokyo has way too many idiots!

261
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,117
Say that again!

262
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,414
Were they mean to you?

263
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,290
They said, "Make it simpler."

264
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,459
They totally panned our act.

265
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,920
This is depressing.

266
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,923
I wanna die.

267
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,884
Shall we?

268
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,052
We're out.

269
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,931
-Why did you climb that thing?
-Why did I climb it?

270
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,975
He knows.

271
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,394
Yeah, we're a duo.

272
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,895
So, why?

273
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm cool.

274
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,236
Bye.

275
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,113
See you around, Toku-chan.

276
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,906
Good night.

277
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,125
Can I keep a parrot at your place?

278
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,169
Nope. I'm allergic to birds.

279
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,963
Please. I'll let you clean up after it.

280
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,923
That's even worse.

281
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,477
"Hello. We're Sparks.
Please enjoy the show."

282
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,901
Excuse me.

283
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,907
We just saw your act. It was really funny.

284
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,913
Thanks.

285
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,373
Do you write the jokes, Big Bro?

286
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,126
I do, but...

287
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,628
"Big Bro"?

288
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,339
-We're not that close.
-But you're our senior.

289
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,925
Please let us call you "Big Bro."

290
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,637
We really like your <i>manzai,</i>
Mr. Tokunaga.

291
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,933
We saw your act in Shibuya last month.
It was amazing!

292
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,852
You're the only ones who've said that.

293
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,938
What?! That can't be true!

294
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,235
Drink up. I've got the bill.
Order whatever you want.

295
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,986
But we invited ourselves.

296
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,238
You stupid?

297
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,866
In the world of comedians, big brothers
always pay for little brothers.

298
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,827
He's the man!

299
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,869
Thanks.

300
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,913
Excuse me!

301
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,874
-Two beers.
-Two beers? Sure.

302
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,709
-Big Bro?
-Another highball.

303
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,878
-And a highball.
-One highball? Okay.

304
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,589
-Shrimp and mayonnaise, too.
-Shrimp and mayo?

305
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,759
-And some fried chicken.
-Fried chicken.

306
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,887
-And 200 varieties of sashimi.
-They don't have that many!

307
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,097
Right?

308
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,141
-They don't scour the ocean bed.
-Thanks, guys.

309
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,354
I saw you in Kichijoji the other day.

310
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,316
You were with Mr. Kamiya from Ahondara,
weren't you?

311
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,028
Yeah.

312
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,490
We had a show with Ahondara
the other day.

313
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:51,161
They didn't fit in with
the other big brothers at all.

314
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,204
Remember?

315
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,915
They had a vibe that wasn't really nice.

316
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,795
And his partner, Mr. Ohbayashi?

317
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,964
They say he was
a famous thug in his ghetto.

318
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,051
Back in Osaka, he beat up
a director he didn't like.

319
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,221
Now they can't perform
on any stage in Osaka.

320
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,223
Really...

321
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,309
The funny thing about Ahondara is

322
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,646
some comedians think really highly
of them, right?

323
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,857
When they came to Tokyo, the rumor was:

324
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,985
"Osaka sent us 'The Eye of a Typhoon.'"

325
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,863
But to be honest, I don't get them.

326
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,867
They're too extreme from the first joke.

327
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,911
They want to be special
and they shove it in your face.

328
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,789
They leave the audience behind,
and they're like:

329
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,542
"We're sharp as razor blades.
Aren't we cool?"

330
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,795
In the end,
a small minority find them funny.

331
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,881
But everyone else is like, "Huh?"

332
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,843
They came from Osaka as
"The Eye of a Typhoon" but to be honest,

333
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,511
they're all bark and no bite.

334
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,973
"The Eye of a Typhoon"?
Isn't that the quietest part?

335
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,227
-Good point.
-They're so lame.

336
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,189
It's sunny in the eye of a typhoon.

337
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,068
Ahondara totally sucks.

338
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,904
They have no hope at all...

339
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:08,781
Sorry.

340
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,824
I have to meet someone.

341
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,911
-Make this our last drink?
-Sure. No problem.

342
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,924
Thank you.

343
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,760
Excuse me...

344
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,930
Are you a comedian?

345
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,348
Yeah.

346
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,852
I really love comedy.

347
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,187
You do?

348
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,647
Good luck!

349
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,107
Thanks.

350
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,776
Sleep well!

351
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,613
Well, it's night.

352
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,908
Sleep well!

353
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,119
-Thanks for that!
-It was nothing.

354
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,870
Thank you. See you again soon!

355
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,540
Big Bro! We are funny!

356
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,918
Let's go to the top!

357
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,045
We're funny, Big Bro!

358
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,173
-Goodbye!
-Let's do it again, Big Bro!

359
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,758
Big Bro!

360
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,233
Hello?

361
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,694
<i>Where are you?</i>

362
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,737
I'm in Shinjuku.

363
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,241
<i>Where are you really?</i>

364
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,910
On a street, in Shinjuku.

365
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,163
<i>Wow.</i>

366
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,416
<i>Gonna tell me where you are?</i>

367
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,129
Somewhere shallow in the Mariana Trench.

368
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,922
<i>You are?</i>

369
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,677
<i>If you're there now,</i>
<i>you're free tomorrow, right?</i>

370
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,683
Hey!

371
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,945
What's with your outfit?

372
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,575
It's a high-tech battle-suit.

373
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,912
-Master.
-What?

374
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,999
-What part-time job do you have?
-Day labor. Paid up front.

375
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,461
-Isn't that tough work?
-It's a piece of cake.

376
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,924
It's just demolition work,
but the guys there are crazy.

377
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,926
It's a great laugh.

378
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,680
Today I went to an embassy
and smashed it down.

379
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,850
I'm covered in dust.

380
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,519
-You are.
-Yep.

381
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,151
Why close the door?!

382
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,324
It's hard to criticize people, isn't it?

383
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,457
If you have to criticize logically, yeah.

384
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,088
Harsh criticism really takes its toll.

385
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,843
Those annoying old critics are the worst.

386
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,848
They snap the shoots off young trees
without a second thought.

387
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,519
Couldn't they watch over us
with a warm smile?

388
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,940
They trash us before we become ripe.
What a waste!

389
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,652
When little shoots become
big branches on old trees,

390
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,571
that's when they're funny.

391
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,618
There's one thing I can say for sure.

392
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,746
When you start to criticize others,

393
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,916
you start to lose it as a <i>manzai</i> artist.

394
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,505
But...

395
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,677
I don't think we can avoid
being judgmental about things.

396
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,137
Well...

397
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,016
The only thing you can do
is act like an idiot.

398
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,895
Just be true to your feelings.

399
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,231
Judge things by whether
they're funny or not.

400
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,484
Without being swayed by others' opinions.

401
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,614
If I ever...

402
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,535
If I ever start to badmouth
things people have made,

403
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,413
I won't be a <i>manzai</i> artist anymore.

404
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,374
If that day comes,

405
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,043
kill me.

406
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:37,799
Know what?

407
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,679
I want to be a <i>manzai</i> artist forever.

408
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,814
-I warned you about the last train.
-It's too late now.

409
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,192
-Come to my place.
-I'll be fine.

410
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,653
-Why? Come to my place.
-I'll go home.

411
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,156
-I'm going home.
-Come to my house.

412
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,200
-It's okay.
-I'm going home.

413
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,328
-Come to my place!
-I'm going home!

414
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:11,959
This stinks.

415
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,794
It really stinks!

416
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,882
I'd like to walk home today.

417
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,884
That's what kind of day it is.

418
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,469
Oh, okay.

419
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,846
Thanks for the meal.

420
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,933
It was nothing. Nothing at all.

421
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,394
See you later.

422
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,690
Master!

423
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,535
Sleep well!

424
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,267
AT NIGHT, I CAN BREATHE...

425
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,502
Hello?

426
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,795
<i>Long time no see.</i>

427
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,005
Ayumi.

428
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,551
I was in the area,
so I dropped by the old store.

429
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,137
You surprised me, getting fired and all.

430
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,807
So, wanna catch up?

431
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,895
It was a good thing you quit.

432
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,814
That manager's sly and dirty.

433
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,650
He is, huh?

434
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,779
He kept asking me out.
It was such a pain, I quit.

435
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,822
So, that's why.

436
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,076
He kept texting me even after I quit.
Creep.

437
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,039
Even though he has no education,
he has a sex drive.

438
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,833
What does an education
have to do with sex drive?

439
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,754
I don't know.

440
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,840
What's that?

441
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,817
Know what?

442
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,779
I'm getting hooked up
with a position as a makeup assistant.

443
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,824
Wow.
You're headed straight for your dream.

444
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,911
When you're famous,
we might meet on set.

445
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,665
That's a dream within a dream.

446
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,792
That's not true.

447
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,170
When you're on stage,
you do your best, right?

448
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,215
Oh, I saw you in that magazine.

449
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,427
What magazine?

450
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,431
I forget the title. It was about comedy...

451
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,517
You were in the "Fresh New Star" column.

452
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,770
I was so happy. That's why
I went to the old store to see you.

453
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:06,813
Really?

454
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,691
-Is that so?
-Yep.

455
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,818
You're a star.

456
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,778
Far from it.

457
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:19,034
We never pass any of the auditions
for the big shows.

458
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,120
Are auditions tough?

459
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,000
At our next audition,
only three groups get through.

460
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,127
How many will participate?

461
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,754
Probably one hundred.

462
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,756
Are you serious?

463
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,634
Aren't you a little close?

464
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,725
So, it's tough in the world of comedy.

465
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,269
It sure is.

466
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,817
I was really confident at our last show,
but we bombed so badly.

467
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,779
I could hear every sound
the air conditioner made upstairs.

468
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,411
You must be too funny.

469
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,835
You're so funny, nobody understands you.
That's all.

470
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,422
Think so?

471
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,716
Definitely.

472
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,053
After all, you are funny.

473
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,518
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

474
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,151
Your smile is kinda creepy.

475
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,822
Creepy?

476
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,200
"LAUGH HARD LIVE"
AUDITION

477
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,705
<i>-Just to make things clear, I'm poisonous.</i>
<i>-Try trusting your owner!</i>

478
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,834
<i>And what kind of birds are poisonous?</i>
<i>You have no poison! You're a cute parrot!</i>

479
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,210
<i>Hi, parrot, I'm home.</i>

480
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,462
<i>-Dear owner!</i>
<i>-Yes, cute bird?</i>

481
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,967
<i>This may be hard to believe,</i>
<i>but a witch has put a spell on me.</i>

482
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,803
<i>-I used to be a bird.</i>
<i>-The bird became a bird?!</i>

483
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,806
<i>But I wasn't a parrot.</i>
<i>I was a slightly bigger bird.</i>

484
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,308
<i>"A slightly bigger bird"?</i>
<i>Be more specific!</i>

485
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,771
<i>Could you fetch the magic flower for me?</i>
<i>It's a 7-day hike up the Cliff of Death.</i>

486
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:16,234
<i>Why should I risk my life</i>
<i>to make you "slightly bigger"?</i>

487
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,111
<i>-Why the sigh?</i>
<i>-Aren't you ashamed?</i>

488
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,447
<i>-Of what?</i>
<i>-You have the lowest salary.</i>

489
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,781
<i>Shut up!</i>

490
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,326
<i>Leave my income out of it.</i>
<i>You're not a cute parrot!</i>

491
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,788
<i>No, you were right.</i>
<i>When parrots speak, they are cute.</i>

492
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,624
<i>After listening to you,</i>
<i>I don't want a parrot at all!</i>

493
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,293
Don't change your mind so easily!

494
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,669
Why are you angry?

495
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,671
-Don't change!
-Shut up!

496
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,257
-Don't change!
-Shut up!

497
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,510
-Is this how summer festivals originated?
-No idea. I've had enough.

498
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,845
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

499
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,855
Thanks, boys.

500
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,524
Been together long?

501
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,401
It's our second year.

502
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,867
We'll let you know.

503
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,806
<i>We got zero feedback.</i>

504
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,767
I thought we did well.

505
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,816
There'll be more chances.
We've only just started.

506
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,108
You're right.

507
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,254
-It's stiff.
-See ya.

508
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,261
"Hello. We're Sparks.
Please enjoy the show."

509
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,513
Woo, Sparks!

510
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,227
-It won't help?
-It won't help.

511
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,564
Not a good idea.

512
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,860
Bye.

513
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,533
Partner!

514
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,621
Sleep well.

515
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:49,322
<i>At the end of summer</i>
<i>I had a little dream</i>

516
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,868
<i>You were so cute</i>

517
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:01,459
<i>You wore a sweaty T-shirt</i>

518
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,005
<i>Oh, how I wanted to touch it</i>

519
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:12,220
<i>I got on my bike and started pedaling</i>

520
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,393
<i>I chased you and I chased you</i>

521
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:24,732
<i>But you kept running away</i>
<i>That was my dream</i>

522
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,987
<i>Please</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

523
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:33,866
<i>Let me hold</i>
<i>Oh, please let me hold</i>

524
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,036
<i>Your little white hand</i>

525
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,332
<i>Please</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

526
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:46,212
<i>Let me hold</i>
<i>Oh, please let me hold</i>

527
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,465
<i>Your little white hand</i>

528
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:57,223
<i>At the end of summer</i>
<i>The breeze and the sunset</i>

529
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,894
<i>I was trying to be strong</i>

530
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:09,861
<i>I was breathing hard as I chased you</i>

531
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:14,282
<i>But I didn't want you to hear me</i>

532
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>And yet I kept searching for you</i>

533
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:26,836
<i>In every nook and cranny in town</i>

534
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:32,842
<i>Just to see you again</i>
<i>I kept searching on</i>

535
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,555
<i>Please</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

536
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,310
<i>Let me gaze</i>
<i>Oh, please let me gaze</i>

537
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,396
<i>Into your eyes</i>

538
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,817
<i>Please</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

539
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:54,864
<i>Let me gaze</i>
<i>Oh, please let me gaze</i>

540
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,867
<i>Into your eyes</i>

541
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,455
<i>Please</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

542
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,293
<i>I beg the light that shines</i>

543
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,421
<i>Upon you in the streets</i>

544
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,801
<i>Please</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

545
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>Let me hold</i>
<i>Oh, please let me hold</i>

546
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,142
<i>Your little white hand</i>

547
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:29,232
<i>Even if I can't tell you I love you</i>

548
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,696
<i>Even if I can't tell you I love you</i>

549
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,840
My strap broke.

550
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,843
Thanks.

551
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,892
"...how summer festivals..."

552
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,228
"Don't change!"

553
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,855
"Shut up!"

554
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,859
Mr. Tokunaga?

555
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,861
It's Onodera.

556
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,875
Um...

557
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:30,793
Thank you.

558
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,881
Can we stop doing this?

559
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,552
Why?

560
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,262
Well...

561
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,849
It just doesn't feel right.

562
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,855
Don't say that.

563
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,858
Just a bit longer.

564
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,112
For just a bit longer. Please.

565
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,744
Okay.

566
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:09,916
Thank you.

567
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,876
Bye.

568
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,884
Mr. Onodera?

569
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,847
This might sound strange
after that, but...

570
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,849
Do your best.

571
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,857
Sleep well.

572
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,860
You, too.

573
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,518
Yes, this is Tokunaga.

574
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,312
We just got a call from Base Theater.

575
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,898
It was about the audition you went to.

576
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,358
<i>Yes?</i>

577
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:03,654
They said you're going to be in
their next show, or something like that.

578
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,198
For real?!

579
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,869
One hundred groups competed
for three spots, right?

580
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,870
Well done.

581
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,872
Thank you.

582
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,541
<i>Bye. You've been informed.</i>

583
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,043
Thank you.

584
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,720
Finally.

585
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,726
-We did it.
-Hey!
