WINTER, 2008

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,489
<i>These innocent-looking gentlemen</i>
<i>are Romancity!</i>

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>-I want to be number one!</i>
<i>-Stop biting me.</i>

4
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,954
<i>Beware of sudden outbursts of laughter</i>
<i>from Drizzle When We Want!</i>

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,956
<i>Why don't we go snowboarding this weekend?</i>

6
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,793
<i>Mr. Kamiya was a true </i>ahondara <i>(boofhead.)</i>

7
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>Stay tuned to </i>The Gateway to Stardom!

8
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,134
That was a bit sudden.

9
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,763
-It tastes good.
-You like it?

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,890
-You're right.
-Cut that out.

11
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,394
-Quit saying "You're right."
-It's not a "You're right" competition?

12
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,272
TOKUNAGA

13
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,898
Watch this.

14
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,275
Here goes!

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,861
The gateway for soon-to-be
up-and-coming comedians!

16
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,991
<i>Every day he preaches the gospel</i>
<i>from his </i>ahondara <i>bible.</i>

17
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,411
<i>or some reason, it draws people to him.</i>

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,206
<i>He gets spare change for his efforts.</i>

19
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>He lives each day as it comes.</i>

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,837
CARD LOAN
TOTAL DEBT: ¥120,000

21
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,509
-Okay, let's go!
-Thank you.

22
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,846
<i>He shrugs off the unimportant.</i>

23
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,890
<i>I admired that with all my heart.</i>

24
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
<i>My life was full of admiration for him.</i>

25
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,603
You've got a gun, right?

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,896
Bang, bang, bang!

27
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,773
Bang, bang!

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,233
Right in your tummy.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,861
How many months pregnant are you?

30
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,739
Is he five months pregnant? He must be.

31
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,782
You're running away?

32
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,826
Are you running away?!

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,036
Hey!

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,163
Huh? What's wrong?!

35
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>Maybe I wanted to be Mr. Kamiya.</i>

36
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,753
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

37
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,297
<i>I didn't have it in me.</i>

38
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,883
<i>I couldn't even make it close.</i>

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,472
<i>The number you are trying to--</i>

HIBANA
- Spark -

41
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,274
Welcome!

42
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,985
Can I take your order?

43
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,196
We'll have three beers.

44
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,948
And, let me see...

45
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,867
-Everything else here.
-What kind of order is that?

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,369
-Sure thing.
-She took it!

47
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,038
-Let's have this, too.
-All the drinks on the menu.

48
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,708
-You'll end up bloated.
-I always wanted to order everything.

49
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,877
And what's your order?

50
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,882
One serving of pickles.
We'll share it, so we need three plates.

51
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,384
What a downgrade!

52
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,052
Look what you did to him.

53
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,179
Sorry. Three beers.

54
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,973
-For starters.
-Okay.

55
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,433
Coming up!

56
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,895
-She was a little angry.
-Of course. She's busy.

57
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,064
That would be so annoying.

58
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,025
But you're hungry, right?
Order as much as you want.

59
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,736
Really?

60
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,698
So, things do change when you win
a trophy in the<i> New Star Battle!</i>

61
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,867
Thanks. We'll eat as much as we can.

62
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,956
Want some bread?

63
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,876
Not now?

64
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,599
Mr. Roku! Are you okay?

65
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:26,892
Are you hurt?

66
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,477
Can you stand?

67
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,854
-I'll be fine.
-Are you okay?

68
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,272
I'm okay.

69
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,941
Hold on to me.

70
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,903
This will go...

71
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,447
You want this over there?

72
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,419
You deserve this.

73
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,005
I get two?

74
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,593
What will you do with these?

75
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,679
-I'll fix them.
-Is that possible?

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,264
Of course.

77
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,600
They have to be fixed.

78
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,311
I'll send them back where they belong:

79
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,855
At the center of a family.

80
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,026
When families gather around TVs,
they come together as one.

81
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,153
They laugh and laugh.

82
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,906
They do.

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,951
I was stupid.

84
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,454
I didn't realize it was such a good job.

85
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,501
My dad owned the local
electrical appliance store.

86
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,257
When he died,

87
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,467
the store closed down.

88
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,765
I didn't do anything to thank my parents.

89
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,851
So I thought:

90
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,438
Fixing these guys is the least I can do.

91
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,986
Mr. Roku, I'm going to be on TV.

92
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,863
Congratulations.

93
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,323
-Hello.
-Hello.

94
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,741
Hello. Hello.

95
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,285
Hello!

96
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,705
-Hello. Thanks for this.
-Thank you.

97
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,998
She's here!

98
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,959
Stop looking like an amateur.

99
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,628
-Relax a bit.
-Yessir.

100
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,672
And greet people properly.

101
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,091
-Did you see her?
-You're not an amateur.

102
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,426
Tokunaga!

103
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,762
Finally!

104
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,763
Just a minute.

105
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,265
-Who's that?
-No idea.

106
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,766
-Long time no see!
-Yeah.

107
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,143
We'll go on ahead.

108
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,311
Sorry.

109
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,564
-Wow.
-What a surprise.

110
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,816
-We really met at a TV studio.
-We did.

111
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,568
-You have a shoot?
-Yeah.

112
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,695
It's our first-ever shoot.

113
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,115
I see.

114
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,908
-It's pretty crazy.
-You made it.

115
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,828
-It's nothing big yet.
-Way to go. Congratulations.

116
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,789
How are we for time?

117
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,750
-Goodbye.
-One hour.

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,960
One hour? Wanna grab some food?

119
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,670
Really? Thank you, sir.

120
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,339
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

121
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,258
See you next week.

122
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,594
Goodbye.

123
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,349
-Let's thank him for the shoot.
-Wait up, sir!

124
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,226
-Thank you!
-Good job.

125
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,896
Thank you for making me funny!

126
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,148
I'll see you again next week.

127
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,108
-You're coming again?
-Yes!

128
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,402
Are you gonna be okay?

129
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,322
I'm Shikatani. You can't go wrong!

130
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,324
You got it.

131
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,159
Get outta the way.

132
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,995
-Don't forget it next week.
-Thank you!

133
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,457
Hey.

134
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,751
-Say goodbye properly.
-I'm sorry.

135
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,169
Your act's funny.

136
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,297
But without the small talk,
you'll go nowhere in this industry.

137
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,633
-Got it?
-Yessir.

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,095
-...unavailable.
-The voicemail has bad reception, too?

139
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,597
-Prr... Prr... Prr...
-Hello? Hello!

140
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,848
-It's Pegasus.
-Pegasus!

141
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,892
I've had enough.
Thank you.

142
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,562
THE GATEWAY TO STARDOM!

143
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,316
Cut! We'll check that.

144
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,699
-That went pretty well.
-Thank you.

145
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,785
-Why are your ties a different color?
-Leave our ties alone.

146
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,836
-It's strange to see us inside the screen.
-It is.

147
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,046
They shot us well.

148
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,467
The camera likes me more.

149
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,261
-I look...
-You're too white.

150
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,762
Move it.

151
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,140
Get out of the way.

152
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,850
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

153
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,852
-Play it.
-Why did you sit there?

154
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,645
Play it.
Play it!

155
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,606
<i>I hate it when I get that message:</i>

156
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,152
<i>"The number you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is currently unavailable."</i>

157
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,320
It's funny.

158
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,114
Excuse me.

159
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,949
It's here!

160
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,284
Wow!

161
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,330
You've got balls,
sitting in my chair and all.

162
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,584
-Give me a break, sir.
-We're sorry.

163
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,669
He'll never let you forget it.

164
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,797
But you have a story to tell
when I'm famous, right?

165
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,841
-Don't get carried away.
-Sorry.

166
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,802
There's a good chance you will be famous.

167
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,766
All you need now is a catchy,
stylish opening hook.

168
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,933
You think so?

169
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,771
I'm Shikatani. You can't go wrong!

170
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,607
That's it. That's what you need.

171
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,528
-Trust me. You should try it.
-Okay. We'll make one.

172
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,696
We will.

173
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,824
Sorry we're late! We are so very late!

174
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,159
We are late!

175
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,869
-Sorry!
-Sorry!

176
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,039
-What are you doing?
-We are so sorry.

177
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,625
-This is how sorry we are.
-This is how sorry we are.

178
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,463
Hear that?

179
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,841
-What's that sound?
-His bones are cracking.

180
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,845
-He'd already taken off his shirt.
-Shh. It's a trade secret.

181
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,848
You don't wear a shirt?

182
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,935
-He always wears a jacket and no shirt.
-Really?

183
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,522
-It's how they dress where he comes from.
-Excuse me.

184
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,110
Hello?

185
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,404
<i>Where are you?</i>

186
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,492
The planet of the future, Ganymede.

187
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,870
<i>No...</i>

188
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,540
<i>Where are you?</i>

189
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,916
Ginza.

190
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,837
You're drinking
in a mighty fine neighborhood.

191
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,756
They have rundown bars in Ginza?

192
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,842
Something like that.

193
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,052
<i>I see.</i>

194
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,930
Where are you, Mr. Kamiya?

195
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
<i>I'm in Ikejiri.</i>

196
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,563
<i>I was by myself, so I thought</i>
<i>you might want to come.</i>

197
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,939
I'll join you.

198
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,482
Yes.

199
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,403
<i>From Ginza it'll take you</i>
<i>30 minutes or so.</i>

200
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,197
Sorry. I'll be right there.

201
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,408
I'm leaving now.

202
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,787
Are you trying to tell a joke?

203
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,873
-I'm telling the truth.
-No way!

204
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,834
-I saw it on TV.
-What's a "bonobo"?

205
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,836
Excuse me.

206
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,756
-Can I excuse myself for the night?
-You're going home?

207
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,258
I think I have a cold.

208
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,761
I wouldn't want to spread it around.

209
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,222
Why didn't you tell us? Go home.

210
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,682
Excuse me.

211
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,184
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

212
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,728
Goodbye.

213
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,772
-Excuse me.
-Good night!

214
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,816
I'm going to the toilet.

215
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,742
Hey. You don't have a cold.
Where are you going?

216
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,119
-I gotta go.
-What's that mean?

217
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,497
The producer brought us here.
This is a really important time for us.

218
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,875
-I know.
-Do you really?

219
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,878
Even Shikatani is sucking up hard.
He wants to be big.

220
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,589
-He's not as innocent as he looks.
-I'm sorry.

221
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,841
I need some treatment.

222
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,192
Keep the change. Thanks.

223
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,740
Hello.

224
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,492
Sorry.

225
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,870
Little lady, beer please.

226
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,417
It's been a while.

227
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,211
It has?

228
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,264
Light me.

229
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:47,976
Ouch.

230
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,189
You got here quick.

231
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,900
Here you go.

232
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,486
-Excuse me.
-Thanks.

233
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,498
You look good.

234
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,542
I'm fantastic.

235
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,628
Please run for governor
in the next election.

236
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,966
You said the same thing last time.

237
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:22,885
You're acting strange.

238
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,804
-I am?
-Yeah.

239
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,849
If <i>you're</i> calling me strange,
then I must be.

240
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,149
-Been to Inokashira Park lately?
-I go every now and then.

241
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,277
I went the other day.

242
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,863
I saw that man.

243
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:42,947
Who?

244
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,866
The Drum-Drum Man.

245
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,617
The Bright-Red-Hat Man?

246
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,119
Yep.

247
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,330
He was singing my song.
Without my permission.

248
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,710
-You should get royalties.
-You're right.

249
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,172
-The Drum-Drum Man.
-The Drum-Drum Man.

250
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,424
-The Drum-Drum Man.
-The Drum-Drum Man.

251
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,843
-The Bright-Red-Hat Man.
-The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

252
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,846
Dragon, wake up!
With the sound of the drum!

253
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,223
-The Drum-Drum Man.
-The Drum-Drum Man.

254
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,601
-The Drum-Drum Man.
-The Drum-Drum Man.

255
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,895
-The Bright-Red-Hat Man.
-The Bright-Red-Hat Man.

256
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,521
-Dragon, wake up!
-Dragon, wake up!

257
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,858
Excuse me.
You're Sparks' Tokunaga, aren't you?

258
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,362
I loved your act at the<i> New Star Battle</i>.
I became a fan!

259
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,905
Can I shake your hand?

260
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,074
-Thank you!
-Later.

261
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,909
-Wait up, sir.
-Can we have a photo?

262
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,162
The Drum-Drum Man.

263
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,039
Could you get a bit closer?

264
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,874
Say "cheese"!

265
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,130
I will never, ever catch up to Mr. Kamiya.

266
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,971
HYUGA AGENCY

267
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,766
We're getting nice feedback about you.

268
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,936
You got offers
for a radio gig and a live show.

269
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,815
It's the first time I ever
double-booked someone.

270
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,858
That's not a good thing.

271
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,569
I thought we'd get some weekly TV shows.

272
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,197
I guess this is what happens
when you finish third.

273
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,783
I should've chosen
the more expensive place.

274
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,703
You're asking too much.
You've come a long way.

275
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,789
Your new house
brought you enough luck.

276
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,543
They said the higher the rent,
the more work I'd get.

277
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,253
But we have no weekly jobs.

278
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,797
I should've gone for the ¥250,000 place.

279
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,298
How much do you pay now?

280
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,675
¥200,000.

281
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,802
-¥200,000!
-That's expensive.

282
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,012
But I'm with my girlfriend.
We pay half each.

283
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,598
-You really pay?
-Yeah, I do!

284
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,351
Why don't you move, too?

285
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,816
Good idea. If you move house,
maybe you'll get that weekly show.

286
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,738
Yeah. If you live somewhere more
expensive, you'll work even harder.

287
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,408
Why not try it?

288
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,329
Okay. Go back.

289
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,040
Wait. I can't see behind me.

290
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,868
Mr. Tokunaga!

291
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,914
Your refund from the deposit.
I did my best.

292
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,542
-That'll really help. Here's the key.
-Thanks.

293
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,795
-Thanks for having me so long.
-You kept the place so clean.

294
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,007
I wish you'd stay here longer.

295
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,346
-Have you seen Mr. Tsuyama?
-You mean old Roku?

296
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,932
I told him so many times,
but he wouldn't clean up.

297
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,352
I'm not running a charity here,
so I kicked him out.

298
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,729
You did...

299
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,444
I think I got everything. Thank you.

300
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,713
Your meal is over there.

301
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,258
Yurie said she could make it on the 12th.

302
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,885
What's on the 12th? We have the day off.

303
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,179
That's why we're having
the house-warming party.

304
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,015
-For you?
-Not for me. For you.

305
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,851
-Hello.
-Hello.

306
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,729
You got Sakamoto to organize it, right?

307
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,899
He said there are too many guys,
so I had to bring my pretty girlfriend.

308
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,277
-What's with that?
-You haven't heard?

309
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,529
He's invited a bunch of people.

310
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,073
He's probably invited Ahondara, too.

311
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,827
Mr. Kamiya, you may have heard,
but I've moved house.

312
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,870
-Your meal is ready.
-Thanks.

313
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,583
-I wonder what bra size she has.
-Cut it out.

314
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,792
Yes.

315
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,210
<i>Where did you move?</i>

316
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,337
Shimokitazawa.

317
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,132
That's a nice neighborhood.

318
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,010
Yes.

319
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,053
So...

320
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,849
I'm holding a house-warming party.

321
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,352
I was wondering if you could make it.

322
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,688
When is it?

323
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,149
Next week, on the 12th.

324
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,859
I've got work.

325
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,279
<i>I see.</i>

326
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:34,989
Sorry.

327
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,824
<i>Not at all.</i>

328
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,453
<i>What are you doing?</i>

329
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,039
I'm with a buddy.

330
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,749
Tokunaga. Come here.

331
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,460
I'll call you again. Excuse me.

332
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,296
-Let's show Mr. Satoshima.
-Show what?

333
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,340
Our new stylish opening hook.

334
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,050
The one we made using his advice.

335
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,635
Here we go.

336
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,887
Hello, we're Sparks.
Please enjoy the show.

337
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,138
Wait.

338
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,848
-Bang, bang, bang.
-Sorry.

339
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,560
We haven't polished it up yet...

340
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,397
You have to be on the ball,
or the viewers won't side with you.

341
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,150
You've gotta bring 'em something new.

342
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,319
You decide your own future.

343
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,738
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

344
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,198
And your outfit...

345
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,036
With silver hair, you gotta be more tidy.
Wear what the girls like. Be catchy.

346
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,537
Yessir.

347
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,248
Stay on the ball. Always stay on the ball.

348
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,333
Sorry.

349
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,085
Thanks for your advice!

350
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,716
We had an agreement. Why didn't you do it?

351
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,510
Nobody will laugh. It's not funny.

352
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,596
Hey.
Mr. Satoshima's giving us advice.

353
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,765
Stay on the ball.

354
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,976
-Don't be influenced so easily.
-I'm not.

355
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,646
All we have to be is more catchy.

356
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,774
Make our outfit more catchy,
stay on the ball.

357
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,860
If you focus on the masses,
it makes sense.

358
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,447
Enough with that.
Stop doing whatever you're told.

359
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,574
What a day.

360
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,294
This place is great!

361
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,839
-Think so?
-The floor's not tatami anymore.

362
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,466
-Big sister, thank you.
-Eat up.

363
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,470
-It gets lots of sunlight.
-It won't last long.

364
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,891
-It's so lovely and white.
-White makes dirt stand out more.

365
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,853
Toku-chan, this place is great!

366
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,021
-Ow.
-Are you okay?

367
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,316
-You shouldn't have left it there.
-Don't kick it!

368
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,776
Sorry.

369
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,822
But it's so spacious, in Shimokita,
for just ¥120,000 a month. Wow.

370
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,073
It's probably haunted.

371
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,870
-It's a shame about the eye contact.
-Yeah.

372
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,834
THE NEW COMEDY STAR BATTLE
3RD PLACE

373
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,002
KAMIYA'S BIOGRAPHY
VOL. 8

374
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,838
Maa-kun, take off your coat.

375
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,632
That's the seventh time.
I'm not taking it off.

376
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,884
I said it that much?

377
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,428
-Maa-kun.
-Don't call me "Maa-kun."

378
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,847
Big bro. Big bro!

379
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,850
-Not Maa-kun. Big bro, look at me.
-I am.

380
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,480
-I'm gonna follow you forever.
-Me, too.

381
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,482
You're creepy.

382
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,195
-He's the kindest big bro ever.
-He's not kind. He's just gullible.

383
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,406
Otherwise he wouldn't hang around
with that boofhead Kamiya.

384
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,824
Whatever.

385
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,285
Isn't Mr. Kamiya coming?

386
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,037
He's got work.

387
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,249
Is Ahondara okay?
I heard they got into trouble again.

388
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,294
They were the warm-up act for a TV show,

389
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,422
but they got into a fight
with a member of the audience.

390
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,840
-Really?
-Yeah.

391
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,468
The host of the show got angry.

392
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,678
They ruined the whole shoot.

393
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,431
What'll happen to them?

394
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,143
It sounds like a big problem.
They'll probably never be on TV.

395
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,315
I guess they sealed their fate
at the <i>New Star Battle</i>.

396
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:01,821
If they did their second act properly,
they'd be living in a place like this now.

397
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,783
Would you like some more?
I'll pour it for you.

398
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:11,705
People say Ahondara is trying to create
something nobody's seen before.

399
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,917
But at the end of the day,
they're just not funny, right?

400
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,919
What else would you call it?

401
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,338
The audience doesn't laugh
at their <i>manzai.</i>

402
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,048
Is that <i>manzai?</i>

403
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,889
But he never runs away from the challenge.

404
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,643
The New Star Battle was funny, right?

405
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,854
It was the funniest.

406
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,732
I guess it was.

407
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,863
I wonder what comedy is.

408
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,046
-Talk of the devil?
-Really?

409
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,048
I always call him Kamiya<i>-san.</i>

410
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,883
-You never add <i>"san."</i>
-Yes, I do.

411
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,886
-Right, Yurie?
-Add <i>"san"</i> to the end of her name!

412
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,513
Hey!

413
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,849
Hold the top.

414
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,183
It's okay.

415
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,852
Put it down.

416
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,813
CONGRATULATIONS

417
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,858
-What is it?
-A house-warming gift from Mr. Kamiya.

418
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,569
A house-warming gift? It's huge!

419
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,904
It's perfect.

420
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,656
How is it perfect?

421
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,491
It's just the right size.

422
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,703
"Phoenix."

423
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,514
Sparks sure are funny.

424
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,517
-That went well.
-Thank you.

425
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,935
That gag worked.

426
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,730
That's a terrible impersonation.

427
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,315
You can do it.

428
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,566
Thanks.

429
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,817
I told you.

430
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,320
If you take my advice,
everything will work out.

431
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,822
-You were so right. Right?
-Yes.

432
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,533
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

433
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,494
Here goes.

434
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,497
Your flyers are ready!

435
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,333
And here's your Valentine's chocolate.

436
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,877
-I don't get her jokes.
-It's just coffee.

437
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,633
-They do look better with color.
-Yep.

438
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,177
-They're pretty.
-Even the paper's different.

439
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,470
Nice.

440
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,847
It was so rough before.

441
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,516
Don't kiss them!

442
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,851
Don't kiss the hall's name!

443
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,524
JUNE 23, 2008

444
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,868
What are you doing?
That's not who they are!

445
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,842
Hello. We're Sparks.
Please enjoy the show.

446
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,682
We hope... you enjoy... the show...

447
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,767
Hear it sizzle?

448
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,228
I put out the embers.
Mimic us if you wish.

449
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,647
Please enjoy the show.

450
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,190
Why sigh?

451
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,818
We've gotta do our best. Don't sigh.

452
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,863
What's wrong? Don't sigh!

453
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,824
-Hi. We're Sparks--
-We did that already.

454
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,660
-You hit my ribs.
-We did it?

455
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,203
-This is crazy.
-It's not.

456
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,831
Come back to us.
Why are you acting so strange?

457
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,874
-Am I strange?
-Yeah.

458
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,792
-Am I sick?
-I don't know.

459
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,712
Do you have some kind of illness?
Is something wrong?

460
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,797
-I feel bad.
-You feel bad?

461
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,843
Apparently he feels bad.
Tell us your symptoms.

462
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,052
You don't mind?

463
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,432
Well, lately, my heart's been thumping.
It comes right out of the blue.

464
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,808
That doesn't sound good.

465
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,895
-It happens when I think about this girl.
-It's called love.

466
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,441
It's nothing complex.
You're in love. That's all.

467
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,444
-It only happens when I think of her.
-That's what love is!

468
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,529
Your heart thumps 'cause you're in love.

469
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,323
It might be idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy--

470
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,491
What?!

471
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,036
I've never heard that before.
Don't slip in diseases with long names.

472
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,246
-What did you say?
-Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy--

473
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,873
Slow down! Say it again.

474
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,793
-Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
-I don't get it!

475
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:26,960
"Love" is one syllable.

476
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,839
Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy?
That's 15 syllables.

477
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,800
"Love" is one.
You're in love!

478
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,804
-But sometimes my pulse races.
-Because you have a crush on her.

479
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,057
-I have idiopathic dilated <i>crush-</i>opathy?
-It's not "<i>crush-</i>opathy."

480
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,976
It's "cardiomyopathy."
And you don't have it.

481
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,103
-But there's more.
-More of the same?

482
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,773
My boring old surroundings
have started to sparkle.

483
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,857
That's love!

484
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,235
When things sparkle, you're in love!

485
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,488
-Sometimes I find myself skipping.
-That's love!

486
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,490
When people skip, they're in love.

487
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,284
-And lately... I like gummy bears.
-Huh?!

488
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,538
You only just started to like them?

489
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,291
-Gummy bears have started to sparkle.
-That's just the sour powder on them!

490
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,002
It's sour. You ate it, right?

491
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,673
Even gummy bears that don't have
sour powder on them sparkle.

492
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,385
There's more. I usually listen to
hard-core punk rock.

493
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,847
-But recently I like Dreams Come True.
-That's love!

494
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,766
-They sing the best love songs.
-I like "Our Future II."

495
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,811
That's the best song!
It's a great love song.

496
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,937
But it's not just music.

497
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,773
My favorite film is Kurosawa's
<i>Seven Samurai.</i>

498
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,358
That's a classic.

499
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,319
-My new favorite is <i>Sky of Love.</i>
-You're in love!

500
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,738
You said the word yourself!
You're in love!

501
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,866
<i>Sky of Love? </i>You're in love!

502
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,867
It's love!

503
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:44,872
They say that girls with blood type B make
a good match for boys with blood type O.

504
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,791
-Yeah, I've heard that.
-Her blood type is B.

505
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,211
My blood type is O.
That means we're a perfect...

506
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,713
You're in love!

507
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,715
You're in love!

508
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,842
You've become a totally different person!

509
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,011
Love! Love! Love!

510
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,846
Hey! Stop it!

511
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,265
Come back. What are you doing?

512
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,100
You're skipping!

513
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,019
Don't skip!

514
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,897
You're in love!
That's what's wrong with you!

515
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,191
What are you doing now?

516
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,776
Huh?

517
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,820
-Yamashita.
-What?

518
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,239
-I wonder...
-What?

519
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,743
Do you believe in fate?

520
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,829
Fate?

521
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,706
I guess so.

522
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,666
You see...

523
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,085
I am...

524
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,089
-I'm in love.
-He said it!

525
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,845
You admitted you're in love!
You knew it all along!

526
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,640
-She loves me. She loves me not.
-She loves me. She loves me not.

527
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,933
You're in love!

528
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,393
You're in love, right?

529
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,813
You keep on talking about love.
I can't see this ever ending.

530
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,024
-What?
-I can't see an end to this.

531
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,068
-Of course you can't see it.
-Why?

532
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,653
You know what they say.

533
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,072
Love makes you blind.

534
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,077
-He doesn't eat them!
-It's okay.

535
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,830
-No signatures, either.
-It's okay.

536
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,628
-Wow.
-Sorry about the fuss.

537
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,588
That was scary.

538
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,840
Tokunaga, your friend's here.

539
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,803
-Way to go.
-Thanks.

540
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,805
It was really funny.

541
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,014
For you.

542
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,808
You didn't have to.

543
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,184
Seriously.

544
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,020
Look at all your fans.

545
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,568
I'll be right back.

546
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,529
Mr. Kamiya.

547
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,459
<i>I got a reply from him</i>
<i>for the first time in ages.</i>

548
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,336
Mr. Kamiya, are you free tonight?

549
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,714
Hurry up.
The after-party will start.

550
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,716
-Everyone's waiting.
-Sorry.

551
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,386
Um...

552
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,848
I really have to go somewhere tonight.

553
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,142
Excuse me.

554
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,644
-It's your after-party.
-Sorry.

555
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:13,854
Thank you.

556
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,298
You got here quick.

557
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,776
I didn't know you had to bleach your hair
before they put the silver in.

558
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,152
It really hurts your scalp.

559
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,907
You haven't ordered yet?

560
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,700
Beer?

561
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,497
I won't eat much.

562
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,251
I have to go somewhere later.
A friend's making dinner for me.

563
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,171
Excuse me!

564
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,007
We'll have a beer, a highball,
and some pickles.

565
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,696
Know what a real <i>manzai</i> artist is?

566
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,074
When you boil things down,

567
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,743
they'd be a <i>manzai</i> artist
even if they sold vegetables.

568
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,418
I respect people who arrive on time
and do their act, just as they practiced.

569
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:05,799
But some guys go through life without
even realizing they're <i>manzai</i> artists.

570
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,846
They don't make any fuss.
They just sell good quality vegetables.

571
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,475
They are the true funny men.

572
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,860
And then...

573
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,822
if someone realizes how funny that guy is,

574
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,408
and they go on stage and say:

575
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,494
"I have a partner.

576
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:39,458
He was born a <i>manzai</i> artist,
but he keeps forgetting it.

577
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,210
He's so stupid, he still doesn't realize.

578
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,045
He just sells vegetables.

579
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,755
Why sell vegetables?!"

580
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,384
If someone said that for them,
they'd be a true straight man.

581
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,974
Unfortunately...

582
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:01,313
if you did that in real life,
nobody would laugh.

583
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,816
So, you have to go on stage
with a spirit just as true.

584
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,195
You have to make
both kids and adults laugh.

585
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,030
You even have to make God laugh.

586
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,080
They're really good at cooking.

587
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,333
The other day they made...

588
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,086
I forget what it's called,
but it tasted great.

589
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,256
Who is this friend?

590
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,842
My woman.

591
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,428
You're hungry, right?

592
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,390
Here we are.

593
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,616
What are you doing? Hurry up.

594
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,048
Hello?

595
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,968
Coming.

596
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,844
Open!

597
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,847
Welcome home.

598
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,184
It's Mr. Tokunaga.

599
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,520
See.

600
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,939
I told you we were close.

601
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,941
-Come on in.
-Excuse me.

602
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,859
-Not at all.
-Move it.

603
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,112
Let me take that.

604
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,280
Move it!

605
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,408
I'll take your bag, too.

606
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,327
Just put it anywhere.

607
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,705
Come on in. Sorry about the mess.

608
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,831
Excuse me.

609
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,918
Please take a seat.

610
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,923
-What would you like to drink?
-Anything will do.

611
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,384
-Beer, please.
-Beer it is.

612
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,565
-Let me fill your bowl.
-Thank you.

613
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,193
-It looks delicious.
-I hope it tastes good.

614
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,410
<i>Don't bite me!</i>

615
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,205
<i>A koala wouldn't bite me because</i>
<i>it was jealous that I hugged you.</i>

616
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,833
<i>You weren't hugging a koala.</i>
<i>You were hugging me.</i>

617
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,003
<i>It was you?! Why did you bite me?</i>

618
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,298
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

619
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,217
She's a professional.

620
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,470
Eat up.

621
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,472
Here goes.

622
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,893
Tomato...

623
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,941
-How is it?
-Delicious.

624
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,904
-What a relief. Will you have some?
-Thanks.

625
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,080
-It tastes great.
-I'm glad you like it.

626
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,042
-She's a great cook.
-I am.

627
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,806
-Here you go, Sai-kun.
-Thanks.

628
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,767
But stop calling me Sai-kun.

629
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,977
Why? That's your name.

630
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,688
But Sai-kun?

631
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,231
Sai-kun is Sai-kun.

632
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,774
Right?

633
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,945
-She giggles.
-What's wrong with that?

634
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,613
Are you shy?

635
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,074
-It's good.
-Really?

636
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,910
That's good to hear.
Does it have enough flavor?

637
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,287
<i>The Gateway to Stardom!</i>

638
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,915
Eat as much as you can.

639
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,084
Oh, my.

640
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,795
It's Sparks.

641
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,214
<i>Hello. We're Sparks.</i>
<i>Please enjoy the show.</i>

642
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,883
This is kinda weird.

643
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,804
<i>We hope... you enjoy... the show...</i>

644
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,973
<i>Hear it sizzle? I put out the embers.</i>

645
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,560
<i>We gotta do our best.</i>
<i>Please enjoy the show.</i>

646
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,645
<i>Why sigh?</i>

647
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,147
<i>What's wrong?</i>

648
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,898
<i>Ms. Yuki...</i>

649
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,736
<i>She seemed like someone</i>
<i>who lived a peaceful life.</i>

650
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,864
<i>She also seemed to be very clean.</i>

651
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,784
<i>And just like another certain lady,</i>

652
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,911
<i>she laughed a lot.</i>

653
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,790
<i>As her laughter bounced off the walls,</i>

654
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,878
<i>it overlapped in my mind</i>
<i>with Ms. Maki's laughter.</i>

655
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:43,428
<i>...it happens every time</i>
<i>I think of a certain lady.</i>

656
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,014
<i>Are you serious?</i>

657
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,891
<i>That's love.</i>

658
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,976
<i>You're in love, right?</i>

659
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,645
<i>That's love!</i>

660
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,317
<i>-But it only happens when I think of her.</i>
<i>-That's love!</i>

661
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,195
<i>In everyday life,</i>
<i>I was a good-for-nothing.</i>

662
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,615
<i>But I could make Mr. Kamiya laugh a lot.</i>

663
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,952
<i>However, Mr. Kamiya wouldn't laugh</i>
<i>at the man I was on stage.</i>

664
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,914
<i>In the end...</i>

665
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,167
<i>I failed.</i>

666
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,880
<i>I couldn't break free from society.</i>

667
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,427
<i>It's love! No doubt about it.</i>

668
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,514
<i>-But there's more.</i>
<i>-More of the same?</i>

669
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,016
<i>My boring old surroundings</i>
<i>have started to sparkle.</i>

670
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,392
<i>That's love!</i>

671
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,186
<i>When things sparkle, you're in love!</i>

672
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,606
<i>Rusty guardrails along the side of</i>
<i>the road have started to sparkle.</i>

673
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,941
<i>That's love!</i>

674
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,737
<i>I don't like rice. When I have to eat it,</i>
<i>I always sprinkle something on top.</i>

675
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,825
<i>-But now I can eat rice by itself.</i>
<i>-It's love! You're sprinkling love on it!</i>

676
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,410
<i>-Lately, I like gummy bears.</i>
<i>-Huh?!</i>

677
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,330
<i>-Who cares?</i>
<i>-Yamashita, I like gummy bears!</i>

678
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,998
<i>Who cares?! Good for you!</i>

679
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,044
<i>-Gummy bears have started to sparkle.</i>
<i>-That's just the sour powder on them!</i>

680
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,879
<i>The sour powder...</i>

681
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,259
<i>He didn't think twice about saying "no"</i>
<i>to the world. He was noble.</i>

682
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,010
<i>However...</i>

683
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,431
<i>that made me hate myself.</i>

684
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,935
<i>I hated him for it so much.</i>

685
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,942
<i>There's more. I usually listen to</i>
<i>hard-core punk rock.</i>

686
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,237
<i>-But recently I like Dreams Come True.</i>
<i>-That's love!</i>

687
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,823
<i>-They sing the best love songs.</i>
<i>-I like "Our Future II."</i>

688
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,367
<i>That's the best song!</i>
<i>It's a great love song.</i>

689
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,702
<i>But it's not just music.</i>

690
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,871
<i>My favorite film is Kurosawa's</i>
Seven Samurai.

691
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:33,872
<i>That's a classic.</i>

692
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,916
<i>-My new favorite is </i>Sky of Love.
<i>-You're in love!</i>

693
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,586
Sky of Love? <i>You're in love!</i>

694
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,920
<i>It's love!</i>

695
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,903
<i>...you met your fate?</i>

696
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,656
<i>When you say fate, you mean... fate?</i>

697
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,534
<i>-That's the fate I mean.</i>
<i>-So, what happened?</i>

698
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,537
<i>-I'm in love.</i>
<i>-He said it!</i>

699
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,501
<i>You admitted you're in love!</i>
<i>You knew it all along!</i>

700
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,880
<i>We talked about your favorite movie,</i>
<i>but you were simply in love.</i>

701
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,217
<i>What's the point of this conversation?</i>
<i>I can't see an end to this.</i>

702
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,844
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-I can't see an end to this.</i>

703
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,721
<i>-Of course you can't see it.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

704
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,431
<i>You know what they say.</i>

705
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,558
<i>Love makes you blind.</i>

706
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,195
<i>Now I ask you all: Are you in love?</i>

707
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,617
Wow.

708
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,744
That was really funny.

709
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,883
You didn't like it?

710
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,055
How should I put it?

711
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,599
I think...

712
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,602
you should do whatever you want.

713
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,604
Do whatever you think is funny.

714
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,608
I can't.

715
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,905
Maybe you're thinking too much.

716
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,742
Take it easy.

717
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,411
Just do what you feel like.

718
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,551
It was that unfunny?

719
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,682
It's not that it wasn't funny.

720
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,271
I mean, I know you're funny.

721
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,777
That's why I think you can do more.

722
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,908
Why don't you go on TV and do it?

723
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,914
If you're gonna complain...

724
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,543
why don't you pass the auditions
and do funny <i>manzai</i> on TV?

725
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,645
You're right.

726
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,241
And what is that?

727
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,620
Your hair...

728
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,705
You copied me?

729
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,834
You copied my clothes, too?

730
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,640
Mr. Kamiya.

731
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,645
You said you'd rather die
than be like someone else.

732
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,776
You said you didn't even
want to imitate yourself.

733
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,532
Isn't this an imitation?

734
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,831
Well...

735
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,253
When I saw your hairstyle,

736
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,255
I thought it was cool.

737
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,473
It's an imitation.

738
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,756
<i>I can't see an end to this.</i>

739
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,633
<i>-Of course you can't see it.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

740
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,967
<i>You know what they say.</i>

741
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,136
<i>Love makes you blind.</i>

742
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,802
I tried to look like Beckham,
but I ended up like Kiyoko Suizenji.

743
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,268
You failed to look like her, too.

744
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,059
TO: SAIZOU KAMIYA
I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

745
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,299
FROM: SAIZOU KAMIYA

746
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:09,470
IT'S OKAY. I WAS SO DRUNK,
I DON'T REMEMBER A THING!

747
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,935
What are you doing? We're on soon.

748
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,272
Come on. Hurry up!

749
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,919
<i>Sparks' </i>manzai<i> show "Pops"</i>
<i>will start at 11:00.</i>

750
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,255
<i>Please come and watch.</i>

751
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:49,009
<i>Sparks' </i>manzai<i> show "Pops"</i>
<i>will start at 11:00.</i>

752
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,470

753
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,519
<i>I wondered...</i>

754
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,982
<i>Would I ever see Mr. Kamiya again?</i>
