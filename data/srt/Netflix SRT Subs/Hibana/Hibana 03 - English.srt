1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,898
You want to put that chirping bit in?

2
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,191
Can we try it?

3
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,902
-Hi, parrot, I'm home.
-I need to have a word with you.

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:27,986
-Hello.
-Hello.

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,989
-We're Sparks. I'm Yamashita.
-I'm Tokunaga.

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,283
I'm Kisarazu Rouge's Mochizuki.

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,535
I'm Iper.

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,828
Which agency are you with?

9
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:37,913
Hyuga Agency.

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,291
-Hyuga Agency.
-"Hyuga Agency"?

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,294
-Who's there?
-Tokuma Nishioka.

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,713
Sparks, you're up next.

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

14
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,468
-We're Sparks. I'm Yamashita.
-I'm Tokunaga.

15
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,845
-We're Sparks. I'm Yamashita.
-I'm Tokunaga.

16
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,888
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,307
But this guy's different...

18
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,188
-They're killing it.
-They said the crowd was tough.

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,109
Hello!

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,987
I've had enough. Thank you.

21
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,870
Thank you.

22
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,872
I think we did okay.

23
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,417
It didn't go down so well.

24
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,710
I think...

25
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,628
It's not...

26
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,882
Maybe the first joke is a little weak.

27
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,887
And maybe the number of jokes...

28
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,974
Maybe we could have a few more.

29
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,768
-Where's this coming from?
-I watched the others.

30
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,856
It seemed like we had
less jokes than the others.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,861
You don't write our material.

32
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,863
What is this?

33
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,531
No...

34
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,824
I mean...

35
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,827
It was a suggestion.
Compared to the other acts--

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,829
Are you gonna write?

37
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,372
-Hello!
-Hello!

38
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,790
May we introduce ourselves?

39
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,542
Which of you write your acts?

40
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,295
It's a joint process. During rehearsals.

41
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,884
-Okay. Thank you.
-See you around.

42
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,597
How could you say that?

43
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,892
I write our acts.

44
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,438
But I'm there for you.
We create them together.

45
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:40,869
FALL, 2001

46
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,039
Of course. I saw you.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,709
I liked your act today, but...

48
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,212
-It doesn't suit you.
-You like it, but you don't?

49
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,047
It was funny, but....

50
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,716
HARMONICA ALLEY

51
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,510
HIBANA
- Spark -

52
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,012
It's definitely Golgo.

53
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,014
Golgo 13.

54
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,642
No.

55
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,770
I believe it's someone suicidal.

56
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,022
Are you an idiot?

57
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,527
All you need is
a magician, a muscleman and Golgo.

58
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,362
You could commit the perfect crime.

59
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,492
The comic-book sniper Golgo hardly fails.

60
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,493
However...

61
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,456
You would leave a trail
paying his incredible fee.

62
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,332
That can't be helped.

63
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,669
Incredible fees are
part of the Golgo package.

64
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,422
If you have someone suicidal:

65
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,175
One side wants to kill.
The other wants to be killed.

66
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,010
Everyone has common interests.

67
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,845
The victim would even help you.

68
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,432
That's not the point.

69
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,642
The question was--

70
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,311
Here's your dick tempura.

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,188
Thanks.

72
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,274
The question was:
"If you had a magician and a muscleman,

73
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:39,571
what other specialist would you need
to commit the perfect murder?"

74
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,866
I mean,
what are suicidal people specialists at?

75
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,494
But if you had Golgo,

76
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,954
you wouldn't need the other two anyway.

77
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,043
Well, if you knew someone suicidal,

78
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:57,255
your first priority should be
to talk them out of it.

79
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,053
Are you bringing morality
into a debate about the perfect crime?

80
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,849
I wonder.

81
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,810
Okay, fine!

82
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,813
If I find someone trying
to commit the perfect murder,

83
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,397
I'll talk them out of it.

84
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,859
-It's definitely Golgo.
-I've had enough.

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,154
How many dick tempura did you order?

86
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,532
Dick tempura, please.

87
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,867
-Just one?
-We still have some.

88
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,667
Hang on.

89
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,838
I need a break.

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,217
I'm stuffed.

91
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,020
My place is close. Why not come over?

92
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,691
I need to puke so bad,

93
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,861
I'd vomit five times more than someone
on a boat of the toughest guy in town.

94
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,908
That was a poor attempt at a joke.

95
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,535
You worry me.

96
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,329
You need more training.

97
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,923
How do you kill time
until the first train comes?

98
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,304
-I catch a taxi--
-I know already!

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,849
You don't have the money to catch a taxi.

100
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,851
Too true.

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,313
When I have spare change,
I go to a manga café.

102
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,816
When I don't, there are benches.

103
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,569
I just spend the time there.

104
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,073
That's a shame.
My guess was way off target.

105
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,075
In my worst case scenario:

106
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,872
You enjoyed a campfire
with passerby goblins.

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,583
That's too crazy.

108
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,961
You're...

109
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,756
You're drunk. Come to my place.

110
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,383
-No, I'll be fine.
-Come on.

111
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,801
-I said, "No."
-Come!

112
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,054
I don't want to go...

113
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,430
-No!
-Ouch!

114
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,939
What was that for?

115
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,732
That hurt.

116
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,692
It really hurts.

117
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,862
I broke something.

118
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,827
Ouch.

119
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,331
That got my head spinning. Now I'm drunk.

120
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,833
Now I'm really drunk.

121
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,544
Now I'm...

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,632
I'm spinning all over the place.

123
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,134
I said, "Come"!

124
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,846
That hurt!

125
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,891
Why did you kick me?!

126
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,937
Don't get angry!

127
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,775
You're drunk, and I'm worried about you.

128
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,820
Why do you kick people
you're worried about?!

129
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,406
-Don't get angry.
-I don't get it.

130
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,866
Come to my place. Okay?

131
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,878
Great job, sir!

132
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,422
Well done.

133
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,680
He laughed.

134
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,348
What's he doing?

135
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,892
He's stepping on something.

136
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,061
He's having a fight with earth.

137
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,980
It's not your problem!

138
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,525
That was my bag. You missed me.

139
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,068
Missed?

140
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,697
I don't feel good.

141
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,035
Dick tempura. Definitely dick tempura.

142
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,208
Be careful.

143
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,607
How far is it?

144
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,526
We're not in Kichijoji anymore.

145
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,992
Don't say that. You make me sad.

146
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,827
What's this?

147
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,206
Why are you saying "normal" things?

148
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,838
Don't get angry.

149
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,636
Stop saying "normal" things
with a "normal" look on your face.

150
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,225
-What?
-You know what.

151
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,727
-What?
-Stop saying, "What?"

152
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,689
When you say normal things
with a normal face,

153
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,358
I know it's a joke.

154
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,443
But nobody else will get it.

155
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,864
Stop saying that.

156
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,328
If it's funny when you say
something "normal,"

157
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,831
your real idea of "normal"
must be "insane."

158
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,588
You shouldn't say bad things
about people, okay?

159
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
Watch out!

160
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,844
Are you okay?!

161
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,099
-What?
-I don't know!

162
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,311
I don't know if you really fell,
or if you're still kidding.

163
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,857
-What?
-Don't play cute.

164
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,192
Stop it, please.

165
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,196
I think you really fell over,
but pretended it was a joke

166
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,198
because it was embarrassing, right?

167
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,827
Permission to vomit?

168
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:07,250
If you go to work in the morning and find
vomit on the street, it's not nice, right?

169
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:12,714
Don't do things
you don't want done unto you.

170
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,799
You're saying "normal" things again.

171
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,176
I lose.

172
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,733
You're puking.

173
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,216
Hello?

174
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,844
You were asleep!

175
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,679
Yeah.

176
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,057
I'll be back with Tokunaga soon.

177
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,309
Yeah. Bye.

178
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:12,482
<i>The train headed for Shinjuku</i>
<i>will soon be arriving on platform three.</i>

179
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,110
This is way further
than your average walk.

180
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,543
Here it is.

181
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,170
Why did you spin around?

182
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,607
Good morning.

183
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,567
Morning.

184
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,112
Tokunaga.

185
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,739
I'm Maki.

186
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,200
Nice to meet you. I'm Tokunaga.

187
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,160
Hi there.

188
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,456
This is a bit sudden. The room's a mess.

189
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,834
It's okay.

190
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,252
Don't worry.

191
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,253
Come on.

192
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,728
Hey.

193
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,689
Give Tokunaga some water!

194
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,774
Not so loud. It's still early.

195
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,860
The people downstairs will complain.

196
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,863
Sorry.

197
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,075
Come on in!

198
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,785
Be our guest.

199
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,953
Excuse me.

200
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,128
Come on. Leave it.

201
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,839
-Don't be polite.
-I'll grab your bag.

202
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,757
Thank you.

203
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,508
Tokunaga.

204
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,178
-This way.
-Go to sleep!

205
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,680
And your water.

206
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,891
Here you go.

207
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,811
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:14,729
It's okay.

209
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,941
Drink it. Hurry up.

210
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,777
Drink it all.

211
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,861
It's yours.

212
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,863
Go to sleep.

213
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,496
I'm going to the store. Need anything?

214
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,580
No, thanks.

215
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,999
-Let's go.
-I'm sorry.

216
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,497
Aren't you cold?

217
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,041
I'll be okay.

218
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,670
I'm drunk and hot. Wear this.

219
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,547
Thanks. You're not cold?

220
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,772
He's asleep.

221
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,611
He's like an annoying little brother.

222
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,083
Here goes.

223
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,636
Let him be.

224
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,682
Let's give him a weird suntan
so he'll look like Black Jack.

225
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,059
What's funny about that?

226
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,607
Hey.

227
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,360
Covering your face is cheating.

228
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,865
You should let him sleep.

229
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,501
Stop it, please.

230
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,920
Ouch!

231
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,887
You're enjoying this!

232
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,806
I can see the smile there.
You're enjoying it.

233
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,352
-Ms. Maki, why are you helping him?
-I'm sorry.

234
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,479
You're loving this.

235
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,439
SEIWASOU APARTMENTS

236
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,909
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,287
This one's important.

238
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,460
That's a relief. It's okay.

239
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,006
It's cute, eh?

240
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,299
Yes.

241
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:31,884
Put it back.

242
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,392
Wrong place. On the side.

243
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,148
Turn it around.

244
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,360
Turn it around. It's back to front.

245
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,403
Yep.

246
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,821
That's it.

247
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,575
Thanks.

248
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,661
Want some?

249
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,872
-Sorry?
-Wanna eat some?

250
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,166
No, I'm full.

251
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,168
-It's mackerel.
-No, thanks.

252
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,169
Thank you.

253
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,889
What the hell?

254
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,186
Take a look.

255
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,899
"New Year's Eve Comedy Countdown."
They're having an audition?

256
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,611
It's the "all-star game" of comedy.

257
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,822
We know! We can audition for it?

258
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,993
I've gained a bit of clout
in the comedy industry lately.

259
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,622
Thank you.
We'll make a new routine for it.

260
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,084
-New routine?
-We gotta do what we gotta do.

261
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,838
"Pre-Opening Act"...
It's for the warm-up?

262
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,674
Boys...

263
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,343
Careers are built from the ground up.

264
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,846
It may be the warm-up act,
but if you get it,

265
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,808
it'll give you exposure
to people really into comedy.

266
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,434
-Right?
-Yep.

267
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,062
"If you want to have sex,

268
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,439
you must love the girl."

269
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,900
Wisdom from the god of porn, Taka Kato.

270
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,403
-Exactly.
-That quote...

271
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,154
How powerful!

272
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,909
We'll do it. With a new act.

273
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,912
We will get our first ever
end-of-year gig!

274
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,249
Okay. I'll make a good one.

275
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,918
-I expect a strong act.
-A strong one.

276
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,797
Hey, Mr. Speedy. Pull over.

277
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,048
Stop!

278
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,803
Drink up.

279
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,056
Thank you.

280
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,891
Let's try it.

281
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,687
-Can I hold onto this?
-Sure.

282
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,439
Any parts you find difficult?

283
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,733
I think I can do it.

284
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,901
Let's stop if I get stuck.

285
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,487
-Hello, we're Sparks.
-Please enjoy the show.

286
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,614
-Wanna hear my No.1?
-What is it?

287
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,408
-Motorcycle cop.
-Motorcycle cop?

288
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,870
I want to drive around on a cool bike
making sure everyone drives safely.

289
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,912
That's a cool job.

290
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,874
-Hey, you, pull over!
-Damn, it's a motorcycle cop.

291
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,419
-Pull over and get off your Labrador.
-I'm not riding a Labrador!

292
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,879
PRE-OPENING ACT AUDITION

293
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,006
-Is it a poodle?
-It's neither.

294
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,300
-A sausage dog?
-I'd have to squat.

295
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,887
Don't make me squat. I'm not on a dog.
I'm on the road. See?

296
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,266
-Hey, you, pull over!
-Damn, it's a motorcycle cop.

297
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,479
-Quit doing the Guess-Which-Hand thing.
-Guess-Which-Hand thing?

298
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,897
Guess-Which-Hand?

299
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,691
What's illegal about doing
that game anyway?

300
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,026
Guess which hand holds...

301
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,327
-Guess which hand holds amphetamines.
-Amphetamines?!

302
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,872
Is this a nightmare?!
If so, please wake me up!

303
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,583
I'm not holding drugs. It's the handles.

304
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,251
-You're not a dealer?
-I'm on a bike.

305
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,797
-Hey, you, pull over!
-Damn!

306
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,133
-You, on the bike, pull over now!
-It's a motorcycle cop!

307
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,760
Come to a stop!

308
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,807
Say something!

309
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,975
This is a nightmare! I want to wake up!

310
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,019
-Wake me up!
-You're awake.

311
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,521
The cop says something.

312
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,398
Thanks, guys.

313
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,943
It's nothing new.

314
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,865
You need to add more jokes. Speed it up.

315
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,244
Betray the audience's expectations...
Or it's pretty tough.

316
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,703
I mean...

317
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,164
Your act sounds false.

318
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,583
Sorry.

319
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,752
Um...

320
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,505
What was your act about?

321
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,843
Well...

322
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,596
A motorcycle cop who pulls someone over.

323
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,516
It was better than your last act.

324
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,269
Thanks.

325
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,691
-Who's next?
-Ahondara.

326
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,318
-Take a break?
-No, let's get it done.

327
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,444
Sure thing.

328
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,531
Next up is Ahondara.

329
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,700
Thanks.

330
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,582
Hey.

331
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,837
Don't stop halfway through like that.
Judges get tired, too.

332
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,798
-Of course that baldy wouldn't get it.
-Baldy?

333
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,093
-He's bald. What's with him?
-He's not that bald. And our first--

334
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,095
-He is bald.
-No, he's not.

335
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,473
-What's your problem?
-Our New Year's Eve is on the line.

336
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,810
The guy with the short sleeve vest
said we were kinda funny.

337
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,437
Don't look so shitty.

338
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,397
-Are you a wolf?
-A wolf?

339
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,315
You're a wolf.

340
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,901
No other young comedians
pick fights with the judges.

341
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,696
They'd have to be a wolf.
You're a wolf!

342
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,448
-Shut up.
-You're a wolf.

343
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,158
What's with you?

344
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,119
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

345
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,750
<i>-It's funnier that way.</i>
<i>-Okay. Whatever. Just do it.</i>

346
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,380
<i>-Wait!</i>
-What?

347
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,884
Are you prepared to laugh
for three days straight?

348
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,177
Yeah.

349
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,096
-No, you're not.
-I am.

350
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,017
Can you really cope with
laughing for three days, non-stop?

351
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,685
Even if your parents die.

352
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,562
All smiles. You can do that?

353
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,149
-Yeah, no problems.
-No problems? Your parents are dead!

354
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,859
You should be ashamed!

355
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,362
That's not what I meant. Just do it.

356
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,322
He's asleep!

357
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,205
What do you want?

358
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,415
Sorry.

359
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,090
I thought we'd do our new act
"He's Asleep" next time.

360
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,510
That's your act's title?
You guys are confusing.

361
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,765
The act was premature.
Now it's in the sewer.

362
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,856
Do you wanna take a break
from the industry?

363
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,778
Good idea. My fake illness is flaring up.

364
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,326
I've had enough. Thank you.

365
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:55,869
Get outta here.

366
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:10,426
-What a crap audition!
-Cut it out.

367
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,594
Lady, can we go home?

368
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,346
Get out.

369
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,058
-Next up, "Chinese Food All The Way."
-Thank you.

370
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,061
Make a funny face for me.

371
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,771
Leave him alone.

372
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,442
-That's average.
-Let him be.

373
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,401
Humor me.

374
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,407
That's funny.

375
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,367
But I'm funnier.

376
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,536
Who's coming for a drink?

377
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,747
Who'd go with you?

378
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,958
What's their problem? Time for a drink!

379
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,626
Mr. Kamiya.

380
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,629
-I'll join you.
-Wanna go to Harmonica Alley?

381
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,756
Where's your bag?

382
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,758
-Go get it.
-Got it.

383
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,763
-Yellow. Can you fly with that?
-I can't.

384
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,515
If you're a comedian, fly!

385
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,768
Fly on forever!

386
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,773
I always loved reading books.

387
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,399
I see.

388
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,822
When I was in elementary school,
we would go to the library.

389
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,409
The other kids all wanted to read
picture books and <i>Barefoot Gen.</i>

390
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,622
But I read biographies
about the greatest people in history.

391
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,916
Biographies. I should have guessed.

392
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,837
Know who Inazo Nitobe is?

393
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,924
He's...

394
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,092
the guy on the 5,000 yen bill?

395
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,931
He was a real troublemaker, too.

396
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,933
What did he do?

397
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,938
-I forget.
-You forget?

398
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,650
But I remember I was impressed.

399
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,777
I'll read it.

400
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,905
Know who Inazo Nitobe is?

401
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,075
He was

402
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,786
the guy who made the 5,000 yen bill?

403
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,083
The greatest people in history
all did pretty amazing things.

404
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,545
But on a personal level,
they were pretty stupid.

405
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,506
Ever since I was a kid, I thought:

406
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,009
"Everyone would be impressed
if there was a biography about me."

407
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,846
The night I promised
to write your biography

408
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,305
I bought a pen and notebook.

409
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,266
They cost more than I'd usually pay.

410
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,227
You are stupid.

411
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,813
You should've bought the cheapest

412
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,108
and made it worth 100 times more.

413
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,903
You're right.

414
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,785
Are you going home for New Year's?

415
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,913
Nope. I don't have enough money.

416
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,126
And you might be on
the New Year's Eve Comedy Countdown.

417
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,676
Come to my place for New Year's.

418
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,928
Maki said she wants to see you.

419
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,768
Know who Inazo Nitobe is?

420
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,186
The 5,000 yen bill guy.

421
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:09,730
Correct.

422
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,860
He said he'd call around lunchtime.

423
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,904
If we got the act.

424
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,615
But you heard him, too.

425
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,868
"It was better than your last act."

426
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,495
-You heard him.
-The other one was asleep.

427
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,915
-Have they called yet?
-No.

428
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,168
It's freezing out here.

429
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,920
Why don't you come in?

430
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,923
I get a rash when I go near tatami mats.

431
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,925
What's with her?

432
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,511
INCOMING CALL
"HYUGA AGENCY"

433
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:42,930
It's Mr. Ogata.

434
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,685
Hello?

435
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,104
Yes? New Year's Eve?

436
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,107
Yes? Yes. Of course we can.

437
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,902
Okay. Thank you. See you then.

438
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,992
We didn't get it.

439
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,498
We're invited to the Hyuga Agency
end-of-year party.

440
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,879
It's time I went.

441
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,547
I'll walk you there.

442
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,007
May I?

443
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,843
Tell me what went wrong?!

444
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,013
What was wrong?

445
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,683
Okay, I'm coming.

446
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,270
See ya.

447
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,901
That was a shame.

448
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,152
Yeah.

449
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,905
Better things will come next year.

450
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,950
Thanks.

451
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,914
-Any plans for New Year's?
-My parents are taking us to Hawaii.

452
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,128
Are you already over it?

453
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,714
I'm dying inside.

454
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,718
Make me feel better.

455
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,095
What can I do?

456
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,806
I think you know.

457
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,851
-Who's a good boy?
-I'm not a child.

458
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,562
I'm an adult. You know what I mean.

459
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,398
You want to do something fun?

460
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,899
Over and over again.

461
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,401
Come again?

462
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,902
Over and over again.

463
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,910
Have you ever been tied up?

464
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,290
What are they?

465
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,888
Next year, I hope you all make
even more progress.

466
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,182
That you all become big.

467
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,892
I truly do.

468
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,437
And we have some big news
for next year in television.

469
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,939
Our biggest star, Mr. Tokuma,
will be in a new show:

470
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,941
"The Happy Bus Trip."

471
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,318
"The Fun Bus Trip."

472
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,112
Whatever it's called.

473
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,490
It's a new weekly show.

474
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,867
Let's all take a ride on that.

475
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,078
Now it's time to drink. Are you ready?

476
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,621
Cheers!

477
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,914
Cheers!

478
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,834
-Cheers!
-Let's make it a good one.

479
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,425
-Delicious!
-Have some more.

480
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,718
Yes, I will.

481
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,887
Attention, everybody!

482
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,389
What is it?

483
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,140
Ta-da!

484
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,559
-It's Mr. Tokuma.
-And his "Fun Bus Trip"!

485
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,686
Mr. Tokuma's so cute!

486
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,190
Think of failure
as ammunition for your act.

487
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,359
Give it your best.

488
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,821
I went through a lot
to get you that audition.

489
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,906
-Sorry.
-We're really sorry.

490
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,784
Ladies and gentlemen!

491
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:55,205
Mr. Tokuma sent us the pure rice
extra special brew sake "Tokuma."

492
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,877
We can't bring in the New Year
without this!

493
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,882
-Is that expensive?
-Hang that up.

494
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,888
What's this?

495
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:16,226
I thought Sparks couldn't make it tonight.

496
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,353
Did we say that?

497
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,355
Don't play dumb.

498
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,734
I was looking forward to
the New Year's Eve Comedy Countdown.

499
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,987
Great English pronunciation there.
"Countdown."

500
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,489
Know what's wrong?

501
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,284
Tokunaga's not drunk enough!

502
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,454
Yamashita!

503
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,623
Thank you!

504
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,215
No way! Yamashita can drink!

505
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,634
-He can.
-Why can't you?

506
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,429
-Didn't you want to talk with Reika?
-I do.

507
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,641
-It's my lucky day.
-It is your lucky day.

508
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,060
-It's okay?
-Excuse us!

509
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,938
I found someone
who wants to talk with Reika.

510
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,950
Yeah?

511
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,662
I'm at work.

512
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,917
It's okay. But I gotta go back soon.

513
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,631
That sounds nice, but...

514
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,300
I can't get home this year either.

515
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,138
No, I'm fine.

516
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,932
There's no need to worry.

517
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,936
We passed this audition
a little while back.

518
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,897
You know the New Year's Eve
Comedy Countdown?

519
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,942
Hanshin Kyojin are on it.
We're on it, too.

520
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,947
No, we're not the warm-up act.
We got a proper slot.

521
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,743
It's okay. We've got a lot of bookings.

522
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,453
I'm okay.

523
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,584
Sorry, sis.
They're calling us. I gotta go.

524
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:05,919
Yep.

525
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,879
Yeah.

526
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,591
Tell Mom and Dad not to worry either.

527
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,063
-No touching.
-I won't.

528
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,940
-Promise?
-I won't touch them.

529
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,651
I'll get close, but I won't touch them.

530
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,241
You touched them!

531
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,910
-You hit me with the corner!
-The corner of the box?

532
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,122
You don't get to molest in the industry?!

533
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,584
Boss!

534
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,950
Thank you for the past year.

535
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,786
-I'll see you again next year.
-Thank you.

536
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,997
Have a nice New Year.

537
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,082
You, too.

538
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,468
HAPPY NEW YEAR
WE'RE CLOSED UNTIL THE 3RD

539
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,220
"I'm not riding a Labrador."

540
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,892
"Is it a poodle?"
"It's neither!

541
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,935
I'm on the road. See?"

542
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,075
"Hey, you, pull over!"
"Damn, it's a motorcycle cop."

543
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:04,537
"Stop doing Guess-Which-Hand."
"Guess Which Hand? I'm not.

544
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,666
What's illegal about doing
that game anyway?"

545
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,293
"Guess which hand holds amphetamines."

546
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,461
Which is it?

547
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,882
Amphetamines?

548
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,967
Show me your hands.

549
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,221
I'm clean.

550
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,891
Would you accompany me
to the police station?

551
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,947
This way.

552
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,287
It's New Year's Eve.
What were you doing?

553
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,872
Let me have your bag.

554
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,709
I was practicing my act.

555
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:55,755
Ouch.

556
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,560
Thank you.

557
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,897
So, you're a comedian?

558
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,357
Yeah.

559
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,907
It's the New Year's bell.

560
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,870
So...

561
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,832
Do you have any gags?

562
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,669
No, I don't really do gags.

563
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,755
You don't...

564
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,881
Sorry.

565
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,592
So, the year ends...

566
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:51,269
2002 NEW YEAR'S DAY

567
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,871
Shall we?

568
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,086
How long are you praying for?

569
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,129
Hey! Hurry up!

570
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,887
Sorry for the wait.

571
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,477
Two of these, please.

572
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,896
That will be 1,200 yen.

573
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,818
-Can I have a fortune slip, too?
-Certainly. One hundred yen.

574
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,863
Open it.

575
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,866
-How will this year be?
-Here goes.

576
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,621
I got a "Little Lucky."

577
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,837
You won't tie it to a sacred tree?

578
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,881
Today's special. I'm keeping it.

579
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,800
But "Little Lucky" isn't one
you would usually keep.

580
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,804
But isn't "Little Lucky" cute?
It sounds like a boy's name.

581
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,180
"Little Lucky"?

582
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,893
It sounds like a stupid kid
with a runny nose.

583
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,812
Don't say that about my Little Lucky.

584
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,441
Little Lucky has snot all over his face
and he licks the swings.

585
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,360
Little Lucky bangs his dick
on the corner of the sandbox.

586
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,820
Am I right, Tokunaga?

587
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,071
I don't know.

588
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,699
He just laughed at Little Lucky.

589
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,743
-You are so mean!
-I didn't laugh.

590
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,871
Yes, you did.
Apologize to Little Lucky.

591
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,082
-You just like that phrase "Little Lucky."
-Little Lucky.

592
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,877
-Little Lucky.
-I'm not Little Lucky.

593
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,883
-Little Lucky's fly is always open.
-It sure is.

594
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,156
Be careful. You okay?

595
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,454
Ouch!

596
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,872
Are you okay?

597
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,336
Wow.

598
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,880
It looks delicious.

599
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,842
Onion.

600
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,887
Deep-fried tofu.

601
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,889
Mushroom.

602
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,849
Meat.

603
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,768
Minced fish.

604
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,645
And...

605
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,855
Soup.

606
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,737
Eat up!

607
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,364
Don't wait for me.

608
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,908
Okay.

609
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,952
Thanks for this.

610
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,037
Meat.

611
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,879
Soup.

612
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,595
What's wrong?

613
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,558
You don't like kimchi?

614
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,310
Don't force yourself.

615
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,770
Is it too spicy?

616
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,605
It's not that.

617
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,858
-What is it?
-Want some water?

618
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,572
It tastes the same as Mom's.

619
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,913
Don't make it so dramatic!

620
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,211
-But it's different.
-Make up your mind.

621
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,256
It tastes better than Mom's.

622
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,800
You should've said,
"It tastes exactly the same."

623
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,260
Eat up.

624
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,428
Thank you.

625
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,346
Get your glasses ready.

626
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,060
Got them?

627
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,562
Cheers!

628
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,865
Nice try with the flattery,
but all hot pots taste the same.

629
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,872
And it's ready-made.
She got on sale at the supermarket.

630
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,875
Are you okay?

631
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,877
I'm fine. Sorry.

632
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,129
But...

633
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,672
This is...

634
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,009
At first, the kimchi spice gets your nose,

635
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,720
but then the vegetables,
meat and mushrooms make it mild--

636
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,146
Can I give you a hand?

637
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,858
Your job is to eat.

638
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,069
Thanks.

639
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,240
How did your audition go?

640
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,126
Mr. Kamiya is funny.

641
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,555
Maki.

642
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,431
Are the dumplings ready?

643
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,100
Yep. Just a minute.

644
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,019
Can I say one thing?

645
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,146
In my case...

646
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,857
Actually, in Mr. Kamiya's case...

647
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,901
If he can get a laugh,

648
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,488
no matter how violent or lewd it may be,

649
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,907
he's not afraid to say it.

650
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,118
-So?
-That's how you are.

651
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,120
But in my case...

652
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,081
No matter how clear my act's direction is,

653
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,125
if a dirty joke pops up halfway through,

654
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,878
I would give up altogether.

655
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,463
If it's funny, it's funny.

656
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,924
No, I must disagree.

657
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,930
Anyway, that's just me.

658
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,810
That's how my mind works.

659
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,604
Do you understand?

660
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,189
Tokunaga, eat up.

661
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,941
Thank you.

662
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,154
Why are you cross-eyed?

663
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,246
So, I was talking about dirty jokes--

664
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,081
Dumplings!

665
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,090
It's not funny. Really.

666
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,217
If you keep doing them,

667
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,262
even unfunny things start to become funny.

668
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,847
Tokunaga.

669
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,851
It's not funny.

670
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,355
She's not funny? You're starting to laugh.

671
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,774
It's so unfunny.

672
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,400
You're laughing.

673
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,318
Tokunaga.

674
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,158
You're laughing your pants off.

675
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,412
What's she doing?

676
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,213
Are you gonna admit defeat?

677
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,548
Did you lose to my final weapon?

678
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:00,841
I lose.

679
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,179
Rock-paper-scissors!

680
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,224
See that? You've got paper for brains.

681
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,226
Go to the store, paper-brains!

682
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,521
A jumbo chocolate ice cream
and two short Hopes.

683
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,814
-Two it is.
-I'll go.

684
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,733
-No, you're our guest.
-But...

685
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:18,859
I've got it.

686
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,070
-Okay.
-Thanks.

687
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,864
-I'll be back.
-Take care.

688
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,159
Oops, I nearly forgot.

689
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,666
This is a present for you.
Don't forget it.

690
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,669
-You shouldn't have.
-I'll be back.

691
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,341
She's so kind.

692
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,603
I'll go with her.

693
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,777
You didn't have to.

694
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,321
I lost at rock-paper-scissors, too.

695
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:05,906
Thanks.

696
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,664
He's never brought anyone else back.

697
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,711
He always talks about you.

698
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,967
When he's with you, he really looks happy.

699
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,637
Huh?!

700
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,726
You look like
a really poor newlywed couple.

701
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,728
What are you talking about?

702
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,528
I forgot to tell you something.

703
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,239
Happy New Year.

704
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,992
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

705
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,579
I wonder what will happen this year.

706
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,625
It will be a great year.

707
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,504
She knows what to say.

708
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,842
-May it be a great year.
-Make it a great year.

709
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,043
Kamiya's biography - part 2

710
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,754
From New Year's Day, 2002

711
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,438
"Kamiya and Maki"

712
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,650
Today I paid a visit to a shrine
with Kamiya and Maki.
