00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,975
SPARKS' FIRST SOLO LIVE

2
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:34,319
JAN. 22, 2005

3
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,794
He hasn't moved an inch.

4
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:28,844
Is he asleep?

5
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,890
They're done!

6
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:54,938
They look great.

7
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,948
If you need more, let me know.

8
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,534
They're still warm!

9
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,998
And this month's <i>Popolo</i>.

10
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,417
IT'S WINTER

11
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,924
Isshin Takada, the writer,
mentioned you in his column.

12
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,302
-He did?!
-Who?

13
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:11,763
Here.

14
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,183
See?

15
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:16,063
THE 10 YOUNG COMEDIANS
YOU NEED TO KNOW

16
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:18,067
8TH - SPARKS

17
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,946
"Tokunaga is the unique funny man.

18
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,161
Yamashita is the charismatic straight man
and together, they truly 'Spark.'"

19
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,121
It's us!

20
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,958
Have you heard about the jinx?

21
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,672
Everyone mentioned in this column
hits the big time.

22
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,050
Is there such a jinx?

23
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,596
I know him! Mr. Takada...

24
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,851
-I know Takada!
-No, you don't.

25
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:37,982
Nice reaction from
"the charismatic straight man."

26
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,406
I'm not the...

27
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:45,706
Yeah.

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,255
So, we'll make it?
We'll go to the top?

29
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,219
Why not? You could go all the way.

30
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,768
-The top? I have no idea.
-You have no idea?

31
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:59,149
But after all, Sparks is
our agency's number-one act.

32
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:03,324
The flyers for Buu Fubuubu's solo show
finally arrived, boss!

33
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,044
These look fantastic!

34
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:13,344
We had trouble making this
fluorescent color come out right.

35
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:17,937
But our agency's number one act
deserves the brightest there is.

36
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:21,861
Perfect!

37
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,949
BUU FUBUUBU'S SOLO SHOW

38
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,118
How vivid!

39
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,088
Listen, boys.

40
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,804
You shouldn't compare your work
to that of others.

41
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,643
Are you better than you were yesterday?

42
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,605
Will you be better again tomorrow?

43
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:40,607
That's all.

44
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,070
Wisdom from the god of porn, Taka Kato.

45
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,536
He said it.

46
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,713
How powerful!

47
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,850
How blatant.

48
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:02,067
In that <i>Popolo</i> magazine,
Buu Fubuubu ranked 4th.

49
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,908
"You're our agency's number one act"?!

50
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,454
How many number one acts
do agencies have?

51
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,957
Everyone's number one.

52
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,087
Sorry.

53
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:19,226
I think black and white is cooler anyway.

54
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,272
It just costs less.

55
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,904
Fellini's <i>La Strada.</i>

56
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:28,035
Godard's <i>Breathless.</i>

57
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,664
They were black and white, too.

58
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,041
What's that?

59
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,004
Pandas...

60
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:34,841
<i>Othello...</i>

61
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:39,016
Photos of the deceased, too.
All popular things are black and white.

62
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:41,145
Photos of the deceased?
Like at a funeral?

63
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,815
They're not "popular."

64
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:47,908
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY

65
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,787
EVERYONE ENDS UP BLACK AND WHITE

66
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:50,956
Stop doing that.

67
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,002
And they use color photos
at funerals nowadays.

68
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,254
So what?

69
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,676
We're doing our first solo show.

70
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:00,266
Our next one is definitely
going to be color!

71
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,396
What is this?!

72
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,988
I wouldn't really do it.

73
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:12,040
-You're good.
-I was on the team.

74
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,251
What team?

75
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:29,992
Two pork dumplings.

76
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,746
Two pork dumplings to go.

77
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,708
That's 560 yen.

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,128
I've got it.

79
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,716
Stop trying to use small change
whenever you can.

80
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,511
Here's 10,000 yen.

81
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:53,367
HIBANA
- Spark -

82
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,564
Wanna call it quits?

83
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,403
This place reeks too much of dumplings.

84
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:12,864
It does.

85
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:46,974
What a cute baby.

86
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,107
Hear that? The man said you're cute.

87
00:07:56,284 --> 00:08:01,044
<i>Upon the nun's right eye</i>
<i>rest two flies.</i>

88
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:09,853
<i>Upon the gravestone of the man</i>
<i>I owe my life rest two flies.</i>

89
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,609
-Sorry?
-Mr. Kamiya, what's that?

90
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,615
I thought up a series of
"fly haiku" yesterday.

91
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:17,702
That won't stop the baby crying.

92
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:20,583
Your child sure is full of life.

93
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:28,808
<i>The antipode of a fly is a Parisian.</i>

94
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:36,156
<i>I'm a fly. You're a cricket.</i>
<i>That's the sea.</i>

95
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,826
It's scared of you now.

96
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:46,218
<i>The melon your mother got</i>
<i>as a souvenir is covered with flies.</i>

97
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:48,931
Could you stop it?

98
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:52,146
Mr. Kamiya,
babies don't laugh at "fly haiku."

99
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,025
Then you make it laugh.

100
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:56,613
Look, the mother's in trouble. Poor lady.

101
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,341
Peek a... boo!

102
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,520
Peek a...

103
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:13,773
Boo!

104
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,610
Boo!

105
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,950
Shall we? Sorry. We have to...

106
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,624
Kano! Let's go for a walk. Come on.
We can do it.

107
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,294
We're going.

108
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:25,797
Okay. Let's go!

109
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:31,767
Thank you.

110
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:41,620
"I'm gonna fill our pockets with dreams
and take us to the top."

111
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:44,250
"Camels and gorillas will laugh, too!"
How lame!

112
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,131
That's lame.
This is how you make a threat:

113
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:50,053
I'll slap you with the back of my hand
and say, "I've had enough!"

114
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,849
-Are you threatening me?
-I've had enough.

115
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,393
Thank you.

116
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,944
"Camels and gorillas" won't work.

117
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,366
But, yeah... Think of something.

118
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:03,205
I thought it was good.

119
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,545
I don't get it.

120
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:18,485
And your reactions, they're...

121
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,076
-They're rigid.
-"Rigid"?

122
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,833
Try keeping it down at the start
and building it up at the end.

123
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,471
Okay. At the start, I'll keep it down.

124
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,267
And at the end...

125
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,481
I'll focus on being stronger.

126
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:42,116
-You haven't changed from day one.
-It's bugged you from the start?

127
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,998
It's been annoying you that long?
Why didn't you tell me?

128
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,879
-From the first time we spoke...
-From the first time we spoke?!

129
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:51,718
-I thought, "He's rigid."
-I don't remember a thing.

130
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,096
I have no recollection at all.

131
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:56,770
-I don't remember the first time we met.
-You don't?

132
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,360
You thought I was rigid back then?

133
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,241
You thought, "He's rigid"?

134
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:06,957
Tell me. From now on.
Anything else?

135
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,543
I think that's all.

136
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:21,903
Will our show be a success?

137
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,619
We've put in enough effort.

138
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:29,210
Maybe we should go pray at a shrine.

139
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,629
No way.

140
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:19,351
FORTUNE STICKS

141
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,904
Hello.

142
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,622
-Can I have one try?
-That will be 100 yen.

143
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:36,177
Thank you.

144
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,726
Please pull your fortune stick.

145
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:53,712
OVERALL RATING
"LITTLE LUCKY"

146
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:56,885
"Little Lucky"?

147
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,098
It's not what you think.

148
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:21,684
Sorry?

149
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,273
I mean, it's not what you think.

150
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:26,319
What's wrong?

151
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:32,706
I'm collecting my stuff from Maki's place.
I want you to come with me.

152
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,712
Of course I will...

153
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:38,176
Did you have a fight?

154
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:41,641
Maki got herself a boyfriend.

155
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:46,651
Are you kidding?

156
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,909
Shocked me, too.

157
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,418
I told you she was working at
a hostess bar in Kichijoji, right?

158
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,130
Yes?

159
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:58,884
Well...

160
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:01,556
Apparently it was a brothel.

161
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,607
When she first arrived in Tokyo,
a guy came up to her.

162
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,279
He said he was recruiting girls
for a hostess bar.

163
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:12,369
When she went to the interview...

164
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:19,007
It was for a brothel with a gimmick:
The girls dress up as ghosts.

165
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,387
You know how she can't say, "No."

166
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,940
"I dressed up as a ghost for my clients."

167
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,777
Did she have to be so specific?

168
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:31,282
I can imagine all the finer details.

169
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,252
I know this will sound selfish, but...

170
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,174
my heart hurts.

171
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,681
Maybe I liked her.

172
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,320
Maybe I really liked her.

173
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:04,640
It's the Tokunaga Family!
Is this your house?

174
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,731
Ring the bell? Don't think so!

175
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,175
I thought it was an ambulance,
but it's a cop car!

176
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,638
A cop car!

177
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,559
<i>Compared to his usual self...</i>

178
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:29,356
<i>Mr. Kamiya was unbelievably...</i>

179
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:32,278
<i>unfunny.</i>

180
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:33,740
A cop car!

181
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,203
Tokunaga...

182
00:15:58,372 --> 00:15:59,583
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,629
What is it?

184
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm...

185
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm too scared to go in.

186
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:13,152
Shall I go in by myself?

187
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,657
But if you complain later, I'll kill you.

188
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,875
No...

189
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:22,921
I'll go with you.

190
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:28,724
And no matter what the guy says...

191
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,814
I'll stay silent. That's best for her.

192
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,532
But...

193
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:40,707
I don't want to feel sad or miserable.

194
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,339
I'm sorry, but...

195
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,431
when we're inside, I need a favor.

196
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,773
A favor?

197
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,820
I want you...

198
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,457
I want you to have a boner.

199
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,838
A boner?

200
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:10,683
If I start to lose it,
I'll look at your crotch.

201
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:16,153
Even though your mentor's going
through hell, you'll have a boner.

202
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:19,117
That's funny, and it'll help me stay sane.

203
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,045
Isn't that a bit risky for me?

204
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,012
If the guy notices,
won't he come up and punch me?

205
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:32,769
That's a unique reason to be punched.

206
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:36,360
If he leaves a scar, you'll enjoy
telling people how you got it.

207
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:37,779
No, I won't.

208
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:42,246
This isn't the best time to remind you,
but I don't like dirty jokes.

209
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,376
Please.

210
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:48,091
It's all up to your crotch.

211
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,444
Give me a minute.

212
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,959
It's not downloading.

213
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:25,035
Come on.

214
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,773
Oh, Tokunaga.

215
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,652
Thanks for coming.

216
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,996
-Excuse me.
-Come in.

217
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,012
I'm sorry. Really.

218
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,059
I'll get you some tea.

219
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:21,773
Don't bother. We won't be long.

220
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,109
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,113
I haven't...

222
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:49,495
I haven't found a place yet.

223
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,292
I can't take everything today.

224
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,674
It's okay. There's no rush.

225
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,847
I'm really sorry.

226
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,686
I've got a show tomorrow.

227
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,653
I just need my <i>manzai</i> outfit
and a change of clothes.

228
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:10,203
Tokunaga.

229
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,166
Take this bag.

230
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:15,046
Put those things in it.

231
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,154
Tokunaga.

232
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,413
Sorry.

233
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,182
Tokunaga.

234
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,188
Tokunaga!

235
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:07,109
Hey!

236
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,154
Those, too!

237
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,180
I don't need that.

238
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:26,147
<i>The night Shigeta was killed,</i>
<i>Matsushima was in Okayama.</i>

239
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,526
<i>Don't do it.</i>

240
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:31,365
<i>Don't do it! Stop!</i>

241
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:57,287
So, I'm out.

242
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,082
Sorry for intruding.

243
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,170
Sorry for everything. Thanks.

244
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:07,015
What's with that?

245
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:11,357
Take care of yourself.

246
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:14,446
Tokunaga, too.

247
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:19,540
I've had enough.

248
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,482
Shall we?

249
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:10,224
Hey.

250
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,855
Why are you crying with a boner?

251
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:14,525
I'm not.

252
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:16,946
You're like a baby that's horny.

253
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:19,618
You told me to.

254
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,386
I saw you.

255
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:31,684
Back in Maki's room, I caught you.

256
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:34,648
You played with your dick.
That's cheating.

257
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:38,364
Under those circumstances,
it was the only way.

258
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,446
You know what?

259
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,408
Yes?

260
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:25,917
There's a guy over there
drinking by himself.

261
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,879
There is.

262
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:32,221
He looks like he's never
had a reason to smile.

263
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:37,440
Nothing good has happened to him
since the day he was born.

264
00:26:40,446 --> 00:26:42,200
He does?

265
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,621
No doubt about it.

266
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,544
You're right.

267
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:53,180
But I wonder.

268
00:26:53,973 --> 00:26:55,852
What would he do?

269
00:26:57,104 --> 00:27:01,530
How would he look
if someone paid his bill for him?

270
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:27,582
For that guy's tiny bit of happiness,

271
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,669
we're putting up with a lot of cold.

272
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:34,345
I see that guy every now and then.

273
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,437
He always drinks three highballs,
and that's it.

274
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:40,733
You notice things like that?

275
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:43,864
When he realizes tonight's for free,

276
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:46,870
his face will probably light up,

277
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:50,377
just like when she lights a match
in "The Little Match Girl."

278
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,049
Why do we have to pay for
something like that?

279
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,389
And at the end of
"The Little Match Girl," she dies.

280
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,521
It sure is cold.

281
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:02,485
Warm my hand.

282
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:05,533
-What's this?
-My dick.

283
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,036
-What is it?
-My dick!

284
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:09,207
-What is it?
-How old are you?

285
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:11,085
-It's warm.
-Leave it alone.

286
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,296
It's warm.

287
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:44,068
That guy!

288
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:45,696
See him?

289
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:47,575
He went:

290
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:49,621
Like this.

291
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,674
What's so funny?

292
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,432
Who does that?

293
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:00,559
I'm cold.

294
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:02,438
Let's go.

295
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,589
Tokunaga!

296
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:20,558
You're drunk. Come to my place.

297
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:21,685
Okay?

298
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:24,148
Come!

299
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:35,629
Your place?

300
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,510
Where's that?

301
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:40,639
I don't feel good.

302
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:46,317
Where are you going?!

303
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:59,385
That's right.

304
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:09,322
I forgot.

305
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:42,174
SEIWASOU APARTMENTS

306
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:49,605
You scared me.

307
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,424
Are you okay?

308
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,856
Are you throwing them away?

309
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:13,778
The landlord is.

310
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,751
How mean.

311
00:32:30,771 --> 00:32:31,856
Let's put them back.

312
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:38,494
You'll help me?

313
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:39,705
Yes.

314
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:40,958
Thanks.

315
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:53,566
This one's heavy.

316
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,779
What is this?

317
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,163
It's the latest phonograph.

Please fill out the review.

322
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,486
It's time to go on.

323
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:58,738
Thank you.

324
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,366
Shall we?

325
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:14,854
Hello!

326
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:15,856
Hello.

327
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,693
Hello!

328
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,575
-Thank you.
-We're Sparks.

329
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:23,663
-Please enjoy the show.
-Please enjoy the show.

330
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:25,876
-We're lucky.
-We sure are.

331
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:29,049
So many people came.
What a pleasant surprise.

332
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:32,848
-It's our solo show.
-We can see every single person's face.

333
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:37,106
So, thanks to the familiar faces,
and the not-so-familiar faces.

334
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,862
-We're grateful.
-It's our first ever solo show.

335
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:41,448
And it's a packed house.

336
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,951
-We appreciate it.
-How true.

337
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:45,957
-We couldn't have made it without you.
-Definitely.

338
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,753
Thank you all so much.

339
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,761
You're going nuts.

340
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:55,894
Who'd pay 2,000 yen
to be thanked six times?

341
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,399
-You're scary. Stop it.
-You're right.

342
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,486
-We've got an hour to go.
-We do.

343
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:01,906
-Enjoy the show.
-Enjoy the show.

344
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:02,950
Isn't this sign cool?

345
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:04,661
-Just for us.
-It is.

346
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:05,956
"Sparks' Solo Show."

347
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,962
The name of a solo show
is really important.

348
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:10,465
It sure is.

349
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:14,264
-You'll realize when you hold your own.
-They won't hold one.

350
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:16,685
Has anyone in your family
done a solo show before?

351
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:19,065
Nobody in mine has.
They probably won't either.

352
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:22,489
We came up with this title
thanks to a little miracle.

353
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,284
-We did?
-Yeah.

354
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:25,996
A miracle?

355
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:28,250
We were thinking about a title
when I said,

356
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,755
"Let's say the first thing
that comes to mind."

357
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,010
-This is what popped out.
-No, it didn't.

358
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,055
That'd be too much of a miracle.

359
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:37,644
"Let's say the first thing
that comes to mind. Ready?"

360
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,022
-"Throw Sparks."
-"Throw Sparks."

361
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:41,735
I don't think so. That'd be too amazing.

362
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:43,948
We'd be on TV just for that.

363
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:47,079
They'd come from the U.S. to interview us.
There was no miracle.

364
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,250
-That didn't happen?
-No. Stop lying.

365
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,129
Well, you know how it goes.

366
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:54,010
-We never thought we'd do a solo show.
-We didn't.

367
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,972
Honestly. This is a big deal.

368
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:59,103
-Our agency sucks.
-Cut it out. The staff is watching.

369
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,026
-Our agency really sucks.
-They're right there.

370
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:05,115
I'll never forget the first time
we went to the office.

371
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:08,414
They had the company motto on the wall.
It's hung up.

372
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:11,587
It's just like this title.
Written in calligraphy.

373
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,841
-Guess what it said.
-In big letters.

374
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,840
-"We can't help you."
-He's right.

375
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,100
Who can help us?

376
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:19,185
-They suck.
-They suck.

377
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:22,024
When an agency sucks,
its employees suck, too.

378
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:24,195
Cut it out. I told you they're here.

379
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,992
-They're all here.
-One of them is in charge of us.

380
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:29,915
-He's really dangerous.
-He's called Mr. Ogata.

381
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,501
Oops, I let his name slip out.

382
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:34,090
-Mr. Ogata is dangerous.
-You shouldn't call people that.

383
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:36,971
On top of Mr. Ogata's desk was...

384
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:38,599
In fact, there still is.

385
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,728
There's a mountain of X-rated videos.

386
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:43,484
He's got as many as a student
during puberty.

387
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:46,740
-How are we supposed to react?
-It's a difficult situation.

388
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:50,038
And sometimes he gives us
feedback on our <i>manzai</i>.

389
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:52,627
He gives us a bit of advice.

390
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,967
But he always includes a quote
from a porn actor.

391
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:57,303
He does.

392
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,810
How are we supposed to react to
allegories about the female body?

393
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,730
I prayed someone would reprimand him.

394
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:06,571
-Then his female colleague spoke up.
-She opened her mouth for us.

395
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:08,993
-"How powerful!"
-She liked the quote?

396
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,830
She's on his side?

397
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:14,337
-It's a miracle this show even happened.
-Considering the circumstances.

398
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:16,842
So, please bear with us
for the next hour or so.

399
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,220
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the show.

400
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:20,558
-Let's get it rolling!
-Here we go.

401
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:22,061
So, there's this--

402
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,315
I wanna eat curry.

403
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,236
There's--

404
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,114
I really want some curry.

405
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:29,158
I had this--

406
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,162
-I wanna eat curry!
-What's up?!

407
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:34,502
Enough with the curry comments.
That's "curry harassment."

408
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,381
-I want to eat curry.
-It's annoying!

409
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,803
-I was saying--
-You don't get it.

410
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,767
When I left home today
for our big solo show,

411
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:43,896
I smelled curry from the house next door.

412
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:46,735
That put me in the mood.
I've wanted curry ever since.

413
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,113
Who cares?!

414
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:52,204
Just because you smelled curry
doesn't mean you can talk about it now.

415
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:55,795
-Don't we always do curry <i>manzai?</i>
-We've never done curry <i>manzai.</i>

416
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,843
-We always wear turbans and do curry.
-We've never done that!

417
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,475
"Wear turbans and do curry"?
We've never worn turbans and done curry.

418
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:05,397
We could wear turbans and do <i>manzai</i>,
but we never have.

419
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:08,195
But wearing turbans and <i>doing </i>curry?
How do you <i>do </i>curry?

420
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:12,036
-Today I want to do <i>manzai</i> for curry.
-For curry? No way.

421
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:14,457
-I wanna do <i>manzai</i> for our audience.
-Let's do it.

422
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:16,545
-Concentrate, please.
-I am.

423
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,843
-All you're talking about is curry.
-I shouldn't talk about curry?

424
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,139
-Your head's full of curry.
-You're right.

425
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:23,141
-Stop it.
-Okay.

426
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:24,936
-Forget about curry.
-Forget about curry!

427
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,441
To be honest, I love it indoors.

428
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,362
I don't go out that much.

429
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:31,074
I'm an indoor-phile.

430
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,453
But the other day,
I went on a trip--

431
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,960
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Tell you I went out?

432
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,465
I thought you preferred
the U.S. or Europe.

433
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:42,179
-What are you talking about?
-I'm an Indophile, too.

434
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:44,183
Indophile. India.

435
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:46,271
-I wanna eat curry!
-I said, "Indoor-phile."

436
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,483
I said I love the indoors,
not India.

437
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,571
-Quit the curry talk.
-Sorry.

438
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:53,159
-So, I went to a hot spring.
-I love hot springs.

439
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:56,207
I love the food at hot springs.
Did you eat soft-boiled eggs?

440
00:38:56,374 --> 00:38:57,209
I did.

441
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,756
They taste best in curry.
It becomes so mellow.

442
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:02,136
-I want to eat curry!
-Enough with the curry.

443
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,764
What's with you?

444
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:07,104
Are you trying my patience?
Be careful. I have none.

445
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,275
"None"?
Did you just say "None?"

446
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,197
-Like curry's best friend, "naan"?
-Stop it.

447
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:13,784
Enough with the curry.

448
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:14,953
Idiot!

449
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:16,665
Idiot!

450
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,168
-Idiot!
-I'm here!

451
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:20,339
-Idiot!
-I'm here!

452
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:21,758
-Idiot!
-I'm here!

453
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:23,553
-I'm here!
-I didn't call you yet.

454
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,225
I have to say "idiot" for you to say,
"I'm here!"

455
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:27,687
Cut it out.

456
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:29,732
-Cut out the curry.
-I have to forget it.

457
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:32,822
-Please. Get it out of your system.
-Good idea.

458
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,659
Curry!

459
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:35,953
Okay?

460
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:38,834
-I want it more than ever.
-You do?

461
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:41,005
-Curry!
-You sure do.

462
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,595
-Curry!
-Just get it out.

463
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:46,599
-Curry!
-Okay?

464
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:49,021
-Maybe you should eat some.
-Good idea.

465
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,943
-Here you go.
-Thanks. Bon appetit!

466
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:53,655
You use chopsticks?

467
00:39:54,073 --> 00:39:56,536
You eat curry with chopsticks?
Stop it.

468
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:58,164
-No more curry.
-It's gone.

469
00:39:58,248 --> 00:39:59,291
-Really?
-Positive.

470
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:02,548
If you say "curry" again, I'll hit you.

471
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:05,220
-No more.
-Sure.

472
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,890
-No more.
-I swear.

473
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,226
-Got it?
-Yep.

474
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,522
So, I stayed overnight
at a hot springs resort--

475
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:13,779
When you leave curry overnight,
it gets even tastier.

476
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:14,906
I wanna eat curry!

477
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:18,288
You're leaking.

478
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,083
You're leaking curry.

479
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,753
-I said something?
-You did.

480
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,051
You don't remember?!
You said, "I wanna eat curry!"

481
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:26,512
About six seconds ago.

482
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,514
Stop it!

483
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:31,773
I was in bed, but something felt wrong.
I was so scared. I wished Mom was--

484
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:34,528
Mom? Mom's curry?
It's simple, but delicious.

485
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:35,447
I wanna eat curry!

486
00:40:35,697 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm gonna ignore you.

487
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:39,831
I'll ignore every word you say.

488
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:41,083
Stop it.

489
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,298
I felt someone looking at me
from the window.

490
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,803
When I looked closer,
I saw a woman covered in blood.

491
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,809
Blood? Blood is red.
Just like curry relish. I wanna eat curry!

492
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:51,061
Cut it out!

493
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,276
All you talk about is curry!
You are so goddamn persistent.

494
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:56,906
Goddamn? Goddamn. Garam masala.
I wanna eat curry!

495
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:59,620
"Goddamn" and "Garam masala"
are not even close!

496
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:01,207
Not even close.

497
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:02,334
Chai!
I wanna eat curry!

498
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,547
That was a powerful "Chai!"

499
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,175
"Chai!"? What's with you?!

500
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,262
Give me a reason for all this curry talk!

501
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,684
Reason? There's none. Naan.
I wanna eat curry!

502
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,439
-I don't mean "naan."
-Naan. I wanna eat curry!

503
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,443
-I said, "None!"
-"None?" Naan!

504
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,115
Naan is curry's best friend.
I wanna eat curry!

505
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:21,288
Sorry. I made a mistake.
This is all my fault.

506
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:23,292
It's your mistake. Miss Universe.

507
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:25,046
Miss Universes are slim.

508
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,511
Slim people have good metabolism.
What boosts your metabolism? Curry.

509
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:30,766
-I wanna eat curry!
-What a detour!

510
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:33,229
You went a long way
to arrive at "curry" there.

511
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:36,360
You could probably link
anything to curry. Right?

512
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:38,949
-"A 500 yen coin"!
-A 500 yen coin is silver.

513
00:41:39,074 --> 00:41:41,579
Spoons are silver. You eat curry
with spoons. I wanna eat curry!

514
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:44,209
You're amazing! Or can anyone do this?

515
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,547
-Why don't you try?
-Give me a word.

516
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:49,720
"Audience."

517
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:52,309
The audience wears smiles.
Smiles mean happiness.

518
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:54,772
What causes happiness?
The sun when it shines.

519
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:57,945
Shining suns are round.
What else is round? The moon.

520
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:00,868
What is the moon? It's perfectly round.

521
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,997
What's perfectly round? Glasses!

522
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,418
What is this?! It's difficult as hell!

523
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,047
-You were pathetic.
-You're amazing.

524
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:08,466
-"Lemon!"
-Lemons are yellow.

525
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,096
-Curry is yellow. I wanna eat curry!
-You're amazing!

526
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:13,059
-"Sunflower!"
-Sunflowers are yellow.

527
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:14,729
Curry is yellow.
I wanna eat curry!

528
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:16,524
-"Traffic lights!"
-Traffic lights are red.

529
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:19,906
-Curry relish is red. I wanna eat curry.
-He can do red, too.

530
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,413
It works for yellow and red.
Let me try again.

531
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:27,045
-I'll give you an easy one.
-Thanks. Easy ones exist?

532
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,633
-"Space station."
-Are space stations easy?

533
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:31,596
Space stations are easy?

534
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:35,645
Space stations are close to the moon.
The moon is round. What's round? Glasses.

535
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:37,232
Why do I end up at "glasses"?!

536
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:40,154
-Tell me why.
-You're in a glasses loop.

537
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,701
-"Glasses!"
-Glasses are yellow. Curry is yellow.

538
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,290
-I wanna eat curry!
-Not all glasses are yellow.

539
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:47,795
Glasses aren't necessarily yellow.

540
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:49,381
What is this? "Coffee"!

541
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:50,926
Coffee is brown.
Curry's brown.

542
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:53,431
-I wanna eat curry.
-Wow. You could be on TV--

543
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:55,435
What are we talking about?!

544
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:59,276
I want to tell the scary story
from the hot spring resort.

545
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:03,159
The audience didn't come to hear
your "curry-association" skills.

546
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:06,457
That's it. I'm moving on.
I'll keep my stories to myself.

547
00:43:06,624 --> 00:43:08,837
I'll tell them to my real friends.

548
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:12,344
I'll never share my private life again.
I'm moving on.

549
00:43:12,427 --> 00:43:14,932
-Stop saying that.
-Saying what?

550
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:16,393
That you're
"Moo-ving on."

551
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:18,648
What goes "moo"? Cows.
Cows make beef.

552
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:20,610
-The best beef dish is?
-Beef curry.

553
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:23,199
-I wanna eat beef stroganoff.
-Not curry?

554
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:24,159
-I've had enough.
-Thank you.

555
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,807
The girl who wrote this review
really likes you.

556
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:36,726
Read it out.

557
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,191
"Toku-chan is hot.
His silver hair is the best!"

558
00:43:40,274 --> 00:43:41,109
Who cares?

559
00:43:41,193 --> 00:43:43,364
"Toku-chan is cute. I wanna date him."

560
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,535
-So what?
-"Occupation: Dental Assistant."

561
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:47,330
"Age: 28 years old."

562
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:50,420
Her phone number's here, too.
She sounds nasty.

563
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,056
Let go.

564
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:58,686
-Don't sleep with the audience.
-I never would.

565
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:00,815
What's with this one?

566
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:04,072
"The tempo was good,
but the setup was poor.

567
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:07,662
-The first joke was weak."
-That guy always comes.

568
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:09,833
-"The structure is simple."
-Good job, guys.

569
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:11,879
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

570
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:14,802
Well done.

571
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,474
-You did well.
-Thank you.

572
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:20,062
You're better than you were before.

573
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:22,358
To be honest, we can tell.

574
00:44:22,484 --> 00:44:23,527
Thank you.

575
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:27,201
And...
Should I tell you?

576
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:30,333
-Tell us what?
-I've got a bit of good news.

577
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,710
What is it?

578
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,050
-Maybe I shouldn't.
-Tell us. What is it?

579
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:36,553
Well, actually...

580
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,062
You're gonna do a two-minute act
on Mr. Miyata's late night radio show.

581
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:43,693
Late night radio?

582
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:45,655
Are you serious?

583
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:48,327
Mr. Miyata...

584
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:50,122
That show's really funny.

585
00:44:50,665 --> 00:44:52,544
I remember you talking about it.

586
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:55,550
I've got to write an act. Thank you!

587
00:44:56,051 --> 00:44:59,307
-I'm probably gonna die tomorrow.
-Be careful.

588
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,645
I'm coming in.

589
00:45:01,937 --> 00:45:03,482
Good job, guys.

590
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:05,277
Excuse me.

591
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:06,655
Thank you for coming.

592
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:12,959
Let me introduce you.
This is the writer, Mr. Isshin Takada.

593
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,214
Hi. I'm Takada.

594
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,218
I'm Sparks' Tokunaga.

595
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:18,554
I'm Yamashita.

596
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:23,146
-From <i>Popolo!</i>
-Don't point.

597
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:25,401
From <i>Popolo!</i>

598
00:45:27,906 --> 00:45:28,991
What a surprise.

599
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:31,496
Thank you for mentioning us.

600
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,041
"I wanna eat curry!"

601
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:35,421
He's doing our act.

602
00:45:36,089 --> 00:45:40,264
INCOMING CALL:
SAIZOU KAMIYA

603
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:51,870
Excuse me.

604
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:53,582
Welcome.

605
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:02,726
-Beer.
-Coming up.

606
00:46:19,384 --> 00:46:20,595
Mr. Kamiya?

607
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:25,980
Master!

608
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,627
You're here.

609
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,299
You're asleep.

610
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:41,637
I only just got here.

611
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,643
Your eyes are only half open.

612
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,440
Nope.

613
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,738
-Beer, please.
-I already ordered.

614
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:52,366
Here you go.

615
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:55,164
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

616
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:08,106
You wanna...

617
00:47:12,615 --> 00:47:15,454
I'll have the beef tendon stew.

618
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:35,703
<i>Here's your Oolong & Shochu.</i>

619
00:47:37,832 --> 00:47:40,003
<i>And your Lemon Sour.</i>

620
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:42,717
<i>Please enjoy your evening.</i>

621
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:48,604
<i>Humans are just la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la</i>

622
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:53,614
<i>Humans are just la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la</i>

623
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:58,707
<i>Humans are just la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la</i>

624
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,506
<i>Humans are just la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la</i>

625
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:12,735
I saw the whole thing.

626
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:20,709
<i>Humans are just la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la</i>

627
00:48:21,795 --> 00:48:22,880
Give me more!

628
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:24,801
Give me more, Tokunaga!

629
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:25,845
More!

630
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:30,187
<i>Humans are just la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la</i>

631
00:48:30,312 --> 00:48:31,481
Give me more!

632
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,819
Send it to my soul!

633
00:48:33,986 --> 00:48:36,407
Make it reach my soul!
From yours to mine!

634
00:48:37,368 --> 00:48:38,662
<i>Back then...</i>

635
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,417
<i>we were a little insane.</i>

636
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:51,980
The gateway for soon-to-be
up-and-coming comedians!

637
00:49:15,903 --> 00:49:19,243
The gateway for soon-to-be
up-and-coming comedians!
