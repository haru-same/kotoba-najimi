-Let's go to one more bar.
-I can't.

2
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,152
One more bar.

00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,573

00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:33,867
Thank you.

00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:34,952
No.

6
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,079
It was nothing.

00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,262
I'M THINKING OF
CHANGING THE LAST PUNCHLINE

10
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,224
I'LL BE THERE SOON

11
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,691
Ready...

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,942
Go!

13
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,790
This is killing me.

Why's he so late?

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,556
He's the one that wanted to practice
before the show. What's he doing?

17
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,608
What is it?

18
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,735
Smash!

19
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,870
Both colors look good.

20
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,496
-That's cool, too.
-It is.

21
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,332
Okay. That's it.

22
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,916
As for me...

23
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,795
Red looks cool, too.

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,963
This one and...

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,923
<i>Mr. Kamiya...</i>

26
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,510
<i>It was like he couldn't stop</i>
<i>punishing himself.</i>

27
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,013
Take both of them.

28
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,556
Thank you.

29
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,267
-I'll pay for mine.
-I don't need your money.

00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,019
Sir, do you need this?

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,361
<i>He was like that</i>

32

-What's he doing?!

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,580
-Hello.
-Hold it.

34
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,374
I don't think you work here.

35
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,919
Showing me the inside of your coat
won't help.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,089
-Who are you?
-I'm Yamashita.

37
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,883
That's not much help.
Which "Yamashita" are you?

38
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,051
The straight man.

39
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,011
-Once more.
-Here I go.

40
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,809
-You're worse than I thought.
-Ready?

41
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,271
-Come on.
-You're throwing the ball.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,856
-That's not a serve.
-Hit it back.

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,858
I can't tell when it'll come.

44
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,527
Once more.

45
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,905
-Hit it back properly.
-Let me serve.

46
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,198
Here I go.

47
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,826
Come on!

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,916
You hit the ceiling!

Mr. Hoshikawa, thanks for
having us on <i>Talk-iino.</i>

00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,872
-Don't let me down.
-Thank you!

62
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,165
Introduce yourself.

63
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,918
-I'm Yamashita from Sparks.
-I'm Sakamoto.

64
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,670
This guy's a real pro.

65
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,881
-He's the guru?
-He is.

66
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,634
-Wow.
-This is your big chance.

67
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,010
It's our big chance?

68
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,930
Where's your partner? Tokunaga.

69
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,349
He's, um...

70
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,894
The nerves have got to his stomach.
He's stuck on the toilet.

71
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,898
Don't you get sick of shadow boxing?

72
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,529
I'll be right back.

73
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,489

00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,787
You have plans?

77
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,330
Sorry.

78
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,503
You're right.

79
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,672
Let's call it a night.

80
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,927
-Just one more drink?
-It's okay.

81
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,182
Ready...

82
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,064
Ready!

83
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,901
See ya!

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,286
Speak up!

85
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,579
Yessir! Sorry!

86
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,081
We'll be on soon!
Could you please standby?

87
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,624
Okay.

00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,180
"There's a guy at school
who always plays weird tricks on me.

89

How can I stop it without offending him?
In need of some advice."

90
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,438
So, they're in a bit of trouble.
I guess in situations like these...

91
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,065
Excuse me.
You'll be on soon.

92
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,360
You'll be on soon. It's time to standby!

93
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,987
Sure thing. Thanks.

94
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,240
-Where is your partner?
-My partner... Hm?

95
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,201
It's still warm. He should be close by.

Hurry up and get changed.

There's a lady behind you.

-I got you one, too.
-I'm not wearing it.

Why put on a silly costume
for a radio show?

00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,540
You really do have one for me?
I'm not wearing it!

Where were you?

107
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,294
I was thinking of a new punchline.

108
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,964
-But let's keep the original.
-What?

109
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,590
I nearly had a heart attack--

110
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,053
Blow for me.

111
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,972
Blow!

112
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,348
That's inhaling!

113
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,975
You stink of alcohol!

114

-Hello.

119
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,987
Can you shorten your two-minute act

00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,364
-Thirty seconds?
-We're running over time.

00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,865
-Two minutes...
-Sorry.

122
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,034

Mr. Tokuma won't stand out.

147
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,620
But, boss, it won't fit.
You can't hang it sideways.

148
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,331
How about...? Oh, that won't work either.

-You're right.

-Good morning.

Mr. Ogata...

152
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,008
Let me apologize about the radio show.

153
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,011
But we had to cut it to 30 seconds,
just before the show.

154
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,888
We'd practiced a two-minute routine.

155
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,933
-They told us at the last moment.
-It was a bit unfair.

156
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,977
What are you babbling about?

157
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,147
You got a gig.

158
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,899
The <i>New Comedy Star Battle</i>.

159
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,903
Give me one.

160
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,613
-For real?
-For real?!

161
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,284
-The <i>New Comedy Star Battle</i>!
-I know.

162
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,618
Is this real?

163
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,871
Everyone in the industry comes.

164
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,874
For better or worse, they'll remember you.

165
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,167
They will...

166
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,920
Buu Fubuubu were in this contest
last year, right?

167
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,173
The moment they won,
they got three weekly shows.

168
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
Three weekly shows?

169
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,552
This is insane.

170
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,554
That's <i>if</i> we win.

171
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,891
If you do well,
the <i>New Star Battle </i>is a big chance.

172
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,059
But if you mess up,
the damage is big, too.

173
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,561
Damage?

174
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,771
According to Buu Fubuubu,

175
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,232
it's all about
how much the audience laugh.

176
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,570
It's not like your previous gigs.

177
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,030
Keep the masses in mind.

178
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,115
Why not make your routine simpler?

179
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,164
"It's important that you realize
what people want from you.

00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,876
Not only when you have sex,
but in every situation."

181
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,962
Wisdom from the god of porn, Taka Kato.

182
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,422
Bye.

183
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,924
Okay!

184
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,098
You got in thanks to the recommendation
from the writer, Isshin Takada.

185
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,894
Do it like you always do.

186
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,812
See?

187
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,481
GO WITH THE FLOW

188
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,815
Go for it.

189
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,949
It's the <i>New Star Battle.</i>
What'll we do?

190
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,951
I'm thinking.
Don't rush me.

191
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,869
You heard Mr. Ogata.

192
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,746
"Keep the masses in mind."

193
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,915
It's all about how much
the audience laugh.

194
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,459
Remember what Mr. Takada wrote?

195
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,171
"Sparks is unique."
That's what he liked.

196
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,760
But he's a pro.

197
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,887
We want everyone to laugh.

198
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,890
We want to be popular with the masses.

199
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,642
You write it.

200
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
That won't work.

201
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,481
My role is to keep the same perspective
as the audience.

202
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,861
Have you read the comments online?

203
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,323
"The funny man from Sparks is gloomy."
"He's unrelatable."

204
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,910
I know.

205
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,590
The <i>New Star Battle</i>...

206
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,883
We won it.

207
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,553
What's with all the confidence?

208
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,891
-Tokunaga.
-What?

209
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,893
The <i>New Star Battle</i>...

210
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,061
We won it.

211
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,688
Thanks, everyone.

212
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,897
-It's great.
-I know.

213
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,441
I think it'll work.

214
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,443
Let's run it through.

215
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,237
-Hello, we're Sparks.
-Please enjoy the show.

216
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,948
-Dial it again.
-Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

217
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,910
The number you're trying to reach
belongs to artificial intelligence.

218
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,412
It has formed its own identity.

219
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,290
It is busy planning
the extinction of the human race.

220
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,876
-Sorry, but we cannot connect you.
-Stop it!

221
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,669
That's way too scary!

222
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,466
I don't know, but maybe you could...

223
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,761
Don't you have a joke
that younger audiences will like?

224
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,722
A joke that's more pop.

225
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,308
-We don't need to be pop.
-Do you have one?

226
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,899
How about this?
-Bip, bop, bop. Prrr...

227
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,193
-Call telephone. No reception--
-Hey. Hey!

228
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,320
Come on. Do it properly.

229
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,946
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

230
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,949
Call telephone.
No reception. Or switch off!

231
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,534
Fuck!

232
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,620
Hey, come on.

233
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,623
-Too much?
-What's with all the energy?

234
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,125
But that's probably better. Any others?

235
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,712
Jokes like that. Energetic ones.

236
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,963
How about this?

237
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,884
-Hello, young friends--
-You can be more pumped up.

238
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,302
Hello, young friends!

239
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,430
I'm in the fairy forest,
singing with my bird friends!

240
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,017
Hop on a Pegasus,
and join us across the rainbow bridge!

241
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,685
That's good.

242
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,813
It's easy to understand. It's good.

243
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,148
-Let's do that.
-I don't really like it.

244
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,900
But let's try it.

245
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,902
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

246
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,903
Hello, young friends!

247
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,115
I'm in the fairy forest,
singing with my bird friends!

248
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,409
Hop on a Pegasus, and join us--

249
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,371
-Aren't we sucking up too much?
-This is perfect for the <i>New Star Battle</i>.

250
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,082
It's so cheesy. Do we need it?

251
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,708
If we want to make a living.

252
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,926
Bip, bop, bap, bop...

253
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,180
Something just drove by. What was it?

254
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,890
"Bip, bop, bap, bop."

255
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,060
I wonder...

256
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,396
Was it a police car? An ambulance?

257
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,233
What made that sound?
"Bip, bop, bap, bop."

258
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,865
What drove by? "Bip, bop, bap, bop."

259
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,286
Ah, I know. It was a "bippobapo-bus."

260
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,415
Hello. Sorry for the wait.

261
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,961
-Where shall we go?
-Wherever we can drink.

262
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,921
We've got sushi...

263
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,132
Soba noodles...

264
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,842
Mr. Kamiya.

265
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,429
Why don't we buy something here
and drink in a park somewhere?

266
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,307
This will do?

267
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,768
I really like these little delicatessens.

268
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,146
You like it trashy.

269
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,899
You win. I'll keep you company.

270
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,901
Welcome.

271
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,777
What would you like?

272
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,947
The most expensive is shrimp tempura.
Ten of them?

273
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,909
That much shrimp?

274
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,702
What do you want?

275
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,920
Tokunaga.

276
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,896
Wanna walk to Nikotama?

277
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,567
Mr. Kamiya...

278
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,654
I don't want my bag to
stink of fried chicken.

279
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,614
Can we eat this first?

280
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,701
Nothing whets your appetite more than
the aroma of fried chicken.

281
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,329
If you think it smells bad
when it comes from your bag,

282
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,957
your mind's just playing tricks on you.

283
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,792
It's cool.

284
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,252
Shit's cool!

285
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,759
<i>There were so many things</i>
<i>I wanted to ask Mr. Kamiya.</i>

286
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,387
You should walk more.

287
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:39,684
<i>Apparently I'm convinced he knows</i>
<i>the answer to everything.</i>

288
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,769
When you walk around, you realize things.

289
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,650
There are so many funny things
just waiting for you to notice them.

290
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,902
Take care, old lady.

291
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,917
-Something happened.
-I wonder what.

292
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,211
It looks okay.

293
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,900
Mr. Kamiya, don't you ever worry
about other people's opinions?

294
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,902
Where's this coming from?

295
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,907
Well, it pisses me off
when people talk bad about me.

296
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,826
But I don't really care.

297
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,495
Even if they badmouth you
on the Internet?

298
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,794
On the Internet, so many people talk
about others like they were trash.

299
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,922
When that hate gets aimed your way,
it hurts.

300
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,133
I'd rather be punched.

301
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,178
It even drives some people to suicide.

302
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,889
I think it's insane.

303
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,934
But...

304
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,979
think about the hater.

305
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,942
If hating is the only thing they can do
to make it through the night alive,

306
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,903
I think it's okay.

307
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,909
I hope they write the most painful thing
about me they can think of.

308
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,250
But I can't ignore them.

309
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,714
If you worry about what people think,
you'll wear yourself out.

310
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:38,219
In the end, will their words
have any effect on what you create?

311
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,597
It'll make no difference.

312
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,018
We're not that smart.

313
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,562
We do what we want.

314
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,607
If it's funny, we'll make a living.

315
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,859
If it's not, we'll get weeded out.

316
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,403
That's all.

317
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,120
<i>We weren't making a living.</i>

318
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,124
<i>Were we not funny?</i>

319
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,262
Kudos to the food of the masses.

320
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,889
It tastes great even when it's cold.

321
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,017
How rude of you
to complain about its smell.

322
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,877
Damn.

323
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,171
That stinks!

324
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,730
Tokunaga.

325
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,857
Come on in.

326
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,028
-Hi.
-Hello.

327
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,906
-Sorry for making you wait.
-Sorry for calling you in.

328
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,116
-Was it hard to find?
-A little.

329
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,367
Wow.

330
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,161
-Cool?
-Yes.

331
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,705
<i>There was an unwritten rule</i>
<i>for young comedians:</i>

332
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,876
<i>Don't mix with the juniors</i>
<i>that your partner is close with.</i>

333
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,961
-Beer, please.
-Beer?

334
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,339
-I'll have an Oolong & Shochu.
-Coming up.

335
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,887
-You're doing well lately.
-Not at all.

336
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,264
We're still as poor as ever.

337
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,240
Have you heard?

338
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,202
About Kamiya.

339
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:14,291
He's in so much debt,
he's nearly beyond help.

340
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,296
You know. When he's with you,

341
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,882
he tries to act too big.

342
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,179
I know that's part of
what makes him funny, but...

343
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,475
unless something changes,
we won't be able to do <i>manzai</i> anymore.

344
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,186
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,773
He always pays for me.

346
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,192
-From now on, I'll try to--
-No.

347
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,362
That's not what I mean.
You should stay close with him.

348
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,906
Stay close.

349
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,955
Are you in the next
<i>New Comedy Star Battle</i>?

350
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,623
Yes.

351
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,916
We're in it, too.

352
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,876
Ahondara will be, too?

353
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,169
You didn't know?

354
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,130
Kamiya didn't tell you?

355
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,008
-He did.
-He did?

356
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,178
But he hasn't decided
which act we should do.

357
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,017
The <i>New Star Battle</i>...

358
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,353
You know how duos break up
if they don't do well?

359
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,316
It might be our very last chance.

360
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,654
What do you mean?

361
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,364
Don't get me wrong.

362
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,949
We're not gonna quit.

363
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,201
Don't write us off.

364
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,206
Sorry.

365
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,917
But Kamiya...

366
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,671
When he talks about you,
he always looks so happy.

367
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,633
He really must like you.

368
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,635
Kamiya...

369
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,928
He likes you.

370
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,645
The big time... Wouldn't that be nice?

371
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,113
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

372
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,118
It is with profound regret that I inform
you this number is currently unavailable.

373
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,789
-Please forgive me. Please, pretty please!
-That message is too polite!

374
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,749
"Please, pretty please!"?

375
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,043
And there's no need to bow.
Nobody can see you.

376
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,545
And stop doing that giggle at the end.

377
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,590
I didn't like it the first time.
No more giggling.

378
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,843
And stop poking your chin out
between jokes.

379
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,679
-It's distracting.
-That, too?

380
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,263
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

381
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,767
The number you're trying to reach
belongs to artificial intelligence.

382
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,644
It has formed its own identity--

383
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,562
Hey. Stop it.

384
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,815
Why do that one?

385
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,860
It's, "I'm in the Fairy Forest,
singing with my bird friends!"

386
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,863
I think this one's better.

387
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,075
Are we going through this again?
We already agreed!

388
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,828
Don't you want to win?

389
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,581
You're asking me?!
Nothing works if you're flimsy.

390
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,043
I took your advice on the first act,
but the second should be more like

391
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,503
the real Sparks.

392
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,089
If either of our acts flops,
we're done for.

393
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,177
I think we're funnier than anybody.

394
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,055
But we agreed to go for the masses.

395
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,183
Put your balls on the line.
We've got two days left.

396
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,879
Okay.

397
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,678
You know which one?

398
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,807
Start from where we were.

399
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,017
I'll start.

400
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,145
"Please, pretty please!"?
That message is too polite.

401
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,773
Do it properly.
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

402
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,276
The number you're trying to reach
belongs to artificial intelligence...

403
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,820
Isn't this one better?

404
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,071
Enough already.

405
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,783
"Hello, everybody!" is better.

406
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,243
Once more.

407
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,956
-"Hello, everybody!"
-"Hello, young friends! I'm in the..."

408
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,876
That message is too polite.
"Please, pretty please!"?

409
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,211
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

410
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,838
Hello, young friends!
I'm an artificially intelligent being!

411
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,841
I've got my own identity!
Why don't we...

412
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,470
-I hate artificial intelligence.
-Hear me out.

413
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,847
I've got my own identity!

414
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,558
Why don't we all make
the human race extinct!

415
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,860
"Bip, bop, bap. Prrr..."
"Hello, young friends!

416
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,572
I'm in the fairy forest,
singing with my bird friends!

417
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,868
Hop on a Pegasus,
and join us across the rainbow bridge!"

418
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,057
<i>Mr. Kamiya.</i>
<i>Congratulations on your 30th birthday.</i>

419
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,984
<i>The first time we met,</i>
<i>you were four years younger than me.</i>

420
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,487
<i>The fact you're still four years younger</i>
<i>is quite a shock.</i>

421
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,661
INCOMING TEXT
FROM: SAIZOU KAMIYA

422
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,499
<i>You seem busy lately.</i>
<i>Are you writing my biography?</i>

423
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,420
OF COURSE I AM

424
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,463
<i>Where was he?</i>

425
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,882
MY BIOGRAPHY SOUNDS BORING

426
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,550
<i>He replied straight away.</i>

427
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,135
PLEASE MAKE IT FUNNIER, MR. KAMIYA

428
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,720
KAMIYA'S BIOGRAPHY
VOL. 7

429
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,847
YOU'RE RIGHT

430
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,434
PLEASE DO SOMETHING LEGENDARY

431
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,609
Hello?

432
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,653
Where are you?

433
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,365
I'm in the Parthenon.

434
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,034
Where are you, Mr. Kamiya?

435
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,956
Inside a gooey chocolate fondue pot.

436
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,835
It's so sweet, I'm melty, melty, melting.

437
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,840
-Are you okay?
-Of course I am!

438
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,592
No, you're not.

439
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,928
<i>Are you okay?</i>

440
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,851
Know what?

441
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,606
I was just eavesdropping
on a nearby young couple.

442
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,902
<i>Stop doing strange things</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

443
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,906
The girl had one of those...

444
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,868
She had a fluffy white thing
around her neck.

445
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,870
She said to the guy:

446
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,832
"Say ten nice things about me."

447
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,417
She really did.

448
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,837
<i>Did he tell her?</i>

449
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,673
Yeah.

450
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,217
He rattled them off like he was chanting.

451
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,845
I bet she asks him all the time.

452
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,390
<i>Sounds scary.</i>

453
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,019
So...

454
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,231
Say ten nice things about me.

455
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,319
Why should I?

456
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,115
Why not? Tell me.

457
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,576
I don't want to.

458
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,913
I'll tell you next time,

459
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,208
if you're wearing
a fluffy white thing around your neck.

460
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,504
I won't wear one of those. Tell me.

461
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,639
For starters...

462
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,938
You can split dick tempura
in two without cringing.

463
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,778
You're really flexible when you do your
"gateway for up-and-coming comedians."

464
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:29,536
And you can sing Takuro Yoshida's songs
while impersonating Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi.

465
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,872
Who cares?

466
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,376
Let me see.

467
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,977
Mr. Kamiya...

468
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,192
If he can get a laugh...

469
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,863
he's not afraid to say
something violent or lewd.

470
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,115
He'll take any risk.

471
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,798
And...

472
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,841
Mr. Kamiya...

473
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,845
It doesn't matter who is
or isn't watching...

474
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,558
Even if no one in the audience
wants it...

475
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,855
he does what he believes in.

476
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,068
He doesn't suck up to anybody.

477
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,198
He never fails to fight.

478
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,161
You got it.

479
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,675
But...

480
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,136
above all...

481
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,142
the most amazing thing about
Mr. Kamiya is...

482
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,109
he made me his disciple.

483
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,865
What balls!

484
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,243
You had the balls to say that?

485
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,873
What balls!

486
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:41,877
Yep.

487
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,507
<i>Tomorrow was the big day.</i>

488
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,843
<i>The New Comedy Star Battle.</i>

489
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,142
THE 3RD ANNUAL
NEW COMEDY STAR BATTLE

490
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,526
-Hello.
-Hello.

491
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,693
Hello.

492
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,821
I came up with something yesterday.

493
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:55,534
After "the humble Pegasus,"
I'll keep going a bit.

494
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,827
You'll dig further?

495
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,830
-"Please ride the humble Pegasus and--"
-Mr. Osaki!

496
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,707
Good morning, sir.

497
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,584
Hello, Takada. Thanks for coming.

498
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,505
Not at all. It's a great honor
you invited me as a judge.

499
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,881
But it's a shame.

500
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,842
This year's comedians
are all small-fry.

501
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,137
I guess we could decide
nobody deserves to be champion.

502
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,640
Sir, that'd be going a bit far.

503
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,809
-Are you free afterwards?
-Yes.

504
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,228
There's a nice BBQ restaurant nearby.
Coming?

505
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,729
I'd love to.

506
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,858
-You only drink highballs, right?
-That's correct, sir.

507
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,037
You're small-fry.

508
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,209
That's too polite. Way too polite.

509
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,753
What's with the
"Please, pretty please!"?

510
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,047
And there's no need to bow.
Nobody can see you.

511
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,258
-Once more.
-Do it properly.

512
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,801
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

513
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,596
Hello, young friends.
I'm an artificially intelligent...

514
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,055
Wrong one. Sorry.

515
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,558
Hey.

516
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,852
Hello.

517
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,604
Hello!

518
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,022
-Hello.
-Hi.

519
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,648
Are you nervous?

520
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,275
Hello.

521
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,568
Hi.

522
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,904
-Hello.
-Hello!

523
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,158
-You're rehearsing?
-Of course we are.

524
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,244
It won't make any difference.
Not at this stage.

525
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,787
Let us be.

526
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,789
-You wanna be more successful?
-No--

527
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,417
How sly.
And you look pale.

528
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,585
Hello.

529
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,838
There's some space here.

530
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:40,680
Welcome to the 3rd Annual
<i>New Comedy Star Battle</i>!

531
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,729
The number you're trying to reach,
tee-hee,

532
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,898
is either out of range,
tee-hee,

533
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,609
or the power is turned off,
tee-hee-hee-hee!

534
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,278
Stop being so creepy!
Enough with that creepy giggle!

535
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,990
I want a friendly but polite message
on my voicemail.

536
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,242
Oh, I get it. Call me again.

537
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,078
Bip, bop, bap. Prrr...

538
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,124
It is with profound regret that I inform
you this number is currently unavailable.

539
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,795
-Please forgive me. Please, pretty please!
-That message is too polite!

540
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,630
What's with the
"Please, pretty please!"?

541
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,633
And there's no need to bow.
Nobody can see you.

542
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,679
-Can't you make a happier version?
-A happier one? Okay, call me.

543
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,365
Hello, young friends!

544
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,827
I'm in the fairy forest,
singing with my bird friends!

545
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,120
Hop on a Pegasus,

546
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,329
and join us

547
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,124
across the rainbow bridge!

548
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,716
That's too much like a fairy tale!

549
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,968
"Come join us!"?

550
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,847
And your Pegasus was tiny.
I don't want a baby Pegasus.

551
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,558
The baby Pegasus is still there?

552
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,435
Pegasus, how old are you?

553
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,020
-I'm 62 years old.
-Baby Pegasus is a veteran.

554
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,523
He's quite old.
May I ask your name?

555
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,359
-I don't have one yet.
-Sixty-two years without a name?

556
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,696
Baby Pegasus has lived
for 62 years without a name?

557
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:24,826
-The... sorry... unavailable.
-The voicemail has bad reception, too?

558
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,536
That's the worst reception ever.

559
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,997
Your voicemail is
the worst I've ever heard.

560
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,541
-I think so, too!
-You think so, too?!

561
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,835
-I've had enough.
-Thank you.

562
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,050
-We nailed them.
-Told you.

563
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,261
-I wrote it.
-I told you.

564
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,104
My, oh, my.

565
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,648
Now we know
why you recommended Sparks.

566
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,859
They were a great hit
with the audience.

567
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,697
Their acts are usually rough,
but that was quite refined.

568
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,826
They've been around for seven years.
It's the least you'd expect.

569
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,835
Hello!

570
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,841
Hi, we're Ahondara.
Please enjoy the show.

571
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:26,137
The show's nearly halfway through.
You must be a little tired.

572
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,765
I'll help you wake up.

573
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,310
-Mind if I use scare tactics?
-You're gonna scare them awake?

574
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:33,978
Do you have life insurance?

575
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,772
Do you have life insurance?

576
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,524
Do you have life insurance?

577
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,528
-You're gonna die.
-Your scare tactics are too scary.

578
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,695
-It's okay.
-Why?

579
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,156
-I have no insurance either.
-You don't?!

580
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,407
Why did you ask?

581
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,077
I won't die
even if a truck runs over me.

582
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,080
What are you talking about?

583
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,706
You're too random.

584
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,001
If you need prior notification to keep up,
you should've told me.

585
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,795
I don't need notification.

586
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,215
Like I said, I won't die
even if a truck runs over me.

587
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,759
Trucks kill.

588
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,179
-Have you ever really thought about it?
-Of course not.

589
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,850
There's a huge truck
racing towards you at 100 km/h.

590
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,310
-Would you die?
-Yes!

591
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,855
-Trucks are deadly.
-But I won't die.

592
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,191
-Why not?
-How dumb are you?

593
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,403
A truck's racing towards me...

594
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,946
Bang!

595
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,535
-I died.
-You died?!

596
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,871
You said you wouldn't die.

597
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,665
When you thought about it,
you survived, right?

598
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,166
Let me try once more.

599
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,211
I'll imagine it properly this time.

600
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,963
Let's go step by step.

601
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,423
Here goes.

602
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,968
If a dozen veteran lawyers talk badly
about me as they approach,

603
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,220
-I'll die.
-Why is that lethal?

604
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,930
Are you that unstable?

605
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:55,101
A football player is running towards me
as he searches for his long-lost sister...

606
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,021
Unfortunately I'm standing on her head.
I'm dead.

607
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,816
What kind of situation is that?
Take your foot off the sister's head.

608
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,276
Time for the truck!

609
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,737
A truck is speeding right at you!

610
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,572
-Bang!
-Bang!

611
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,703
-I died.
-You died?

612
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,873
You're dead?
What's with the pose?

613
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,500
-Damn, I died.
-You're singing?

614
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,670
-I died!
-He's getting into the song.

615
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,423
-He's really into the song.
-Ohbayashi...

616
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,469
-Will you cry at my funeral?
-Don't go all emotional on me!

617
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,221
What's wrong?
You're not gonna die, right?

618
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,266
<i>That's right, I won't die!</i>
<i>Do the truck again!</i>

619
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,353
<i>-A truck speeds towards you.</i>
<i>-I run towards the truck.</i>

620
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,855
<i>-I died.</i>
<i>-You died?!</i>

621
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:45,610
-Is this for real? It's a totally new act.
-They're the funniest so far.

622
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,779
<i>-I died.</i>
<i>-You died?</i>

623
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,948
<i>-That's the most dead so far.</i>
<i>-The most dead?</i>

624
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,368
<i>-Me, the driver, and everyone else.</i>
<i>-You killed them all?</i>

625
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,702
-Ohbayashi...
-What?

626
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,790
-Will you cry at my funeral?
-Stop going sad like that.

627
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,043
I never had a friend before.
You're my first friend ever.

628
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,004
Who cares?
This isn't the time to confess.

629
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,632
You won't die, right?
That's what you said.

630
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,801
Stop looking so depressed.
What's wrong?

631
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,803
What is it? Kamiya!

632
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,429
Kamiya! Say something!

633
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,141
-I love making jam.
-What a strange new personality.

634
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,310
I've had enough.
Thank you.

635
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,906
Wow.

636
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,867
Usually they only make
other professionals laugh.

637
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,037
-But it worked with the audience today.
-It did.

638
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,082
I always found them
unsuitable for television.

639
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,209
But I think that act will work.

640
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,837
Out of today's offerings,
they didn't seem bad.

641
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,841
My stomach hurts.

642
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,385
<i>That's the end of</i>
<i>the first half of the show.</i>

643
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,138
<i>We will now have</i>
<i>a ten-minute interval.</i>

644
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,765
-What was their name?
-I don't know.

645
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,142
These guys!

646
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,852
-Truck... Bang!
-Truck... Bang!

647
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,311
-I died.
-I died.

648
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,613
Your act went well.

649
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,117
We only just started.

650
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,384
I told you that would work, too.

651
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,848
Kamiya's Biography, Chapter Two.

652
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,626
<i>Hello, we're Ahondara.</i>

653
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,505
<i>The show's nearly halfway through.</i>
<i>You must be a little tired.</i>

654
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,798
<i>I'll help you wake up.</i>

655
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,801
<i>-Mind if I use scare tactics?</i>
<i>-You'll scare them awake?</i>

656
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,219
<i>Do you have life insurance?</i>

657
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,470
<i>Do you have life insurance?</i>

658
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>Do you have life insurance?</i>
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

659
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,016
<i>Your scare tactics are too scary.</i>

660
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,393
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>I have no insurance either.</i>

661
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,771
<i>You don't?</i>
<i>Why ask?</i>

662
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,315
<i>I won't die</i>
<i>even if a truck runs over me.</i>

663
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,858
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

664
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,821
<i>If you need prior notification to keep up,</i>
<i>you should've told me.</i>

665
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,364
<i>I don't need notification.</i>

666
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,700
<i>Like I said, I won't die</i>
<i>even if a truck runs over me.</i>

667
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,827
<i>You would die.</i>

668
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,664
<i>-Have you ever really thought about it?</i>
<i>-Of course not.</i>

669
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,833
Are they doing the same act?

670
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,960
They must have some plan.

671
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,838
-It's exactly the same.
-I don't get it.

672
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,840
They are <i>ahondara</i> (boofheads).

673
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,008
<i>How dumb are you?</i>

674
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,220
<i>A truck's racing towards me...</i>

675
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,222
<i>Bang!</i>

676
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,560
<i>-I died.</i>
<i>-You died?!</i>

677
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,605
<i>So you would die. Just as you would</i>
<i>if you got hit by a meteor.</i>

678
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:10,857
<i>I died. This is bad.</i>

679
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,734
<i>But you're the one making this up.</i>

680
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,488
<i>Hang on. Let me focus.</i>
<i>I'll imagine it properly.</i>

681
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,866
<i>Drive at me in the truck</i>
<i>at just the right time.</i>

682
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,994
See?
They started something.

683
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,830
But that won't go down well
with the judges.

684
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,790
They're not getting
that many laughs.

685
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,834
They really are <i>ahondara.</i>

686
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,465
<i>A football player is running towards me</i>
<i>as he searches for his long-lost sister...</i>

687
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,468
<i>Unfortunately I'm standing on her head.</i>

688
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,846
<i>-I'm dead.</i>
<i>-Of course you are.</i>

689
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,391
<i>-Time for the truck!</i>
<i>-A truck is speeding right at you!</i>

690
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,893
<i>-Bang!</i>
<i>-Bang!</i>

691
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,024
<i>-I died.</i>
<i>-You died?</i>

692
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,443
<i>What's with the pose?</i>
<i>You look alive to me.</i>

693
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,652
<i>I'm dying!</i>

694
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,029
<i>Why are you singing?</i>

695
00:44:58,863 --> 00:44:59,947
<i>Ohbayashi...</i>

696
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:04,619
<i>-Will you cry at my funeral?</i>
<i>-Don't go all emotional on me.</i>

697
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,870
<i>Stop it.</i>

698
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,413
<i>You're not gonna die, right?</i>

699
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,790
<i>-You said you won't die.</i>
<i>-That's right, I won't die!</i>

700
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,792
<i>-Do the truck again!</i>
<i>-Okay!</i>

701
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,671
<i>-A truck speeds towards you!</i>
<i>-I run towards the truck!</i>

702
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,840
<i>-I died.</i>
<i>-You're dead.</i>

703
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,843
<i>So, Ohbayashi...</i>
<i>Will you cry at my funeral?</i>

704
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,554
<i>I told you before.</i>
<i>Don't go all emotional on me!</i>

705
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,390
<i>I never had a friend before.</i>
<i>You're my first friend ever...</i>

706
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,772
-They're laughing!
-What is this act?!

707
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,774
<i>Manzai</i> is too hard to lip-sync!

708
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,192
We're doing an okay job!

709
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,154
<i>Kamiya! Say something!</i>

710
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,906
<i>I love making jam.</i>

711
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,868
<i>What a strange new personality.</i>
<i>I've had enough. Thank you.</i>

712
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,074
Ladies and gentlemen,

713
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,494
let's congratulate our
Gold, Silver and Bronze award winners!

714
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,835
The New Comedy Stars
have been born.

715
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:40,965
Now we'll receive a comment
from the head judge, Mr. Osaki. Thank you.

716
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,259
I'm the head judge, Osaki.

717
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,012
Everyone put up a great fight today.

718
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:50,141
Personally, I was reassured
there's still new talent out there.

719
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:56,605
However, I was disappointed that one duo
chose to use recorded audio in their act.

720
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,315
It wasn't <i>manzai.</i>

721
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,987
<i>Manzai</i> is all about the organic connection
between audience and artist.

722
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:07,825
The live chemical reaction
is what creates laughter inside us.

723
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,412
In conclusion, I warn the winners
not to become complacent.

724
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,415
I also warn them to never forget
comedy needs an audience...

725
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,585
<i>As far as Mr. Kamiya was concerned,</i>

726
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,670
<i>the audience expected</i>
<i>nothing but </i>manzai,

727
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,506
<i>but he'd created an accident</i>
<i>right before their eyes.</i>

728
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,801
<i>That was his idea of funny.</i>

729
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,845
Congratulations to our winners,
The Curl!

730
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,600
<i>That's who Mr. Kamiya was.</i>

731
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,857
Please look forward to the next
<i>New Star Comedy Battle</i>.

732
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,110
And thank you all for coming!

733
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,947
Thank you!
