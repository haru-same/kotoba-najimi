1
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,231
-I'm thinking about buying a pet.
-Yeah?

2
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,318
-Pets make good company, right?
-Are you gonna buy an old fart?

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,986
No! Who wants an old fart for a pet?!

4
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,030
-I want a parrot.
-A parrot? Okay.

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,034
When I get home, it'll say,
"Welcome back!" Wouldn't that be sweet?

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,246
-"Welcome back"? Your parrot talks?!
-Why do you sound scared?

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,876
-It's so smart, it knows how to talk?!
-No! It'll talk because I'll make it talk.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,714
If it does exactly what you tell it to do,
that'll make you feel better?

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,551
-You'll forget the fact you made it talk?
-That's what parrots are all about.

10
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,931
Let me take a guess: When we were kids,
alarm clocks played recorded messages.

11
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,892
Most kids got their friends to say
"Wake up!" for them.

12
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,603
But you were such a loner,
you taped your own voice.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,981
-Am I right?
-Don't tell everyone!

14
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,234
You woke yourself up.
You're the loneliest guy in history!

15
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,321
Where'd my conversation go?
The topic was "Parrots." Parrots are cute!

16
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,864
No talking parrots for me.

17
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,324
-They're cute.
-Nope.

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,201
-Talking parrots are cute.
-Nope.

19
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,828
-They're cute.
-They're not.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,122
-They are!
-They're not!

21
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,791
SUMMER, 2001

22
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,671
-Is this how summer festivals originated?
-Huh?! I have no idea how they started.

23
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,589
We were talking about
how cute parrots are.

24
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,894
I'm getting nervous.

25
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,732
I'm gonna take a crap.

26
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,527
I'm home!

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,615
<i>I stepped on the cat</i>

28
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,868
<i>I stepped on the cat and it scratched me</i>

29
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,996
<i>The cat scratched me</i>

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,124
<i>The cat got shocked and it scratched me</i>

31
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,543
<i>You bad cat!</i>

32
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,921
<i>Clip your claws!</i>

33
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,965
<i>Come down off the roof</i>

34
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,801
You brought the clothes in?

35
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,177
Thanks, guys.

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>The cat meows</i>

37
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,724
<i>It's as harmless as a kitten</i>

38
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,894
<i>With its silky voice</i>

39
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,230
<i>The cat is playing cute</i>

40
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,777
Aiko, why aren't you playing?

41
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,029
-There's no sound.
-No sound?

42
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,907
You have to switch it on.

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,909
Try it now.

44
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,041
Aiko?

45
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,180
What's wrong, Aiko?

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,142
Did you get nervous?

47
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,186
Why are you crying?

48
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,323
"I'm thinking about buying a pet.
Pets make good company, right?"

49
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,783
"You gonna buy an old fart?"

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,702
"Who wants an old fart? I want a parrot."

51
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,745
"A parrot? Okay."

52
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,581
"When I get home, it'll say,
'Welcome back!' Wouldn't--"

53
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,666
When will they get off stage?!

54
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,128
You rotten whore!

55
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,880
Mr. Kanichi!

56
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,513
<i>The Atami Sea Fireworks will begin soon.</i>

57
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,892
<i>Please move towards the observatory area.</i>

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,483
Please do not speak such sadness.

59
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,319
Let go, I say!

60
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,908
Blinded by the sparkle of his diamonds,
you belong to that scoundrel, Tomiyama!

61
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,786
No longer are you the Miya I once loved.

62
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,788
Don't be so cruel!

63
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:52,250
'Twas all to pay for your studies abroad.

64
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,669
I am...

65
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:59,132
I am sad beyond words.

66
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,634
Way to go, chairman!

67
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,093
Bravo!

68
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,346
Miya!

69
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,892
You say 'twas all for me, but Miya...

70
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,101
Excuse me.

71
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,897
The fireworks start at 8 p.m., don't they?

72
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,565
So?

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,110
When will those old farts finish?
Can't you make them stop?

74
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,488
I can't. They're big-shots down here.

75
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,115
-That's a good reason.
-Whose side are you on?

76
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,493
But the fireworks will start.

77
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,622
Don't worry. You'll get paid.

78
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,375
...from tonight I shall become a demon.

79
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,878
And I shall feast upon
betraying beasts like you.

80
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,547
Dear Miya.

81
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,840
Or shall I call you "Lady Tomiyama"?

82
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:41,967
You whore.

83
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,388
Take a good look at the face
of the honest man I was.

84
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,598
Mr. Kanichi!

85
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,183
Forgive me!

86
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,645
If the moon is hidden
one year from tonight,

87
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,855
know that I still curse you.

88
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,360
It will be my tears that cloud the sky,
just as they do tonight!

89
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,904
You're the best in Japan!

90
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,532
A true star!

91
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,326
Thanks for watching.

92
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,957
<i>Encore! Encore! Encore!</i>

93
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,459
Ladies and gentlemen,

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,087
to humbly fulfill
your requests for an encore,

95
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:24,718
we shall do the famous scene
where Kanichi rejects Miya one last time.

96
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,886
Hello.

97
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,475
Go for it!

98
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,812
Mr. Kanichi, I have one question:

99
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,482
What would you do if I married Tomiyama?

100
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
What?!

101
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,906
<i>Prepare to see Atami's night sky</i>
<i>light up in color.</i>

102
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,868
<i>The big show starts soon!</i>

103
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,579
-You were amazing this year, too.
-Really?

104
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,581
Thank them once again!

105
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,500
Next up, Sparks!

106
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,634
Hello!

107
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,802
We're Sparks. Please enjoy the show.

108
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,721
You know what?

109
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,640
-I'm thinking about buying a pet.
-Yeah?

110
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,935
-Pets make good company, right?
-Are you gonna buy an old fart?

111
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,395
No! Who wants an old fart for a pet?!
I want a parrot.

112
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,438
A parrot? Okay.

113
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,318
When I get home, it'll say,
"Welcome back!" Wouldn't that be sweet?

114
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,613
-"Welcome back"? Your parrot talks?!
-Why do you sound scared?

115
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:32,452
-It's so smart, it knows how to talk?!
-No! It'll talk because I'll make it talk.

116
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,957
If it does exactly what you tell it to do,
that'll make you feel better?

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,918
-Yeah!
-You'll forget the fact you made it talk?

118
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,461
That's what parrots do!

119
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,381
The audience loved it.

120
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,468
Chairman! You were amazing!

121
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,223
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much, good work.

122
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,933
Now I've tried it, I agree.

123
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,518
Talking parrots are cute.

124
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,854
After listening to you,
I don't want a parrot at all!

125
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,274
-Don't change your mind so easily!
-Why are you angry with me?

126
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,819
I've had enough! Thank you.

127
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,746
Thanks, guys.

128
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,081
I'll get revenge.

129
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,000
Next up, Ahondara!

130
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,882
We're Ahondara.

131
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,050
Howdy.

132
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
I'm psychic.

133
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,930
I can tell whether a person will go
to heaven or hell

134
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,724
just by looking at their face.

135
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,934
Really? That's amazing, if it's true.

136
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,935
Hell.

137
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,978
Hell.

138
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,857
Hell, hell, hell...

139
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,275
Hell, hell, hell...

140
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,943
Hell, hell, hell...

141
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,236
Oh, my.

142
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,405
Our audience is full of sinners. Repent!

143
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,449
Why are you talking like that?
You're weird.

144
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,825
Hell...

145
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:54,951
Hey!

146
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,411
You wanna fight?!

147
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,163
Come here and say that!

148
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,497
Hell, hell, hell...

149
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,832
I'll kill you!

150
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,167
Shut up.

151
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,293
Asshole!

152
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>it's time for our biggest fireworks...</i>

153
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,718
Sorry, little lady.
You're going to a fun hell.

154
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,137
Couldn't you lie and tell her "heaven"?

155
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,389
Nope. Lying is a sin.

156
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,724
You're a tough judge!

157
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,894
I'll buy you an ice cream later.
And a doll you can dress up.

158
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,729
Let her choose what she wants.

159
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,397
Hell, hell, hell...

160
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,818
Hell, hell, hell...

161
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,072
And that guy's late for the fireworks!

162
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,990
-Where's he going?
-To hell.

163
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:34,908
I knew it!

164
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,869
-He gets fireworks for eternity.
-Well said!

165
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,414
Hell, hell, hell...

166
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,999
Hell, hell, hell...

167
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,753

HIBANA
- Spark -

174
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,643
Coming to the afterparty?
Same place as always!

175
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,938
-You coming?
-I'd love to.

176
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,608
How about you?

177
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,817
No, thanks.

178
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,110
Okay. Later.

179
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,842
Excuse me...

180
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,101
Here are your beers.

181
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,188
Drink up.

182
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,942
Order whatever you want.
I've got the bill.

183
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,781
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Tokunaga, from Sparks.

184
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,950
I'm Ahondara's Kamiya.

185
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,261
You chose an amazing name.
"Ahondara." (Boofhead)

186
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,973
I'm not good at naming things.

187
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,185
My dad always called me "Ahondara,"
so I just took that.

188
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,981
What did your dad call you?

189
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,607
My dad...

190
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,202
That's what he called me.

191
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,540
Hey.

192
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,420
He called you "My Dad"? Don't scare me.

193
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,091
I couldn't tell if it was a joke
or if your dad was an idiot.

194
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,384
Sorry.

195
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,344
Don't apologize.

196
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,180
Always say whatever comes into your head.

197
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,807
Yessir.

198
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,355
One more chance.
What did your dad call you?

199
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,940
"All You Need Is Love."

200
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,316
-He was?
-"Ghost Town."

201
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,027
-Mom said?
-"Go To School!"

202
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,820
-Your reply?
-"Today's Sunday."

203
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,488
Those nicknames are ridiculous!

204
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,083
It took us a while
to find a punchline there.

205
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,878
Was comedy always this difficult?

206
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,921
I nearly vomited.

207
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,884
Let's drink.
Like I said, I've got the bill.

208
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,179
I've got the bill, too.
I mean, let's split it.

209
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,889
You stupid?

210
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,766
In the world of comedians,

211
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,185
big brothers always pay
for little brothers.

212
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,936
Yessir.

213
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,369
Boss, I'm out.

214
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,079
See you tomorrow.

215
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,922
Our style of comedy is <i>manzai</i>.

216
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:45,176
Being a <i>manzai</i> artist isn't about
having a funny imagination.

217
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,056
When we're on stage,
we bare our souls for everyone to see.

218
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,267
That means

219
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,979
we have to be true to our hearts
and live life to the fullest.

220
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,900
If you preach about
how a <i>manzai </i>artist should act,

221
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,944
you'll never be one.

222
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,904
You'll just be a wannabe.

223
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:12,120
But, Mr. Kamiya, aren't you preaching
about how a <i>manzai</i> artist should act?

224
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,710
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,046
Were you trying to be funny?

226
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,801
If you were,
I'll beat the crap out of you.

227
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,052
I wasn't.

228
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,055
It was an honest question.

229
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,905
"Preaching about how <i>manzai</i> artists should
act" and "talking about <i>manzai</i> artists."

230
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,365
They are two totally different things!

231
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,618
I was talking about <i>manzai</i> artists, okay?

232
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,037
Yessir.

233
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,835
Sorry, but we're closing up now.

234
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,088
Could we have two more drinks each?

235
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,882
Yeah, sure.

236
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,633
Here on holiday?

237
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,886
I'm a local god.

238
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,393
-Boss, just two highballs.
-Coming up.

239
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,853
Bye.

240
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,695
"Local god"? That totally fell flat.

241
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,951
Mr. Kamiya.

242
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,745
What?

243
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,292
Please let me be your apprentice.

244
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,892
Something smells good.

245
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,770
Is it some kind of flower?

246
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,272
Isn't it a bit strong?

247
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,192
Idiot. That's what's good about it.

248
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:17,703
-And about you becoming my apprentice...
-Yessir?

249
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,622
There's one condition.

250
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,333
One condition? What is it?

251
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,921
I want you to write my biography.

252
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,339
Biography?

253
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,675
Like those famous people?

254
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,343
Yeah. You got it.

255
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,763
If you write it,
you can be an official apprentice.

256
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,641
Understood. I'll write it.

257
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,437
From now on, write about each day

258
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,065
in your own words, while it's still alive.

259
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,818
Yessir.

260
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,907
But why do you want a biography?

261
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,911
Because I don't want you to forget me.

262
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,538
Are you dying?

263
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,956
No, idiot!

264
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,458
Why would I die? Don't kill me.

265
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,586
-I thought you--
-Don't think I'll die.

266
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:14,427
Tonight, we were like two gorillas
shaking hands with too strong a grip.

267
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,638
What? Ouch!

268
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,932
-Thank you.
-Let go, gorilla!

269
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,018
I'm this way.

270
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,978
Thanks for dinner!

271
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,939
It was nothing.

272
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,942
Nothing at all.

273
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,303
INOUE'S STATIONERY STORE

274
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,058
Hello?

275
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,314
Excuse me.

276
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,109
-What do you want?
-It's not what you think.

277
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,118
How about this one?

278
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,496
It looks great.

279
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,918
-How much is it?
-Two thousand yen.

280
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,920
It's not cheap.

281
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,887
Kamiya's biography

282
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,099
Part 1

283
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,857
Beginning August, 2001

284
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,902
I'm thinking about buying a pet.

285
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,447
Pets make good company, right?

286
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,575
Are you gonna buy an old fart?

287
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,045
Hey...

288
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,673
-"We're finally alone."
-"But, teacher! We mustn't."

289
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,926
-"I know you want it."
-"But, teacher..."

290
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,886
"Teacher...

291
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,262
Teacher!"

292
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,224
Did you hear our math teacher
got a divorce?

293
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,436
Remember Ms. Takayama?
She married that firefighter.

294
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,064
-Miyuki got divorced?
-You're on a first-name basis?

295
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,149
-When?
-About two months ago.

296
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,984
Mom said so.

297
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,613
-So, it's a lie.
-It's true.

298
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,448
-Really?
-I think so.

299
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,535
-Go get her.
-Why didn't you tell me earlier?!

300
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,412
"Write about each day, in your own words,
while it's still alive."

SEIWASOU APARTMENTS

303
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,681
"I'm thinking about buying a pet.
Pets make good company, right?"

304
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,392
"You gonna buy an old fart?"
"No! Who wants an old fart?!

305
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,354
-I want a parrot."
-"A parrot? Okay."

306
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,274
"When I get home, it'll say,
'Welcome back!' Wouldn't that be sweet?"

307
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:07,363
"'Welcome back'? Your parrot talks?
It's so smart, it knows how to talk?!"

308
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,887
-Sorry.
-You're sleepy.

309
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,223
-No.
-Yes, you are.

310
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,683
I am.

311
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,394
Welcome.

312
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,603
Welcome!

313
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,722
What? What is with you?!

314
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:18,434
What are you talking about?
I said, parrots that talk are cute.

315
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,269
-They are?
-Yeah.

316
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,895
I'll be your parrot. Come home.

317
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,064
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

318
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,858
What's your retirement plan?

319
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,110
Why would he say that? He's not my mom!

320
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,945
When will you redecorate?

321
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,907
Don't diss my interior designing.
I want a cute parrot.

322
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,743
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

323
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,287
I need to have a word with you.

324
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,539
Sorry, my line.

325
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,753
Don't you wanna be big?

326
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,838
Of course I do.

327
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,090
Once more.

328
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,884
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

329
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:56,263
-I need to have a word with you.
-This doesn't sound good.

330
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,392
-Pass the sauce.
-"Pass the sauce"?!

331
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,852
I said a "cute" parrot!

333
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,081
Hello?

334
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,876
Where are you?

335
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,878
At home.

336
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,672
That means you're in Tokyo?

337
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,259
If you were in Osaka, I'd buy you dinner.

338
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,887
Don't you ever come down here?

339
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,889
Well...

340
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,559
Who'd call us for a gig?
We don't even have work here.

341
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,813
Are you writing my biography?

342
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,900
Yes, but aren't biographies published
after the subject dies?

343
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,153
Then make it a trilogy.

344
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,906
"Part 1 - Alive."
"Part 2 - Dead."

345
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,742
"Part 3 - The Afterlife"?
I don't think so.

346
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,494
It's funnier that way.

347
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:07,709
I just talked with a random old guy
about my childhood.

348
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,672
My family wasn't poor or anything.

349
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,218
I had computer games and toys
and stuff to play with.

350
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,597
But he said his generation
didn't have anything to play with.

351
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
I shouldn't say this, but...

352
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,354
I really envy him.

353
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:32,568
If I didn't have anything to play with,
I would've created something myself.

354
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,570
That would've been great fun.

355
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,947
You know what I mean. You were poor.

356
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,534
Well, yeah. We were poor--

357
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,869
Tell me that story.

358
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,121
The one about your sister.

359
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,706
Again?

360
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,541
Come on. Tell me.

361
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,593
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

362
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,570
-I'm home!
-Welcome back.

363
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,452
Sis, it's a piano!

364
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,876
What's wrong, sis?

365
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,422
You don't have to use that anymore.

366
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,891
Come on, sis.

367
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,851
Play it.

368
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,156
Mom, thank you so much.

369
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,290
One, two, three, four!

370
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,211
<i>I stepped on the cat</i>

371
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,881
<i>I stepped on the cat and it scratched me</i>

372
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,426
<i>The cat scratched me</i>

373
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,512
<i>The cat got shocked and it scratched me</i>

374
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,474
<i>Mom bought it for my sister</i>
<i>without telling anyone.</i>

375
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,101
<i>Dad was so angry.</i>

376
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,020
<i>"Why did you buy it?!</i>
<i>Look how poor we are!"</i>

377
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,899
<i>But the neighbors complained</i>
<i>it was too noisy.</i>

378
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,278
<i>She ended up going back</i>
<i>to her paper keyboard.</i>

379
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,154
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

380
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,532
<i>What a beautiful story.</i>

381
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:50,289
There's a certain type of laughter
nobody but you can create.

382
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:28,660
Sorry, run out of battery. Later.

383
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,640
HYUGA AGENCY

384
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,537
Good morning.

385
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,830
Good morning!

386
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,123
Is Mr. Ogata in?

387
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,877
WE CAN'T HELP YOU

388
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,422
Good morning.

389
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,894
Why did he take on comedians?

390
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,233
Look at them.
They have no chance of making it big.

391
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,154
Our boss and his whims...

392
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,783
We manage actors, right?

393
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,582
I'm suddenly in charge of comedians?

394
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,709
What am I supposed to do?

395
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:02,879
Boss.

396
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,299
Thank you.

397
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:14,850
Why not give it less negativity,
and try your best?

398
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,853
Boss, I didn't mean...

399
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,646
There's no problem.

400
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,483
This is your next job.

401
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,616
A supermarket event?

402
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,540
Rome wasn't built in a day.
You're going to the top, right?

403
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,709
But, I mean...

404
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,711
It's always the same thing.

405
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,421
So?

406
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,882
What about TV?

407
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,053
Listen, guys.

408
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,474
There are no big or little jobs.

409
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,019
It's all about whether your <i>manzai</i>
is good or bad.

410
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,606
If you do good <i>manzai</i>,
you'll get your chance.

411
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,483
But...

412
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,945
Don't the TV stations have open mic days?

413
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,325
-"Open mic"?
-Yes.

414
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,293
Oga-boy.

415
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,212
What is an "open mic"?

416
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,839
"Open mic"?

417
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,841
A new sex position?

418
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,761
-Really?
-What's it like?

419
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,346
Boss!

420
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,851
Nishioka's <i>Memory</i> has been canceled.

421
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,187
The Saturday night show?

422
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,022
For real?!

423
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,527
Hello? Hyuga speaking.

424
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,111
I'm the boss.

425
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,198
It's... dead.

426
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,534
-For real?
-For real?

427
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,035
It can't be!

428
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,288
No way.

429
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,707
Bye.

430
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,839
-This isn't <i>manzai</i>.
-You're right.

431
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,259
-Why us?
-I wonder.

432
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,598
Okay, guys. Let's march!

433
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,146
Your zipper's open.

434
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,649
-Behind you.
-Zip me up.

435
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,905
What are you doing?

436
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,865
I can't see.

437
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,162
Welcome to the 2001
New Tokyo Beef Fair!

438
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,373
It's the hottest place to be!

439
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,667
Roll up! Roll up!

440
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,296
Would you like a free sample?

441
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,881
Roll up!

442
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,845
The one and only New Tokyo Beef Fair!

443
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,692
The 2001 New Tokyo Beef Fair!

444
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,528
Would you like a sample?

445
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,032
Great job, guys!

446
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,325
-Thanks, sir.
-Thanks, sir.

447
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,162
-You sure are professionals.
-Can't hide it, huh?

448
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,415
Here's lunch. Plenty left over.

449
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,584
-Eat up!
-Thank you.

450
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,377
"Graze" up.

451
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,505
Like cows...

452
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,634
-What the hell?
-Cut it out. He'll hear you.

453
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,845
-I detest him.
-Enough already.

454
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,991
Is this what life's about?

455
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,035
I wanna be big.

456
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,079
I wanna be big!

457
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,313
"Hi, parrot, I'm home."

458
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,989
"Can't you take me
for a walk more often?"

459
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,117
"Don't be so selfish!"

460
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:21,656
"I'm thinking about buying a pet.
Pets make good company, right?"

461
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,826
"Are you gonna buy an old fart?"

462
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,872
"Who wants an old fart for a pet?!

463
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:33,710
I want a parrot. Something cute." Right?

464
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,840
"Do you want dinner? A bath?
Or will you fly away with me?"

465
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,219
"Hi, parrot, I'm home."

466
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,530
"We were robbed?
Tell me what happened!"

467
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,828
"He took your checkbook--"
"We really have been robbed!"

468
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,747
Try coming home.

469
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,500
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

470
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,336
Do you want dinner? A bath?
Or will you fly away with me?

471
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,631
Don't pretend to be my wife.
And I can't fly. I'm not a bird.

472
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,466
I don't need a wife-like parrot.

473
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,551
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

474
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,179
A strange man just came in
and took my birdseed.

475
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,847
We had a weird thief?

476
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,851
What kind of thief would steal
your birdseed instead of my money?

477
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,646
-That'll work.
-Yeah.

478
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,524
-Hi, parrot, I'm home.
-You should get a wife.

479
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,444
Shut up! That's why I got you.
To forget my loneliness!

480
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,531
Wanna try putting
those wife routines together?

481
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,491
Yeah, they should connect.

482
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,076
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

483
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,412
Do you want dinner? A bath?
Or will you fly away with...

484
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,791
-Fly. Away. With. Me?
-What's with the strange rhythm?

485
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,835
And you kind of stammered.

486
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,586
It's "Fly away with me."

487
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,505
-Flyaway withme.
-Still strange.

488
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,841
"Flyaway withme." Who says that?

489
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,385
You were closer the first time.

490
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,182
SEIWASOU APARTMENTS

491
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,935
ROOM 101
TOKUNAGA

492
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,291
Hello?

493
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,877
Where are you?

494
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,170
Tokyo.

495
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,173
That excuse won't work much longer.

496
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,384
What do you mean?

497
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,514
We're making the move to Tokyo.

498
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,642
I'm going to be a big Tokyo boy myself.

499
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,896
Did something happen?

500
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,857
Well...

501
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,693
Nothing in particular.

502
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,071
We've been working in Osaka for six years.

503
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,659
Our buddies have either become TV stars,
or they've quit.

504
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,914
When we do theater gigs,
we're surrounded by younger comedians.

505
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,041
They treat us like dinosaurs.

506
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,836
So, I said to my partner,
"Why not go to Tokyo?"

507
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,839
I told the agency today.

508
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,843
I see.

509
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,221
So, that's that.

510
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,141
I'll call you when I find a place to live.

511
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,561
I'm hanging up.
I've got a lot to organize.

512
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,896
Goodbye.

513
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,080
This smells good.

514
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,833
It's "sweet olive tree" season.

515
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,835
The scent is so lovely.

516
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,673
Don't you think it's a bit strong?

517
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,467
-That's what's good about it.
-Really?

518
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,845
Look this way.

519
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,190
I'm hungry.

520
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,442
Wanna grab something to eat?

521
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:45,670
<i>Mr. Kamiya was coming to Tokyo.</i>
<i>I was happy beyond words.</i>

522
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:50,383
<i>But at the same time,</i>
<i>I had an uneasy feeling.</i>

523
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:57,807
<i>Back then, I had no idea why</i>
<i>such a feeling was creeping up on me.</i>
