1
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,399
There will be a new comedy show
on prime time TV.

2
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,988
Mr. Ogata's been lobbying for us
to be members of the main cast.

3
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,115
-Really?
-It gets better.

4
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,619
Mr. Satoshima is producer
and Mr. Sasamoto is chief director.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,663
The staff from
<i>The Gateway to Stardom!</i>

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,915
Mr. Satoshima likes us, right?

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,918
Mr. Ogata said, "I think Sparks
will get it." He really said so!

8
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,044
HIBANA
- Spark -

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,963
Is that why we've been called in today?

10
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,882
-We have a weekly show?!
-Is this real?

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,883
This is real!

12
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,052
A weekly show, on prime time TV!

13
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,096
Finally.

14
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,097
The big time!

15
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,348
We made it!

16
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,307
Yeah!

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,268
Hi, Erika.

18
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,144
HYUGA AGENCY

19
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,772
-She has good news.
-Oh, my.

20
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,274
She has good news.

21
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,947
We got it!

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,990
Yeah!

23
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,158
Boss, we got it!

24
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,868
A weekly spot!

25
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,328
Yeah!

26
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,294
What's wrong?
We got the spot, right?

27
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,754
We got a spot, but...

28
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,174
it's not Sparks. Buu Fubuubu got it.

29
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,509
Buu Fubuubu got it?!

30
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,471
Sorry.

31
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,068
Sparks.

32
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,738
Come here.

33
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,169
They even signed Shikatani for that show.

34
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,755
Why are we the only ones cut?

35
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,133
They admitted you are funny, but...

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,596
But for prime time...

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,766
they said your personas were too plain.

38
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,270
"In this day and age,
we need happy, pop comedians."

39
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,440
-The producer's words.
-Mr. Satoshima said that?

40
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,734
You see...

41
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,113
he wouldn't say yes,
no matter how much I begged.

42
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,118
-But there will be more chances.
-Here's one already.

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,495
A gig at a supermarket.

44
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,873
-Come on.
-Go for it.

45
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,750
No cry, no cry.

46
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,585
Come here!

47
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,218
Be at the gates outside
Yachiyo Station at 8 a.m.

48
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,345
Two 30-minute shows.

49
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,767
You can do it!

50
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,773
What's with Mr. Satoshima?

51
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,947
At the end of the day,
I guess he didn't like us.

52
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,451
What's with "happy, pop comedians"?

53
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,245
Bitch!

54
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,223
I don't wanna do supermarket gigs anymore.

55
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,101
We have to.

56
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,272
Why can't our agency get proper jobs?

57
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,777
-There wasn't anything else.
-That's not true.

58
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,990
-Those assholes should do their job.
-Don't call them that.

59
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,716
Mr. Ogata tries hard for us.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,760
He's got ideas and plans.

61
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,694
So...

62
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,989
you know many people.

63
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,785
Can't you talk to someone?

64
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,748
I guess I could.

65
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,627
Ask someone to do something
that will make things better.

66
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,920
I can't do that.

67
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,923
It's not like we don't need help.

68
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,009
-Then you ask someone.
-Who?

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,385
I don't have anyone.

70
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,555
You should have gone out
and met more people.

71
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,059
-That's why I'm asking you a favor!
-That's not how people ask favors!

72
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,355
In the meantime...

73
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,774
why don't you do supermarket gigs?

74
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,152
-They're decent work, too.
-Stay out of this.

75
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,905
We're talking about our work.

76
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,740
Shut up.

77
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,577
-I think about things, too.
-Shut up!

78
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,662
Hey!

79
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,455
What's with the attitude?

80
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,084
-We should--
-I told you to shut up.

81
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,418
-Hey!
-Stop it!

82
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,920
Let's calm down.

83
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,380
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,760
Excuse me for a minute.

85
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,851
Hey...

86
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,482
Yurie?

87
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,109
You okay?

88
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>It's time for:</i>

89
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,047
-The Food Critic Battle!
-The Food Critic Battle!

90
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,758
<i>-Let 'em have it!</i>
<i>-We won't lose!</i>

91
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,802
<i>-We're better critics!</i>
<i>-Watch out, Chidori!</i>

92
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,013
<i>-We'll destroy you!</i>
<i>-We couldn't lose!</i>

93
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,098
BUU FUBUUBU'S
"THE FOOD CRITIC BATTLE"

94
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,688
After the shoot,
Chidori treated them to a BBQ dinner.

95
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,356
Lucky them.

96
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,776
They also paid for their cab rides home.

97
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,237
Chidori knows how to treat people.

98
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,283
Sparks were supposed to be
as famous as them by now.

99
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,745
I thought we hit the big time,
but we keep getting smaller.

100
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,331
Life has its ups and downs.

101
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,292
And people change their opinions
all the time.

102
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,921
They claim to be your fan,
then they laugh when you're down.

103
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,923
Amateurs are the cruelest.

104
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,551
Sparks didn't make it that big.

105
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,474
I wanna do <i>manzai</i> on TV.

106
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,811
Stage work is better than nothing.

107
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,857
I was happy to be back.

108
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,903
Doing <i>manzai</i> in front of
an audience like this.

109
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,782
How can you say that?
You know how bad we flopped.

110
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,283
We killed 'em.

111
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,410
Far from it.

112
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,790
We haven't changed anything. What's wrong?

113
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,129
Good job, sirs.

114
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,090
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

115
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,345
Bye.

116
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,430
-Goodbye, sirs.
-Goodbye, sirs.

117
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,390
Bye.

118
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,102
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

119
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,812
Sir, you were so funny.

120
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,064
-Don't lie.
-Honestly, sir.

121
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,858
-How much does Sparks earn in a month?
-Don't ask that!

122
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,777
-About 30,000 yen?
-They don't earn that much.

123
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,487
Are they angry?

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,074
Cut that out. Seriously.

125
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,284
-We didn't mean it.
-We apologize.

126
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,370
Goodbye.

127
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,020
Goodbye.

128
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,772
Thank you.

129
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,320
-Hello.
-Hi.

130
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,699
Congratulations on that new show.

131
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,200
Thank you.

132
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,995
I thought we'd be on it together.

133
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,997
That would've been nice.

134
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,416
I'm so scared.

135
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,168
I don't know if I can do it.

136
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,420
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

137
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,922
-Do your best.
-Thank you.

138
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:08,882
I'm out.

139
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,759
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

140
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,385
SHIKATANI

141
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,680
Can I have your autograph, too?

142
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,765
-Sure.
-Thanks.

143
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,769
-Mr. Satoshima, what are you doing here?
-I had a meeting about a shoot.

144
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,064
Hello.

145
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,232
It's a shame about the show.

146
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,779
I wanted you in our main cast,
but the others had different plans.

147
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,531
We haven't given up yet.

148
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,785
SHIKATANI

149
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,746
-We cast the first episode's guest.
-Really?

150
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,581
We've got a superstar.

151
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,166
Are you gonna be okay?

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,919
I'm Shikatani. You can't go wrong!

153
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,755
So...

154
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,923
Sorry. I'm out.

155
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,299
Goodbye.

156
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:52,842
Tokunaga.

157
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,677
Any plans for tonight?

158
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,598
-Not really.
-How does dinner sound?

159
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,058
You don't mind?

160
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,311
I know a nice chicken hot pot restaurant
near here.

161
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,944
I like how Sparks has a unique presence.

162
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,488
I really like acts like that.

163
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,702
"I'm gonna stick my fingers
so far up your ass, I'll tremble!"

164
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,916
I'm trying to set up a new show
for young comedians.

165
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,502
Everyone will make acts
on the same topic.

166
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,922
If there's movement, I'll let you know.

167
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,091
Sure. Thank you.

168
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,079
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

169
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,789
Sorry. Goodbye.

170
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,053
<i>That was it for Sparks.</i>

171
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>We disappeared from TV.</i>

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,402
<i>Time marched on.</i>

173
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,779
<i>And it left us behind.</i>

174
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,785
JANUARY, 2009
SPARKS

175
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,214
Maybe I should get a part-time job.

176
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,761
I have rent to pay.

177
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,388
I can't let Yurie do everything for me.

178
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,268
-Why not move somewhere cheaper?
-It's not that easy.

179
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,854
I'm not like you. I'm not alone.

180
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,613
Thank you. Two morning specials?

181
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,407
-We'll pay separately.
-Okay. Four hundred fifty yen each.

182
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,208
You're tight for money too, right?

183
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,964
I'd rather write something funny
than do a part-time job.

184
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,388
Thank you.

185
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,866
No matter how much you write,
we'll only get crappy jobs.

186
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,245
We're lucky to have work.

187
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,249
Those gigs won't change anything.

188
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,210
Hey. We're on TV.

189
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,253
Wait.

190
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,338
That's something amazing.

191
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,675
We came this far. We're nearly there.

192
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,218
Hey, wait up!

193
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:23,886
Hey.

194
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,389
If we keep doing <i>manzai,</i>
our time will come.

195
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,851
If you do a part-time job, you lose.

196
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,537
KAMIYA'S BIOGRAPHY
VOL. 1

197
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,644
Big bro, it's time to go.

198
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,365
I heard my partner joined
the Shikatani Army.

199
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,200
He did.

200
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,703
He said he'd follow you forever.

201
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,415
Well...

202
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,794
it means Shikatani has appeal.

203
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,088
No, he's a traitor.

204
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,216
He's your partner.
Don't talk about him like that.

205
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,425
But...

206
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,640
It's not a bad idea to follow
guys on a winning streak.

207
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,934
You, too.

208
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,686
Why not join the Shikatani Army?

209
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,189
No way. I couldn't bear it.

210
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,316
I understand, but

211
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,402
you shouldn't worry about being faithful.

212
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,573
I can't forgive him. No way.

213
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,622
Hey!

214
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,207
You're a great driver!

215
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,461
-What?
-I've never seen anyone drive so good.

216
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,839
-What is this?
-Damn, you're good.

217
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,842
I said something nice as a thank you.

218
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,760
You're crap at thanking people.

219
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,138
-I don't feel thanked at all.
-Really?

220
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,307
You should say something nice
about our <i>manzai</i> or our work.

221
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,684
Your work...

222
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,604
How is work lately?

223
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,108
We've got a job
doing our act on TV soon.

224
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,944
-Good for you.
-Thanks.

225
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,529
Wait up.

226
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,531
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

227
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,700
Ouch.

228
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,285
-Careful!
-Sorry.

229
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,661
Okay.

230
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,662
Sorry.

231
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,047
Sorry.

232
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,469
Can we put it down?

233
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,012
Let's put it down.

234
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,347
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

235
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,394
It's not gonna fit.

236
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,355
-It'll go in sideways--
-Let's cut it.

237
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,442
-We can't cut it.
-But it won't fit.

238
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,624
Big bro, he looked real happy.

239
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,584
That's nice.

240
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,880
It's pretty.

241
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,594
So pretty, it's mean.

242
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,651
Welcome.

243
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,070
-Someone's waiting for me.
-This way.

244
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,833
-Beer?
-Thank you.

245
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,627
-Little lady! A beer and a highball.
-Sure.

246
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,259
How's my hair? Pretty cool, eh?

247
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,677
Yes.

248
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,390
I didn't end up like Beckham last time.

249
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,684
I did it properly.

250
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,448
I moved again.

251
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,491
Where this time?

252
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,910
Azabu? Or Roppongi?

253
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,372
You won't find rooms for 50,000 yen
a month in Azabu or Roppongi.

254
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,755
There might be a doghouse.

255
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,258
Wouldn't it be funny if there was
a dog <i>manzai</i> artist?

256
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,473
That might actually suit me.

257
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,642
After all, I don't like talking.

258
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,354
Since when have you not liked talking?

259
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,857
When I listen to you talk,

260
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,070
I get frustrated with myself
for speaking so slow.

261
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,909
What do you think about
when you're not talking?

262
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,708
To start off with,
one word pops into my head.

263
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,086
But that leads to a new flow of thought.

264
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,463
-Then?
-And then...

265
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,384
I get all these images
racing through my mind.

266
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,261
In the end,
I don't know where to start.

267
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,223
That's what's funny.

268
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,018
But it would be better
if I could speak faster.

269
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:48,979
Well...

270
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,275
when you speak fast,
you can communicate more.

271
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,195
You get more opportunities
to make a laugh, too.

272
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,697
I agree.

273
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,785
So, it's definitely better to speak fast.

274
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,204
But...

275
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,249
-you can't do it, right?
-Right.

276
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,836
That makes you unique.

277
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,422
You can create things
that are different.

278
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,719
You think so?

279
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,391
There's a certain type of laughter
nobody but you can create.

280
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,317
So, tell me...

281
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,902
Tell me that...

282
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,779
Tell me that story.

283
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,864
You know.

284
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,365
This one.

285
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,825
"I Stepped On The Cat"?

286
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,034
Yeah.

287
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,786
Again?

288
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,037
Hurry up and tell me.

289
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,668
I have an older sister.

290
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,795
We were really poor,

291
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,798
but she liked to sing
and play musical instruments.

292
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,259
So, Mom worked hard at her part-time job,

293
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,887
and one day she brought home a big piano.

294
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,891
Dad got angry and was yelling,
"What did you buy that for?!"

295
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,394
but my sister was so happy
and she started playing the piano.

296
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,647
Since we lived in a dirty,
little old apartment,

297
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,193
everyone in the neighborhood
started complaining about the noise.

298
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,487
Since she couldn't play it,
she made a paper--

299
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,905
You can speak fast!

300
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,991
Then my sister went to
an electric organ school.

301
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,119
But she practiced on a paper keyboard,
so she didn't know there was a switch--

302
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,496
You <i>can</i> speak fast.

303
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,001
-Mr. Kamiya.
-What the hell?

304
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,258
Number 82!

305
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,722
Number 82!

306
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,517
What does that mean?

307
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,812
There's no meaning!

308
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,817
Number 82.

309
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,572
Number 82.

310
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:08,911
Number 82.

311
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,791
Number 82.

312
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,626
Number 82!

313
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,086
Number 82!

314
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,882
Number 82!

315
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,552
-Number 82?
-Number 82.

316
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,471
What does that mean?

317
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,181
There's no meaning!

318
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,893
-There's no meaning!
-No meaning!

319
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,312
Kamiya's number eighty two.

320
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,941
I took the plant Kamiya gave me
to his favorite riverbank.

321
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,735
I planted it next to Kamiya's "box seat."

322
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,614
I had fried chicken and watched
the sunset, like we did once before.

323
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,408
Kamiya takes meaningless things and

324
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,343
-What's wrong?
-We need to talk.

325
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,595
Can I come in?

326
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,395
Excuse us.

327
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,283
Take a seat.

328
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,077
I brought some dumplings.

329
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,370
Eat up.

330
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,788
You don't mind?

331
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,166
Thanks.

332
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,546
These look good.

333
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,007
With soy and sugar syrup.

334
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,346
Will tea do?
That's all I have.

335
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,513
Thanks.

336
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:30,928
Open it.

337
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,640
Thanks.

338
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,279
Thank you.

339
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,205
What is it?

340
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,468
Eat up.

341
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,139
Hang on.

342
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:16,849
Just a sec.

343
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,279
I'll just hang these out.

344
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,042
What's up? Sit down.

345
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,628
Can I use two pins for this?

346
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,761
I'm...

347
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:55,929
I'm gonna be a dad.

348
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:57,973
Really?

349
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,812
-I'm three months pregnant with twins.
-Twins?

350
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,191
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

351
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:12,988
And...

352
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
What?

353
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,797
I'm going back to Osaka with Yurie.

354
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,261
I don't think I can make it
as a comedian anymore.

355
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:40,891
Is that okay?

356
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,786
Okay.

357
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,290
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

358
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,834
No...

359
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,212
-It's not all your fault.
-No...

360
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,164
What will you do in Osaka?

362
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,084
I'll work at a cell phone store.

363
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,421
Yurie's dad will take me on.

364
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,006
I see.

365
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,593
Do your best.

366
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,271
And, Toku-chan...

367
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,858
we're going to get married.

368
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,610
I see.

369
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,448
It feels like our kids are helping us
take the big step.

370
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:34,963
Toku-chan...

371
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,799
can you be our witness?

372
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,804
-I'll do?
-Of course.

373
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,556
Who else would we ask?

374
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,974
You're right.

375
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,827
We should tell the agency right away.

376
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,039
There'll be trouble
if they book us a gig.

377
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,167
You're right.

378
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,629
-Why don't you phone them?
-That won't do.

379
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,423
We have to apologize in person.

380
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,427
Why don't you go now?

381
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,972
-Aren't we gonna submit the papers?
-I'll go by myself.

382
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,932
You should go together.

383
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,684
You're right.

384
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,187
Let's go to the agency tomorrow.

385
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,315
Sorry.

386
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:17,941
Thank you.

387
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,426
So...

388
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,219
You see...

389
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,347
I'm thinking about buying a pet.

390
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,266
Pets make good company, right?

391
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,901
Are you gonna buy an old fart?

392
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,575
No!
Who wants an old fart for a pet?

393
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,827
I want something cute. Like a parrot.

394
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,664
A parrot? Okay.

395
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,462
When I come home after a hard day's work,

396
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,091
it'll say, "Welcome back!"
Wouldn't that be sweet?

397
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,717
Hang on.

398
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,136
"Welcome back"? Your parrot talks?

399
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,807
-Why do you sound scared?
-That's not scary?

400
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,809
It's so smart, it knows how to talk?!

401
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,310
No!

402
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,189
It will talk because I'll make it talk.

403
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,943
If it does exactly what you tell it to do,

404
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,779
that'll make you feel better?

405
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,533
You'll forget...

406
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,828
the fact you made it talk?

407
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,123
That's what parrots are all about.

408
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,501
Let me take a guess:

409
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,255
When we were kids,
alarm clocks played recorded messages.

410
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,633
Most kids got their friends to say,
"Wake up!" for them.

411
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,011
But you were such a loner,
you taped your own voice.

412
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,805
-Am I right?
-Don't tell everyone!

413
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,974
You woke yourself up?!

414
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,812
-You're the loneliest guy in history!
-Where did my conversation go?

415
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,483
The topic was "Parrots." Not clocks.

416
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,110
No talking parrots for me.

417
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,154
-Talking parrots are cute.
-Nope.

418
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,697
-They're cute.
-They're not.

419
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,240
-They are.
-They're not.

420
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,450
-They are.
-They aren't!

421
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,742
-They are!
-They aren't!

422
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,660
They are!

423
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,167
-Is this how summer festivals originated?
-Huh?!

424
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,377
I have no idea how they started.

425
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,379
When parrots talk, they are cute.

426
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,173
-They are?
-Yeah.

427
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,008
Okay. I'll be your parrot.

428
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,801
Come home.

429
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,721
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

430
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,475
-What's your retirement plan?
-Why would he say that?

431
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,393
He's not my mom.

432
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,814
-When will you redecorate?
-Don't diss my interior designing.

433
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,608
I want a <i>cute</i> parrot.

434
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,651
Hi, parrot, I'm home.

435
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,394
This is way too sudden.

436
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,898
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,819
We'll come tomorrow
and apologize to the boss together.

438
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,116
Have you decided your next partner?

439
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,452
No...

440
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,870
I haven't.

441
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,292
Any candidates?

442
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,629
No.

443
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,301
I'm sorry.

444
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,563
I don't...

445
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,821
I don't intend to become a duo
with anyone other than Yamashita.

446
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,804
-Hello.
-Hello.

447
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,807
-Hi.
-Hello.

448
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:07,397
NO WOMAN, NO CRY!

449
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,108
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

450
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,155
-And some for you.
-Thanks.

451
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,576
-This is the schedule.
-Thank you.

452
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,381
Let's go eat. My treat.

453
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,592
-That sounds nice.
-You wanna come?

454
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,553
Let's go.

455
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,138
-Me, too?
-Yep.

456
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,391
This is delicious.

457
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,532
-One more, please.
-Certainly.

458
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:04,537
Hey, you still have work.
Don't blame me if the boss tells you off.

459
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,748
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

460
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,501
Today's okay.
It's the last time.

461
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,461
The last time?

462
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,837
Here you go.

463
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,839
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

464
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,304
Sparks...

465
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,933
They're breaking up.

466
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,144
You're kidding.

467
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,272
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,153
Hang on. What?

469
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,780
What's going on?

470
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,325
Yamashita...

471
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,829
He's getting married. And he's going home.

472
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,255
"Breaking up" means you're going solo?

473
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,677
-I wouldn't be a good solo act.
-What will you do?

474
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,013
You're quitting comedy, right?

475
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,310
You can't be.

476
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,314
Am I right?

477
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,749
What are you talking about?

478
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,920
You're just a little out of form.

479
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,758
You'll be on TV again before you know it.

480
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,682
After all...

481
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,853
you've tried so hard for so long.

482
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,676
So...

483
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,345
let's drink.

484
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,273
Let's drink.

485
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,137
It's been a while.

486
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,597
Welcome.

487
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,500
Thank you.

488
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,467
Thanks.

489
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,270
Boss...

490
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,783
Hey.

491
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:14,913
Here.

492
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,915
Thanks.

493
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,461
So, I'll see you next year.

494
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,220
The man I'm marrying is from Kyushu.
I might not make it back.

495
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,390
I see.

496
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,646
Goodbye.

497
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,918
I haven't seen her before.

498
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,294
Is she a regular?

499
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,174
She's my daughter.

500
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,846
I see her once a year. On her birthday.

501
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:16,933
I see.

502
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,395
What would you like?

503
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,063
Coffee.

504
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,691
Coffee it is.

505
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,455
It's a waste.

506
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,834
It sure is a waste.

507
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,838
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

508
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,055
You're not rushing things?

509
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,642
Sorry, boss, but...

510
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,815
it's a decision we came to together,
and we're happy with it.

511
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,152
Please let us break up.

512
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,487
I'm really sorry.

513
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,710
I saw an amateur <i>manzai</i> contest.

514
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,380
Some high school students competed.

515
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,266
Their act was very self-centered.

516
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,978
Nobody in the audience even smiled.

517
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,776
Nevertheless, they looked ever so happy.

518
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,945
To me, they sparkled.

519
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,493
And I thought:

520
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,037
If I could be with these kids,

521
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,832
they would make me feel
as happy as they looked.

522
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,880
So, even though they were crap,
I signed them up.

523
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,345
They sound really lucky.

524
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,306
They were you. Ten years ago.

525
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,685
That's why I signed you up, ten years ago.

526
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,785
I'm sorry.

527
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,828
Sorry.

528
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,371
I'm sorry we disappointed you.

529
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,331
Don't worry about that.

530
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,958
Stop it.

531
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,751
Sit down. Come on.

532
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,877
Sit down.

533
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,097
Remember one thing for me.

534
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,145
Who is Sparks' biggest fan?

535
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,438
Me.

536
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,737
If you ever change your minds,
let me know.

537
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,780
Okay?

538
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,579
Thank you.

539
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,080
Thank you.

540
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,364
"Hello. We're Sparks.
Please enjoy the show."

541
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:08,372
"I'm thinking about buying a pet.
Pets make good company, right?"

542
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,460
"Are you gonna buy an old fart?"

543
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,212
"No."

544
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,215
"I want something cute. Like a parrot."

545
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,051
"A parrot? Okay."

546
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,308
"When I come home, it will say,
'Welcome back!'

547
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,519
Wouldn't that be sweet?"

548
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,861
"'Welcome back'? Your parrot talks?

549
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,321
Isn't that scary?

550
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,615
It's so smart, it knows how to talk?!"

551
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,408
"No.

552
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,876
It will talk because I'll make it talk."

553
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,808
"Hi, parrot, I'm home."

554
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,729
"What's your retirement plan?"

555
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,943
"Why would he say that?

556
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,407
I want a cute parrot.

557
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,285
Hi, parrot, I'm home."

558
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,465
Damn...

559
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,031
Damn!

560
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,183
Damn...

561
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,957
-Sorry for the wait.
-It's cold out here.

562
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,882
It sure is cold today.

563
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,184
-Does your hair still feel coarse?
-Yeah.

564
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,646
It really can't be helped.

565
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,655
This brings back memories.

566
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,285
I remember back when we worked together.

567
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,875
You gave me so many free haircuts.

568
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,089
But after you got silver hair...

569
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,300
it was like you'd gone beyond my reach.

570
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:54,723
But now you've got black hair,
we're back to the old times.

571
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,942
But about me giving you haircuts...

572
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,778
This will be the last time.

573
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,198
Why?

574
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,745
I'm going to London.

575
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,876
For work?

576
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,044
Study.

577
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,966
I'm planning to study
over there for a while.

578
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,718
Really...

579
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,554
That's amazing.

580
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:35,723
Congratulations.

581
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,183
That's great.

582
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,601
Thanks.

583
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,021
Wow.

584
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,689
London...

585
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:44,899
That's so far away.

586
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,735
Yeah.

587
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,409
Sorry. I'm going this way.

588
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,750
So, I'll see you around.

589
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,084
Take care.

590
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,700
Ayumi!

591
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,669
I wish you all the best.

592
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:54,718
Thanks.

593
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,304
You, too.

594
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,518
Bye.

595
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,771
Go for it!

596
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,589
I love her!

597
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,151
NO MAN, NO CRY!

598
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:02,745
<i>And then...</i>

599
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,457
<i>our final day came.</i>

600
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,698
-Who's that?
-It's not Itokoi.

601
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,451
-When will they be on?
-You're talking too loud.

602
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,911
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

603
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,912
-I'm not.
-You are.

604
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,205
-I'm not.
-You are.

605
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,373
-I'm not.
-You are.

606
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,749
-I'm not.
-You are.

607
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,627
Is this how summer festivals originated?

608
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,711
I don't know!
