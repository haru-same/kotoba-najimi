<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,278
<i>my day starts.</i>

3
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,717
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,887
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

5
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,768
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

6
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

7
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,028
MIDNIGHT DINER:
TOKYO STORIES

8
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,990
CORN DOG

9
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,207
Master, I got everything.

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:05,959
Thank you.

11
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,169
What took you so long?

12
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>This is Serao Kesera,</i>
<i>a master comedian in Asakusa.</i>

13
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,593
<i>He suddenly requested pancakes,</i>

14
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,264
<i>so he made his ex-assistant Hajime</i>
<i>go out to buy the ingredients.</i>

15
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,307
Hey.

16
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:27,022
<i>Hajime has become popular as a TV actor.</i>

17
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>I hear that he is more popular</i>
<i>than his master.</i>

18
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,912
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,915
This is for you, Hajime.

20
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,047
I didn't have a regular sausage,
so I used fish sausage.

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,466
I had extra batter,
so I made this for you.

22
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,719
Thank you. It looks delicious.

23
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,764
Wait. Give it to me.

24
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,140
No.

25
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,727
-Why not?
-Because I love corn dogs.

26
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,147
Oh, come on, Hajime. Please.

27
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,816
Let's switch.

28
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,444
You wanted a pancake,
so I went out to buy the ingredients.

29
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,155
I changed my mind. Okay?

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,241
-No way.
-Then just a bite.

31
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,534
-One bite.
-No.

32
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,160
You!

33
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,038
I'm asking nicely,
and that's how you treat me?

34
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,666
Who do you think helped you
become an actor?

35
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,543
Don't fret over just a corn dog.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,672
Why get so upset over a corn dog?
Your pancake is getting--

37
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,094
Hey! No, stop!

38
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,557
Hajime, give it to him.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,308
I'll make a new one for you.

40
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,436
That's not the point.

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,730
He always behaves like this.

42
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,483
The fish sausage is a nice touch.

43
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,444
Master, this is delicious.

44
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,532
<i>My corn dog became his favorite.</i>

45
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,786
<i>Since then, Serao often comes</i>
<i>to my place by himself.</i>

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,039
-Hey.
-Welcome.

47
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,916
-He's here.
-Master comedian!

48
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,462
<i>Many of my customers are his fans.</i>

49
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>They get excited whenever he comes.</i>

50
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,632
Master, a corn dog, please.

51
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,010
-Me, too.
-Me, three.

52
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,428
Sure.

53
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,234
Even though she's way past her prime,

54
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,111
she still got it going on.

55
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,031
As I poked her from the back...

56
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,702
Just like that.

57
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,372
So it got me going.

58
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,583
I tried to fondle her boobs.

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,293
I reached around.

60
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,296
Her ripened breasts...

61
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,549
were soft and moist.
Fit nicely in my palm.

62
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,177
Then she suddenly said,

63
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,887
"What are you trying to touch?"

64
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,139
"Your boob, of course."

65
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,185
"That's not where they are.
My boobs are higher."

66
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,062
Turned out, what I was fondling

67
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,523
was the old woman's love handles!

68
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,821
No dirty jokes in front of ladies.

69
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,282
Come on, babe. You like it, don't you?

70
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,785
That's sexual harassment.

71
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,205
Calm down, Rumi.
This is a part of his material.

72
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,373
Material?

73
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,043
You don't know him? Mr. Serao Kesera.

74
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,797
Some call him the last master comedian
of Asakusa.

75
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,592
I always watched your stand-up comedy
on TV when I was a kid.

76
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,510
Really?

77
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,055
You know Hajime Moriwaki, a TV actor,
right?

78
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,557
Yes, I know him.

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,351
He used to be an assistant
of this master comedian.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,437
It's nothing.

81
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,691
Hajime Moriwaki.
A good-looking guy, isn't he?

82
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,236
And he's funny. I like his
choice of words.

83
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,739
Good-looking and funny?
That's a perfect man.

84
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,241
Well, unfortunately,

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,537
his "boy" is not impressive at all.

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,206
Does Hajime Moriwaki have a son?

87
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,666
That's not what he means.

88
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,752
A perfect one is called
a thousand earthworms.

89
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,297
But his is like a single earthworm.

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,258
It's not long. It's not hard.

91
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,220
God doesn't give two gifts.
Now I believe in God.

92
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,389
Have you seen it?

93
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,058
I saw it when he washed my back
at a bathhouse.

94
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,185
What?

95
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,731
You can tell whether it's long or not
at a bathhouse.

96
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,233
But how do you tell, if it's soft or hard?

97
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,861
How about yours?

98
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,823
Some call mine the Anaconda of Asakusa.

99
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,909
A very elusive anaconda.

100
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,496
SERAO KESERA

101
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,373
I had a heart attack.

102
00:06:55,457 --> 00:07:00,045
Luckily I survived it.
Do you know what caused it? Viagra.

103
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,130
Yup. That was it.

104
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,882
It's not good for my heart.

105
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,803
But you know, at my age,
I really need it.

106
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,096
See, right here.

107
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,308
Otherwise, my "boy" wouldn't work.

108
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,978
So, now I'm risking my life to make love.

109
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,897
Shakespeare once said,

110
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,192
"To do or to die. That is the question."

111
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,617
My "boy" is very active
only when I wake up.

112
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,786
Good job, sir.

113
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,664
-Good job.
-Thanks.

114
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,132
Hello.

115
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,636
-Hey, TV actor.
-How are you?

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,890
-Did you see my show?
-Yes.

117
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,309
I came since I hadn't in a while.

118
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,520
What's wrong with you?

119
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,314
It's very sweet of you to say that.

120
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,900
-Let's go eat something.
-Sure.

121
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,193
Wait for a moment, okay?

122
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,656
-Are you ready? Say "cheese."
-Is everything in the frame?

123
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,700
It's blurry. One more time.

124
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,618
Excuse us.

125
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,455
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Hajime Moriwaki?

126
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,999
-Yes.
-Lucky me!

127
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,292
Can I have your autograph?

128
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,547
Can we take a picture?

129
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,841
-Sure.
-I love your shows.

130
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,926
-Would you?
-Me?

131
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,553
Thank you, sir.

132
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,015
-Are you ready?
-Thank you.

133
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,224
Get ready.

134
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,059
Yes. Get a nice one.

135
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,605
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

136
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,523
Let's go now.

137
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,151
Excuse me.
Can we get your autograph, too?

138
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,068
Sure.

139
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,111
This one.

140
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,821
Please. Thank you.

141
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,411
Thank you.

142
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,955
Sir, can you get a taxi?

143
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,582
Okay. I got it.

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,003
Hey. Here. Right here.

145
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,007
Girls, sorry.

146
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,925
He must go now.

147
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,886
Sorry about that. See you soon.

148
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,016
What was that?

149
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,852
I should be the main attraction.

150
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,647
Come on. You should be proud of him.

151
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,400
Your pupil has become such a big star.

152
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,070
A handsome face matters most?

153
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,114
Men should be judged by skills.

154
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,409
Don't blame me. I didn't choose this face.

155
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,038
-Then let's switch faces.
-Absolutely not.

156
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,499
What did you say, bastard?

157
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:47,754
"Absolutely not"? That's so mean.
You are an asshole.

158
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,297
SHIORI

159
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,193
What a baby!

160
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,490
You've got a handful.

161
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,701
You do, too.

162
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,668
Miyoko...

163
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,963
don't you like younger men?

164
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,132
Yes, I do.

165
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,719
What do you mean?

166
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,518
Nothing.

167
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,149
You don't have the guts.

168
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,362
Hello?

169
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,407
I need a car.

170
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,055
Hey, that person over there.
Is that Hajime Moriwaki?

171
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,892
-You recognize him? He's famous, huh?
-Who?

172
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,269
A TV actor. He's very popular nowadays.

173
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,772
I don't watch TV at all.

174
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,989
Serao Kesera?

175
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,660
-You're here. I knew it.
-Good evening, sir.

176
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,872
"Good evening"? You asshole.

177
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,416
-What's the matter?
-You...

178
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,711
You slept with Miyoko, didn't you?

179
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,379
Yes.

180
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,424
-You said "yes"?
-That's right.

181
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,345
A pupil sleeps with his master's woman?

182
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,141
What planet are you from? You asshole!

183
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
Ouch!

184
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,482
You always take my stuff, too.

185
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,109
What? Shut up!

186
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,237
You, bastard!

187
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,822
Please stop.

188
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,202
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me!

189
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,915
Your wiener is so small...

190
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:35,463
that it would belong in
a kindergartener’s lunch box.

191
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:40,718
How could you carry such a small mushroom?

192
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,683
Get up, you asshole!

193
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,769
Say it again. I'll kill you.

194
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,230
You know what Miyoko said?

195
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,607
She said she slept with you,

196
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,070
but your penis is so small that she
couldn't tell if it was in or not.

197
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,281
-That's it! I'll kill you!
-Shut up!

198
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,450
Hey, that's enough.

199
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,997
Fighting shall be taken outside.
That's the house rule.

200
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,088
Hajime.

201
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,925
You are expelled.

202
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,594
I'm done anyway.

203
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,059
<i>After that,</i>

204
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,938
<i>Serao started drinking heavily.</i>

205
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,071
More alcohol.

206
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,734
HAJIME MORIWAKI
BIG BREAK ON STAGE

207
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,863
-Hello, sir. How are you?
-How are you, sir?

208
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,533
Master Serao, it's time.

209
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,751
-Your turn is coming up.
-Shut up!

210
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,213
Sir? Where are you going?

211
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,678
Here you go.

212
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,432
I'm sorry about the other day.

213
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,518
That was immature of me.

214
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,854
Have you seen Serao since then?

215
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,316
No, I haven't.

216
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,612
He's been on the bottle these days.

217
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,573
He often gets dead drunk.

218
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,369
I suspect that he may not
be working anymore.

219
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,664
Nobody likes him.

220
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,171
There are things you have to keep
to yourself as human.

221
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,175
He doesn't understand the boundaries.

222
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,346
Out of the mouth comes evil.
It describes him perfectly.

223
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,015
He got drunk and missed his gig.

224
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,895
Well...

225
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,773
it may be time for him to retire.

226
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,446
Some say that we should know when to quit.

227
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,930
He was so cool.

228
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,353
I...

229
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,607
used to be a martial artist.

230
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,778
I was very serious about it.

231
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,158
I was pretty good...

232
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,453
but I injured my eye.

233
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,455
Detached retina.

234
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,295
I suddenly lost my purpose in life.

235
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,132
I felt that I was worthless.

236
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,718
I was in terrible shape.

237
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,430
Then...

238
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,475
I met him by accident.

239
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,686
In Asakusa?

240
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,064
Yes. In a bar.

241
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,237
I had no money, or a place to go.
He paid for everything.

242
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,908
When I woke up, I was backstage.

243
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,249
That's when I saw his stand-up
for the first time.

244
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:29,257
Once he got paid after the show,
he said, "let's go out to drink."

245
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,095
I was intrigued by the way
he lived his life.

246
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,557
I suddenly felt so much better.

247
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,186
The next day,
I asked him to let me be his assistant.

248
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,065
Then...

249
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,361
it may be your turn.

250
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,240
For whatever he did for you,

251
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,452
why not return the favor?

252
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,720
Another beer, please.

253
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,054
Sure.

254
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,374
-Mr. Kinzo!
-Listen.

255
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,836
I have less than half a year left.

256
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,591
Let me do you once. Be my last lady.

257
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,594
<i>That's enough!</i>
<i>I'll sue you for sexual harassment.</i>

258
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,972
<i>This is Serao.</i>

259
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,142
<i>We were worried</i>
<i>since he hadn't shown up for a while.</i>

260
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,480
<i>But we started seeing him</i>
<i>on a late-night drama series.</i>

261
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,732
He's good, isn't he?

262
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,777
He's only in one scene
every time, but he's still good.

263
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,863
His character is dying
but is still a sex maniac.

264
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,239
It's perfect for him.

265
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,244
Hello.

266
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,789
-Welcome.
-Here comes a great actor.

267
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,874
-Master comedian!
-Long time no see.

268
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,002
-Master, can I have a corn dog?
-Sure.

269
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,048
-I'll take your coat.
-Thanks.

270
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,766
We were worried about you
since you hadn't come for a while.

271
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,812
Sorry about that.
I've been very busy these days.

272
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,939
We watch your drama every week.

273
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,816
I'm so grateful.

274
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,151
You know that thing?
The bird thing?

275
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,861
-You mean Twitter.
-That's it.

276
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,700
Young fans use that
to comment on my acting.

277
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,453
Some of them even show up
to our comedy theater to see me.

278
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,253
Welcome.

279
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,058
-Beer, please.
-Sure.

280
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,438
Not only fans,

281
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,567
but a movie director
also saw my performance.

282
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,362
He wants me to play a role
in his new movie.

283
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,699
Awesome.
This must be the big break of your career.

284
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,119
I don't want to retire yet.

285
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,289
I must compete with young men

286
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,709
for jobs and women.

287
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:58,966
Here you go.

288
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,597
This is for you.

289
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,349
It's on Serao.

290
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,934
Hey, Master...

291
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,188
I have no reason to treat that jerk.

292
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,900
Well, you do have a reason.

293
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:19,779
Your drama gig...

294
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,657
was set up by Hajime.

295
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,912
You are lucky...

296
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,165
to have such a nice pupil.

297
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,852
Thank you.

298
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,899
Are you big enough
to influence the casting now?

299
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,985
That's not true.
It was just a slip of the tongue.

300
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,781
I'm too old to handle a lot of gigs.

301
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,784
I won't allow you to retire yet.

302
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,744
Are you sure about that?

303
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,914
Soon I will take all the gigs
away from you.

304
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,166
Really? Then try me.

305
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,047
Well, this is enough.
I'll take mercy on you for now.

306
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,554
Once the batter puffs up,
roll it with chopsticks.

307
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,472
That way you can fry it evenly.

308
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,934
The batter is good not just for sweets,

309
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,687
but also some other ingredients.
You should try it.

310
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,604
Here you go.

311
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,191
Deep-fried fish sausage. Bon appétit.

312
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,028
It's so good.

313
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,948
-Can I have some?
-What?

314
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,784
-Just a bite, please.
-No way.

315
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,412
Who do you think you are, asshole?

316
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,080
Good night.

317
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,542
Hey, give me some.

318
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,014
THIS STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION
