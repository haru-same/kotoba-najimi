00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,445
<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>and hurry home,</i>

3
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,242
<i>my day starts.</i>

4
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,311
<i>My diner opens from midnight</i>

5
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,395
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

6
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,983
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,570
PORK MISO SOUP COMBO
BEER, SAKE, SHOCHU

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,697
<i>That's all I have on my menu.</i>

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,783
<i>But I make whatever customers request</i>

10
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,036
<i>as long as I have ingredients for it.</i>

11
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,704
<i>That's my policy.</i>

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,628
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

13
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,254
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

14
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,218
MIDNIGHT DINER
-TOKYO STORIES-

15
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:19,348
SOUR PLUM & PLUM WINE

16
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,826
That's so annoying.

17
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,793
I love this.

18
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,755
-Dark beer?
-It's black cider.

19
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,007
A friend in Toyama sent it to me.

20
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,011
It has a flavor of soy sauce
with a hint of pepper. It's pretty good.

21
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,431
Thank you.

22
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,563
Can you really make a living
by selling these items?

23
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,691
Not so bad.

24
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,445
What do you do during the winter?

25
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,533
I sell some other stuff.

26
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,156
Are you okay, boss?

27
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,616
I'm okay. Thank you.

28
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,042
What was wrong with him?

29
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,587
He didn't look so sharp.

30
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,424
Welcome.

31
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,930
This is unusual.

32
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,015
Here on a week night?

33
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,852
I can't sleep.

34
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,980
Shochu on the rocks, please.

35
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,690
Anything to eat?

36
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,651
Just... sour plum.

37
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,695
Just one?

38
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,239
Two.

39
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,414
Here you go.

40
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,212
Thank you.

41
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,344
<i>Mr. Hoshino owns a produce store</i>
<i>in this neighborhood.</i>

42
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,556
All the vegetables I use here,
I buy from him.

43
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,940
It's just not right.

44
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,108
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,946
You bought this plum
from my store, didn't you?

46
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,824
Yes. It's Nankobai from Kishu.

47
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,247
Even if you use the same plums,
they're just not the same.

48
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,915
What's the matter?

49
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,337
My mother's sour plums finally ran out.

50
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,297
I ate all of them.

51
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,466
I see.

52
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,843
When did she...

53
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,221
pass away?

54
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,514
Almost four years ago.

55
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,517
That long?

56
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,107
I knew they would run out someday
if I kept eating them every day.

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,025
But when I'm drinking alone at home,

58
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,653
I just get awfully lonely.

59
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,822
I can't help eating one, or two.

60
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,869
That's because I lived with my mother
for a long time.

61
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,124
I pickle the plums myself every year.

62
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,878
But they just won't turn out
like my mother's.

63
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,798
Only your mother knows...

64
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,342
just how much salt to use.

65
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,721
The perfect amount.

66
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,639
It's very important.

67
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:38,148
When the sour plums ran out,
it really sank in that she was gone.

68
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,319
That I really am alone now.

69
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,532
These days...

70
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,328
I feel that time passes faster
than before.

71
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,336
Master,

72
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,253
just one more.

73
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,882
Are you sure?
You must wake up early tomorrow.

74
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,842
Yes. Wake up at 4:30.

75
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,733
Here you go.

76
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,195
I heard the produce store owner
was hospitalized.

77
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,656
Early stage diabetes.

78
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,367
He has to be in the hospital
for two weeks.

79
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,702
-Did you pay him a visit?
-Yeah.

80
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,497
The owner of Kotodama
knew his hospital.

81
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,416
Since his mother passed away,

82
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,794
I bet he didn't eat too well.

83
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,838
He never helped with chores.

84
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,802
He said he feels like he's paying
for all the time he was being lazy now.

85
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,846
Take care.

86
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,228
Mr. Hoshino.

87
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,814
Done with today's tests?

88
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,317
Mr. Hoshino?

89
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,948
An elderly woman always sat there
at this time of the day.

90
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,575
Why isn't she here today?

91
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,705
I think she is discharged
from the hospital.

92
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,682
Why do we eat <i>tokoroten</i> with a chopstick?

93
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,684
Is this some kind of superstition?

94
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,436
I'm not sure,

95
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,064
but this is supposed to be
the most fashionable way to eat it.

96
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,316
In the old days,

97
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,570
they ate it with a long toothpick
like eating sweets.

98
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,406
In Kansai Region,

99
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,241
they eat it with brown sugar syrup.

100
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,579
Welcome.

101
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,164
Hello.

102
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,668
Master, thank you for visiting me
at the hospital.

103
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,255
We all were worried about you.
How's your diabetes?

104
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,424
It's under control.

105
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,054
But recently I can't sleep well.

106
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,598
It has been extremely hot, that's why.

107
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,266
Well, that's one reason, but...

108
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,063
You see someone die in the hospital
every day.

109
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,650
I couldn't help thinking about myself
at night and got uneasy.

110
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,737
I have no family.

111
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,157
I must wonder who will take care
of my stuff after I die.

112
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,076
When we die, we die.

113
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,870
There is no point in worrying about
what happens afterwards.

114
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,997
Why don't you get married?

115
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,416
Find someone who is tough enough
to outlive you.

116
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,296
-I can't take this.
-What are you talking about?

117
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,674
After I die...

118
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,720
all the porn DVDs I have stored away
will be found.

119
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,140
Then throw them away.
You are not a teenager anymore.

120
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,102
That's not easy.

121
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,603
Some are very rare items.

122
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,274
Listen Master,

123
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,694
if you came to my store
and found me dead,

124
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,115
will you sneak into my house

125
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,574
and throw them away secretly?

126
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,326
What?

127
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,579
You're single, too.
You understand, right?

128
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,750
Let's conclude a gentlemen's agreement.

129
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,420
Master,

130
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,674
please. I beg you.

131
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,800
That's stupid.

132
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,055
You can't get rid of your worldly passions
until you die, huh?

133
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,369
<i>Please open it.</i>

134
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,126
Who are you?

135
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,547
<i>Please open it.</i>

136
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,177
<i>Please let me in.</i>

137
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,016
<i>Yoichi...</i>

138
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,518
Mother?

139
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,312
<i>Please open it.</i>

140
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,566
Yoichi...

141
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,529
please let me in.

142
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,283
Mother,

143
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,577
you are dead.

144
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,499
I'm dead. That's why I'm asking you.

145
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,255
Please let me in.

146
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,257
Please.

147
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,385
Mother,

148
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,597
please rest in peace.

149
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,808
Excuse me.

150
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,812
Excuse me.

151
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,735
Yes.

152
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,279
I will take this.

153
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,286
Isn't it damaged?

154
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,541
Okay. This one, huh?

155
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,966
Every night in the last few days,

156
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,259
while I am asleep,

157
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,595
my dead mother comes and calls me.

158
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,847
"Please open it."

159
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,058
"Please let me in."

160
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,393
She talks to me.

161
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,813
Boss, it must be your dream.

162
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,776
As I cover myself with the blanket
and recite Buddhist scriptures,

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,862
she becomes sad and says,

164
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,366
"Please let me in.

165
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,785
"I forgot something."

166
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,912
Forgot something?

167
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,749
She may be still keeping
her secret savings.

168
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,794
I agree. She is worried about it.

169
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,629
I don't think so.

170
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,508
She put her entire fortune in a bag
and gave it to me

171
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,219
before she died.

172
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,014
Why don't you let her in?

173
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,182
But...

174
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,060
Even if she is my mother,

175
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,270
she is a ghost.

176
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,940
There is a line that shouldn't be crossed.

177
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,279
-Good evening.
-Welcome.

178
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,867
I thought that it might be ready.

179
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,038
-I mean your plum wine.
-You are right.

180
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,373
-Your plum wine?
-Yes.

181
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,293
I make a big bottle of it every year.

182
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,712
Summer is hot and I don't like it.

183
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,505
But I can enjoy his plum wine.

184
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,343
Who wants some? It's been aged
for a year. A perfect time to drink it.

185
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,844
Yes!

186
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,144
-Is your heart okay?
-It's not working.

187
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,481
So she is worried about this, huh?

188
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,194
My mother also made plum wine
whenever she salted plums.

189
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,738
She loved it.

190
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,408
I thought that she had finished it all.

191
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,412
-Want a glass?
-No, thanks.

192
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,708
-I don't want to upset your mother.
-Don't worry.

193
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,670
I offered a glass of it at the altar.
Besides...

194
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,007
today is the anniversary
of my mother's death.

195
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,593
Please have some in her memory.

196
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,637
Okay.

197
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,223
I'll have just one glass.

198
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,684
Then me, too.

199
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,145
Then can I have, too?

200
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,565
I love Master's,

201
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,695
this one is also flavorful,
but mild at the same time.

202
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>That's how</i>

203
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,034
<i>they consumed all of it</i>
<i>after making an excuse.</i>

204
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,702
<i>On that night...</i>

205
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,790
<i>Yoichi...</i>

206
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,212
Yoichi...

207
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,969
Yoichi...

208
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,932
So it wasn't the plum wine?

209
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,958
If it's not the plum wine,
then what else could it be?

210
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,798
His mother wants to take him.

211
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,843
If he crosses the Styx, he will be dead.

212
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,471
What are you talking about?

213
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,765
We're talking about
the produce store owner.

214
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,895
A spirit of his dead mother
shows up every night

215
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,646
and he can't sleep.

216
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,901
I see. Does she have something to regret?

217
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,611
We can't figure it out.

218
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,616
Because of my trade,
I've seen a lot of ways to die.

219
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,702
Die happily with nothing to regret?

220
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,788
It's rare. Many have something to regret.

221
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,292
But you all sound very unscientific.

222
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,171
She forgot something
and wants to come in, right?

223
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,924
Then it must be in the house.

224
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,635
If that's the case,

225
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,179
he should search the house thoroughly.

226
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,140
-But that's not easy to do.
-Yes.

227
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,937
Wait. We have a professional
household searcher here.

228
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,270
Without libido, we are no longer men.

229
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,647
But at the same time,
it's a hassle having it.

230
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,067
It's not easy being a man.

231
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,903
This one is as precious
as a national treasure.

232
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,574
Wait.

233
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,952
What is this?

234
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,832
And found something?

235
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,257
What is it?

236
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,518
What the--?

237
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,772
Shunga<i>, another name for</i>
Ukiyoe <i>artwork on human Eros.</i>

238
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,024
<i>Also called Funny Pictures,</i>

239
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,985
<i>used as a talisman</i>
<i>to protect someone from evil.</i>

240
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,989
<i>In the old custom, it was given</i>
<i>to a bride as an educational material</i>

241
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,075
<i>to prevent her from being surprised</i>
<i>on her bridal night.</i>

242
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,333
I think my mother brought these
with her when she got married.

243
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,754
This must be it.

244
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,426
As soon as we found them, I took them
to our family temple for the service.

245
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,720
Then her ghost never came back.

246
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:04,602
Why did she remember them now
long after her death?

247
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,106
That's because her son was worried
about his porn DVDs.

248
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,776
That must have
reminded her about her own.

249
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,905
My mother is like me.

250
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,990
She can't throw away anything.

251
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,825
It's our frugal mentality.

252
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,828
She was worried about you.

253
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,000
Your mother.
She saw you acting so lonely.

254
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,379
So, she came back
to urge you to find someone.

255
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,799
Whether she is in the afterlife
or in this world,

256
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,425
she is your parent.

257
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,052
And you are always her son.

258
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,768
Have a drink, everyone.

259
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,813
It's on me today.

260
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,649
Lucky us.

261
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,998
Hello.

262
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,417
Welcome.

263
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,169
You look great.

264
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,173
Luckily, yes.

265
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,176
I'm Okubo, the nurse.

266
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,390
Right. Thank you for taking care of me.

267
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,394
I didn't recognize you
without your nurse uniform.

268
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,478
People tell me that a lot.

269
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,690
How are you feeling?

270
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,611
As you can see, I've gotten much better
like I was born a new person.

271
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,033
What brings you here today?

272
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,369
I wanted to see your store.

273
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,206
Really? All the way to see the store?

274
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,585
I have been worried about you.

275
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,216
What do you recommend?

276
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,140
Right. How about some okra?

277
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,768
-Give me one.
-Just one?

278
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,103
-Then two.
-Two.

279
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,113
Here you go.

280
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,911
Salt determines the flavor of sour plum.

281
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,955
If you use coarse salt with bittern,

282
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,668
not table salt, it enhances
the umami flavor in the plum.

283
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,923
The plums in plum wine can be
eaten as is.

284
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,926
You can also make jam and jelly out of it.

285
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,011
That's it.

286
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,264
Good night.

287
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,771
<i>Yoichi...</i>

288
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,941
You can rest in peace now.

289
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,194
I've found someone special.

290
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,238
Nice to meet you.

291
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,657
I will take care of his health.

292
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,868
I will take over making sour plums.

293
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,621
And...

294
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
I'll take good care of 
your <i>Shunga</i>. Mother.

295
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,176
-Rest in peace.
-Rest in peace.

296
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:53,849
THIS STORY IS FICTION
