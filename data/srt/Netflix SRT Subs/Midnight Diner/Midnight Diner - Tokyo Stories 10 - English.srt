1
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,905
<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>and hurry home,</i>

3
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>my day starts.</i>

4
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,438
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

5
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

6
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,110
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,614
PORK MISO SOUP COMBO
BEER, SAKE, SHOCHU

8
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>That's all I have on my menu.</i>

9
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,869
<i>But I'll make whatever customers request</i>

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,163
<i>as long as I have the ingredients for it.</i>

11
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>That's my policy.</i>

12
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,171
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

13
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,465
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

14
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,138
Midnight Diner:
Tokyo Stories

15
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,850
NEW YEAR'S EVE NOODLES, AGAIN

16
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,192
<i>Before I know it, a year has passed.</i>

17
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>Another New Year's Eve is here.</i>

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,911
If you have six wins and four losses,
I call it a good life.

19
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,704
Some great mind said so.

20
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,331
Cheer up.

21
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,001
Stop looking so miserable.

22
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,170
It makes me feel cold.

23
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,298
My empty wallet makes me feel frozen.

24
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,635
There are hot days and cold days.

25
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,512
Feels like the middle of the desert.

26
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,516
A good day is followed by a bad day.

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,684
It's a rule of the universe.

28
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,232
In the spring, the god of horse racing

29
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,859
brought me a stroke of good fortune

30
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,946
with cherry blossoms.

31
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,657
Then winter came.

32
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,910
My good fortune melted as it snowed.

33
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,956
You're not a good gambler anyway.

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,583
Here you go.

35
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,503
Listen,
at least you had a good dream.

36
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,631
But that caused Master trouble.

37
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,049
What?

38
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:44,182
Okay. Good. Keep moving.

39
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,476
Hey, careful.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>That was like a sweet dream</i>
<i>on a warm spring day.</i>

41
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,440
This is fine here.

42
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,863
-Clear.
-Come in.

43
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,490
Welcome.

44
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,119
Master, I did it.

45
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,496
A million... A million...

46
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,331
You disappoint me, Komichi.

47
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,711
-You stole money? A million?
-A million.

48
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,256
He bet on a dark horse
at the Emperor Cup.

49
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,141
I was going to bet
on the odds-on favorite,

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,268
but I bet on the dark horse by mistake.

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,023
At the beginning of the race,
the top horse fell down

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,400
and caused a big mess.
The dark horse survived and won.

53
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:41,072
-I'm so scared of my great fortune.
-Congratulations.

54
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,867
Do anything you want with that.

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,329
I've never seen or earned
such a large amount of money.

56
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,914
I don't know what to do.

57
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,917
At the very least,
let me treat you all tonight.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,001
No.

59
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,214
-Thanks, but we have to go now.
-Why?

60
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,716
We escorted him here.
Let's eat with his money.

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,885
-She's right.
-That's inappropriate.

62
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,013
We're detectives.
We're public servants.

63
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,391
-It's a sign of our friendship, right?
-Of course, it's about friendship.

64
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,769
It's...

65
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,854
There is no conflict of interest.

66
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,900
It's based on an intimate relationship,
one in which we care for each other.

67
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,736
-It's a beautiful...
-Friendship.

68
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,780
If so, what would you do?

69
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,034
If so, we should accept it.

70
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,620
As a matter of courtesy.

71
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,916
Master, serve them anything they want.

72
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,252
-I want sushi.
-Wait.

73
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,629
If you want sushi,
you should go somewhere else.

74
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,547
But...

75
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,716
I wish to share the joy

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,969
with everyone at your diner.

77
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,518
Tonight's mixer was as pathetic as usual.

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,895
All the men talk like feminists,

79
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,941
but at the bottoms of their hearts
they think a woman is an ornament.

80
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,485
Even in the 21st century,
nothing has changed.

81
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,486
Fine!

82
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,780
I will never marry.

83
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,242
Here comes Greater amberjack.

84
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
What's going on?

85
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,835
Komichi won big on a horse race.

86
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,837
So, he's treating everyone to sushi.

87
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,047
Please join us.

88
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,675
Really? Can we?

89
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,554
You can eat anything you want, yes.
Everyone else, eat some more.

90
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,764
-I'll have fatty tuna.
-Give me salmon roe.

91
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,849
Coming right up.

92
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,315
Mater, I'm sorry...

93
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,400
about the big party.

94
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,987
-This is an exception, okay?
-I know.

95
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,540
<i>It was the biggest event</i>
<i>among us this spring.</i>

96
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>In the summer,</i>
<i>we had a rare incident.</i>

97
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,509
-The best summer food is watermelon.
-I agree.

98
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,473
It'd be perfect
if we had anti-mosquito incense.

99
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,516
I have the incense.

100
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,771
Thank you for the salt.

101
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,773
Here you go.

102
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,486
This is it. It completes
a perfect Japanese summer.

103
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,375
What?

104
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,003
Are those the power-generating
wind bells?

105
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,506
That's pretty.

106
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,053
Boss.

107
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,180
Relax.

108
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,974
Maybe a wire shorted out.

109
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,268
I wonder if our bar is okay.

110
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,521
It's not an earthquake.

111
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,356
I'm sure it won't last long.

112
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,901
We'll make it through a while
with candles.

113
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,664
What can I say?

114
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,835
This is like a horror night.

115
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,338
Don't say that. I love horror stories.

116
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,175
Can anyone tell a scary story?

117
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,679
I don't know if it's scary or not.

118
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,806
But a watermelon reminds me
of something.

119
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,057
Want to hear it?

120
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,726
Sure.

121
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,563
This is what happened to

122
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,565
my grandfather.

123
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,819
On a summer night 60 years ago,

124
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,280
it was around this same time,

125
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,867
my grandfather was having a drink
at his colleague's place

126
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,452
where he lived alone.

127
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,495
It was hot and humid.

128
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,249
They ran out of liquor and food.
They were so thirsty.

129
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,961
So, the colleague said,
"Let's go get a watermelon."

130
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,963
Steal a watermelon?

131
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,010
They were so drunk,
they entered a watermelon field.

132
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,180
They each stole one,

133
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,724
then headed back to the house
along a railway track.

134
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,560
They stumbled upon a graveyard,

135
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,439
which they hadn't seen
when they entered the field.

136
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,817
"I didn't know there was a graveyard."

137
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:32,572
When they came to a halt,
a bright light appeared out of the blue.

138
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,201
A train was not supposed to run that late,
but there was one coming.

139
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,080
When my grandfather came to, he found
himself on the ground near the track.

140
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,791
He must have reacted
and jumped away from the train.

141
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,711
But he couldn't find his colleague.
No streetlights. It was pitch-black.

142
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,883
He called, but got no answer. He thought
that the colleague left without him.

143
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,512
So, my grandfather made his way
back to his colleague's house

144
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,472
with the watermelon,
which was not damaged.

145
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,726
When he tried to wash the watermelon,
he realized that...

146
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,436
it was not a watermelon

147
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,148
but the bloody head of his friend.

148
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,293
Are you okay?

149
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,047
-Ryu, are you okay?
-I got this as a gift.

150
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,924
I wanted to share it with you all.

151
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,843
Ryu...

152
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,733
Hey, boss.

153
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,237
<i>Ever since that night,</i>

154
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,739
<i>Ryu has been unable to eat watermelon.</i>

155
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,284
<i>Poor Ryu.</i>

156
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>Autumn is the harvest season.</i>

157
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,171
<i>Autumn is also the season of love.</i>

158
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,756
<i>As it gets colder,</i>

159
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,134
<i>you feel the need for company.</i>

160
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,219
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

161
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,888
My mouth's watering.

162
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,806
I will eat it.

163
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,809
It's can't be...

164
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,305
A crime? It must be a crime.

165
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,516
It could be an accident.

166
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,769
It could be both.

167
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,897
So, I have to go.
That's right. I have to go.

168
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,359
Hello?

169
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>Then another winter came.</i>

170
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,908
<i>A year is about to end.</i>

171
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,624
Kasumi.

172
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,295
Are you going back to work?

173
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,382
This is a busy time of year.

174
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,384
You should grab a good fortune.

175
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,261
-Have a happy new year!
-You, too.

176
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,062
Spring will come again after winter.

177
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,148
I can't keep losing forever.

178
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,777
I'll do everything I can to have
a good fortune next year.

179
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,446
Good attitude. Have a drink.

180
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,907
Forget all the failures.

181
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,283
Thank you for the drink.

182
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,247
-Good evening.
-Welcome.

183
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,167
I knew you'd all be here.

184
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,380
How pathetic. It's New Year's Eve.

185
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,298
You don't have anywhere else to go?

186
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,093
That's right. And neither do you.

187
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,678
Buckwheat noodles?

188
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,139
-Of course.
-Extra large, please.

189
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,140
Sure.

190
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,690
-Hello.
-Welcome.

191
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,900
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

192
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,292
It's so delicious.

193
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,379
I'm so glad to eat noodles
before the new year arrives.

194
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,133
After midnight, you can no longer
call it "New Year's Eve noodles."

195
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,178
In some regions, they say
that it will bring you bad luck

196
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,680
if you eat noodles after midnight.

197
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,767
-Is that so?
-You know a lot, huh?

198
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,436
-I got all from Wiki.
-Wiki?

199
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,897
Is that some kind of monkey?

200
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,026
It's Wikipedia.

201
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,652
Pedia?

202
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,656
The sound of the word tells me
that it has nothing to do with me.

203
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,164
-Hello.
-Welcome.

204
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,416
What's that?

205
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,878
We're going to Hawaii
on an early morning flight.

206
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,589
New Year's Day in Hawaii?

207
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,467
I thought that Saipan
was good enough, but...

208
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,261
I wanted to be like a celebrity in Hawaii.

209
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,722
So, we're here to drink
until the flight leaves.

210
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,142
-But before that...
-Master.

211
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,269
Buckwheat noodles!

212
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,938
Sure.

213
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,778
I wonder why we started eating
buckwheat noodles on New Year's Eve.

214
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,823
-A noodle store conspiracy?
-Buckwheat noodles

215
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,409
are easier to cut off
than other noodles.

216
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,579
So, we eat it to cut off
"misfortunes and disasters of the year."

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,499
This practice was established
during Edo period.

218
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,043
-You're very knowledgeable, huh?
-I got it from Wikipedia.

219
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,798
It means that we shouldn't eat
chewy noodles like ramen?

220
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,093
It's not easy to be cut off, huh?

221
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,268
-Ryu!
-We escorted it.

222
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,356
-Good evening.
-Wow, New Year's food.

223
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,538
You are a slow eater as usual.

224
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,001
If I eat quickly, I get heartburns.
I must be getting old, huh?

225
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,881
Seems like the last New Year's Day
was yesterday.

226
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,134
Before I know it, a year has passed.

227
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,053
It gets faster once you turn 30.

228
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,389
-Be prepared.
-I'm already in my 30s.

229
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,600
I knew that.

230
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,648
Nothing special happened this year.

231
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,486
You should know better.

232
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,198
"Nothing special happened."
It means peace.

233
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,995
We should appreciate it
if we have nothing special.

234
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,330
That's right.

235
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,832
Five.

236
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,375
Four.

237
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,378
Three. Two.

238
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,255
One.

239
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,675
Happy new year.

240
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,470
I wish you all the best
in this new year.

241
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,058
-Then...
-Stop it. No alcohol.

242
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,645
Let's have this. Soba stock.

243
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,201
Happy new year.

244
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,134
Master?

245
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,763
The mistress will be a little late.

246
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,703
<i>When people finish their day</i>

247
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
<i>and hurry home,</i>

248
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,000
<i>my day starts.</i>

249
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,962
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

250
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

251
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,634
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

252
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,598
Bye, Master. I look forward
to your goodwill in the new year.

253
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,310
-Bye.
-Have a great trip.

254
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,313
-Bye.
-Bye.

255
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,490
I hope it goes well.

256
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,580
Michiru, what do you want for a souvenir?

257
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:43,998
Come talk.

258
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,256
Did you say
that there was a new Hawaiian pub?

259
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,027
Happy new year.

260
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,915
Thank you for helping me clean dishes.

261
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,875
You're welcome.

262
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,710
It was a busy day, so you need help.

263
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,424
Master, you are a lucky man.

264
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,803
You have so many great customers.

265
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,430
You're right.

266
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,437
-You attract them.
-No.

267
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,316
I just open the diner
at the same time every day,

268
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,777
make whatever they want,

269
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,571
and close the diner
at the same time every day.

270
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,366
-That's all.
-Sounds like a great diner.

271
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,494
Hey,

272
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,624
care to make the first shrine visit
of the new year with me?

273
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,839
Sorry.

274
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,844
I was planning to do
a general house cleaning today.

275
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,515
I see.

276
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,021
I understand.

277
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,202
I look forward to your continued
goodwill in the new year.

278
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:48,873
You, too.

279
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,891
THIS STORY IS FICTION
