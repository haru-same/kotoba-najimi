00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,356
<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>and hurry home,</i>

3
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,820
<i>my day starts.</i>

4
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

5
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,259
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

6
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,227
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

8
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,855
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

9
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,653
Midnight Diner:
Tokyo Stories

10
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,240
HAM CUTLET

11
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,119
Let's eat.

12
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,046
<i>It was Mr. Nakatsuka's first time</i>
<i>at my diner.</i>

13
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,301
<i>He ate ham cutlets so fondly</i>
<i>that he made a strong impression.</i>

14
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,430
You make my mouth water.

15
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,934
This is how ham cutlets
are supposed to be.

16
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,937
The ham should be thin,
but the batter should be thick.

17
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,483
These days many restaurants use
a thick slice of ham.

18
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,609
Am I right?

19
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,364
I've ordered it at a Western restaurant,
but I was so shocked.

20
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,658
Their ham was so thick.

21
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,868
And it was very high quality.

22
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,542
Played with your little brother, huh?

23
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,837
If you lost at Othello,

24
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,173
you had to go out
and buy two ham cutlets.

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,509
Have some more.

26
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,053
I don't have any brothers,

27
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,596
so I envy you.

28
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,183
Well, he's not a real brother.

29
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,601
What?

30
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,356
My brother is the son
of my father's second wife.

31
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,569
We were only brothers for four years
until they got divorced.

32
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,531
I was still in elementary school.

33
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,033
It was several decades ago.

34
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,537
Were you close, despite that?

35
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,958
He was hot-tempered
but very friendly at the same time.

36
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,502
He was so sweet.

37
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,714
It was so tough

38
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,298
when we were separated.

39
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,677
It's a good story.
Don't you think, Master?

40
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,347
And where is your brother now?

41
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,226
After our parents were divorced,
I lost track of him.

42
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,272
Unfortunately,
I haven't seen him for decades.

43
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,113
-Hello.
-Welcome.

44
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,865
Beer for starters.

45
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,283
Sure.

46
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,745
Hey, Master.

47
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,455
I think you can tell

48
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,207
someone's true character
if you see how he departs.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,209
Here you go.

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,962
What happened?

51
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,506
My friend is getting a divorce.

52
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,885
They're having an ugly fight
over their pet rabbit.

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,971
-Dumping it onto each other?
-No, the opposite.

54
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,639
Both want to keep it.

55
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,018
-Sounds like a kid.
-I know.

56
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,895
They're holding their ground.

57
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,940
According to law,
a pet is considered property.

58
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,195
Whoever keeps the pet has
to relinquish other property

59
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,155
or give money to the other person.

60
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,324
That's how most cases are settled.

61
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,910
Really? I didn't know that.

62
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,038
Sorry to jump in your conversation.

63
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,582
I'm...

64
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,584
Nakatsuka.

65
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,879
ATTORNEY
YUKIO NAKATSUKA

66
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,255
You're an attorney?

67
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,887
Your office is in this area?

68
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,431
Has it been there for a long time?

69
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,975
Yes. For 35 years.

70
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,769
Thirty-five years? Wow?

71
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,815
But I'll be closing the office next month.

72
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,608
May I ask why?

73
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,779
Because times have changed.

74
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,908
"Old soldiers just fade away."

75
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,712
<i>In a municipally-owned apartment</i>
<i>that will be torn down next January,</i>

76
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,257
<i>government officials tried to convince</i>

77
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,344
<i>a resident who refuses to leave</i>
<i>to come to the negotiating table.</i>

78
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,270
<i>Mr. Ishibashi. Please. Mr. Ishibashi.</i>

79
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,521
<i>Please.</i>

80
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855
<i>Go away!</i>

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,693
<i>Calm down, Mr. Ishibashi, please.</i>

82
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,946
<i>This is my home.</i>

83
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:08,535
<i>My late mother and I worked so hard</i>
<i>to keep it.</i>

84
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:13,456
<i>Nobody can take it away from me.</i>

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,294
<i>Government officials said</i>
<i>that demolition work will start soon--</i>

86
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,381
I've sorted out
all the financial documents.

87
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,593
Take a look at the rest to decide
which ones you keep at home

88
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,636
and which ones you dispose of.

89
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,098
Sure.

90
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,561
<i>Administrative subrogation could be</i>
<i>an option--</i>

91
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,857
<i>Go away!</i>

92
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,401
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for coming.

93
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,241
I saw that on the evening news.

94
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,078
The government will appeal
to administrative subrogation.

95
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
It's just a matter of time.

96
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,123
I guess so.

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,961
To build the Olympic stadium,

99
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,048
they have to demolish
an old municipally-owned apartment.

100
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,176
An old man refuses to leave
and is causing trouble.

101
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,969
Chu, you hadn't heard?

102
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,015
The old man is obnoxious and curses
down at the government officials.

103
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,726
No electricity, no gas.
Yet he stays there by himself.

104
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,479
But it's a municipally-owned apartment,
right?

105
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,564
He doesn't own the property.

106
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,609
He has to leave sooner or later.

107
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,070
It must be a special place to him.

108
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,656
Don't you feel any sympathy?

109
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,325
-I have, but...
-Here you go.

110
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,285
-Enjoy your ham cutlets.
-Thank you.

111
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
Ham cutlet, huh?
It's a good old-fashioned dish.

112
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,211
I often ate it at a local butcher's shop
when I was a kid.

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,130
The community was tight back then.

114
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,091
It was the good old days.

115
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,552
Come on, Chu. Don't be so nostalgic.

116
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,514
You're too young to understand.

117
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,308
If you glorify the past,

118
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,813
you won't be happy with the present
and the future, which are more important.

119
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,691
You're right.

120
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,985
The young lady is absolutely right.

121
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,446
Young lady?

122
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,038
<i>People finish their day</i>

123
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,415
<i>and hurry home.</i>

124
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,462
<i>But sometimes they don't want</i>
<i>to go straight back home,</i>

125
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,423
<i>so they drop in somewhere</i>
<i>on the way home.</i>

126
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,342
Have some.

127
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,261
Thank you.

128
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,430
I don't mean it.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,182
You gave me a whole melon,

130
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,350
but I can't finish it by myself.

131
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,867
I've run a small law office by myself.

132
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,953
I believe that I worked hard,

133
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,583
but the number of my clients
has declined drastically.

134
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,878
You've worked for 35 years.

135
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,755
It's an accomplishment.

136
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,217
I started the firm with my wife.

137
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,761
Two years ago,

138
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,763
I lost her.

139
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:02,477
I think I may have lost my passion
after that.

140
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,106
Would you like ham cutlet?

141
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,149
Wait.

142
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,943
Not tonight.

143
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,611
I see.

144
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,029
An unusual day, huh?

145
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,284
I've found my little brother.

146
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,745
Really?

147
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm happy for you.

148
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,291
He actually lives nearby.

149
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,711
-Really? Then--
-No.

150
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,631
I've wanted to see him so badly,

151
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,759
but I got intimidated
when the moment arrived.

152
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,595
Why?

153
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,597
The other day,

154
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,142
I talked about the game Othello, right?

155
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,518
Yeah.

156
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,021
You played against your brother
for ham cutlets.

157
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,483
I always won

158
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,737
and made my brother pay
for ham cutlets.

159
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,700
He ran out of his allowance

160
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,952
and extorted money

161
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,663
from his classmate.

162
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,792
When the school found out,

163
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,878
he was questioned.

164
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,591
But he didn't say anything
about our game.

165
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,886
He protected me.

166
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,263
I guess...

167
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,518
he didn't want to upset
his newly-acquired big brother.

168
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,774
My father hit him so hard

169
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,111
as punishment.

170
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,156
I felt so guilty.

171
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,033
It was my fault.

172
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,537
I watched silently as my brother...

173
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,123
was beaten.

174
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,921
I was scared of my father.

175
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,883
I was afraid that he might abandon me.

176
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,218
Just like my real mother.

177
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,973
My little brother...

178
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,684
smiled at me

179
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,728
when my eyes met his,

180
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,480
as he was being beaten.

181
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,149
He was saying:

182
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,151
"I'm okay."

183
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,075
You can't shake the guilty feeling, huh?

184
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,243
Well...

185
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,663
my remorse is

186
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,248
like a hangnail, nothing too serious.

187
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,880
They say...

188
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,632
that you might get tetanus

189
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,593
if you don't treat the hangnail.

190
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:48,935
Go away!

191
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,729
Go away, asshole!

192
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,981
Please do not upset him.

193
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,148
Go away!

194
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,277
Let's discuss it over there.

195
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,915
Who the hell are you?

196
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,128
If you don't go, you'll get wet.

197
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,045
Kenta.

198
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,260
It's me.

199
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,931
Long time, no see.

200
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,187
Big brother?

201
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,867
Really? You're a lawyer, huh?

202
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,618
I'm proud of you.

203
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,038
I failed the bar exam so many times,

204
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,123
you shouldn't be proud.

205
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,209
-Here you go.
-Just like the good old days.

206
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,378
Let's eat.

207
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,307
It's delicious.

208
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,983
How long are you planning to stay there?

209
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,322
Why do you ask?

210
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,784
The electricity and gas
were already cut off.

211
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,286
How can you survive?

212
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,498
Leave me alone.

213
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,208
It's none of your business.

214
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,961
They will start the demolition soon.

215
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,922
They will...

216
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,800
remove you by force.

217
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,636
Go ahead. I'm not worried.

218
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,223
Even if my body is ripped
by a power shovel,

219
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,766
I won't leave that place.

220
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,269
You're still so stubborn, huh?

221
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,942
Is this...?

222
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,236
It's the one we played with.

223
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:04,904
I kept it.

224
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,908
Master, you don't mind if I open it here?

225
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,036
Not at all.

226
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,669
What do you think? Want to play?

227
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,965
Play for what?

228
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,467
If you win,

229
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,387
I will buy
as many ham cutlets as you want.

230
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,013
And beer.

231
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,142
If I win,

232
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,686
you must leave the apartment.

233
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,155
It is not the best place
for you to live anymore.

234
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,078
Fine. Then I'll beat you.

235
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,621
Brother,

236
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,748
I'm better now.

237
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,668
We shall see.

238
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:11,012
When I grow up, I'll be rich
and build a huge house.

239
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,638
And live with Mom.

240
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,474
Brother, you can live with me.

241
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,018
Dad can't, because he beats Mom.

242
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,412
Good. I won. Go and buy the usual ones.

243
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,707
Give me another chance.
If I lose again, then I'll buy.

244
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,960
-Please.
-No. Crying won't erase your loss.

245
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,796
Fine. I go and buy it, right?

246
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,882
I'll win the next one anyway.

247
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,927
This one... and this one.

248
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,724
Is the house we used to live in
still there?

249
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,935
No. It's gone.

250
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,854
A tall building stands there now.

251
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,689
I see.

252
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
Why is that apartment
so important to you?

253
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,448
I've lived there for most of my life.

254
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,159
Mother died there.

255
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,119
I'll die there, too.

256
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,206
You haven't changed much.

257
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,584
You have no strategy
for playing this game.

258
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm not interested in a tiny victory.

259
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,259
I still have a chance
to come from behind to win.

260
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,768
Oh, no...

261
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,312
Here you go.

262
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,127
Do I have to pass?

263
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,258
Look.

264
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,394
I lost.

265
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,899
What's wrong with you, brother?

266
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,776
You've lost it in your old age, huh?

267
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,822
Master, beer, please.

268
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,490
-Two bottles.
-Sure.

269
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,620
Don't be bothered. I'll get them myself.

270
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,291
Let me open the bottle.

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,835
Master, would you like some beer?

272
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,087
-What do you say?
-But...

273
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,923
-Go ahead.
-I'm really sorry.

274
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,635
You can't do that.

275
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,387
"Crying won't erase your loss."
You always said that.

276
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,558
I just watched
while my father beat you up.

277
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,976
I'm so sorry.

278
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,526
It was a long time ago.
I forgot about it.

279
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,197
I will negotiate with the government

280
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,074
and get you the best compensation

281
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,117
in return for vacating the apartment.

282
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm a lawyer.

283
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,205
Let me do what I can.

284
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,707
Come on. I won.

285
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,834
That's not what we agreed on.

286
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,128
I've already found a new place for you.

287
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,048
It's smaller than your current place,

288
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,550
but it's tidy and has good sunlight.

289
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,968
And the rent is cheap.

290
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,555
If you don't like it, I can find another.

291
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,643
Or you can live with me...

292
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,522
if you don't mind.

293
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,857
I have an extra room anyway.

294
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,735
Both of us are single.

295
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,447
It'll be nice for us to spend
a quiet post-retirement life together.

296
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,367
We can play Othello once in a while.

297
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,119
Idiot!

298
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,378
Don't spoil me.

299
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,720
Just think about it.

300
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,570
-See you later.
-Thank you.

301
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,488
-Bye.
-Hey, brother.

302
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,456
<i>After that,</i>

303
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,209
<i>Mr. Nakatsuka negotiated</i>
<i>with the government</i>

304
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,421
<i>and brought both sides to terms</i>
<i>on how to solve the issue.</i>

305
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:00,301
<i>His brother finally agreed</i>
<i>to leave the apartment.</i>

306
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:28,996
That means...

307
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,001
I was preparing to live with him
at my place.

308
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,004
But he wanted to take
the biggest gamble of his life

309
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,050
with the compensation money
for his forced removal.

310
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,765
And he won big at a casino

311
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,100
and bought a mansion
with a pool overseas.

312
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,519
Unbelievable.

313
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,479
He wants...

314
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,817
me to go over there
and live with him.

315
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,568
Are you going?

316
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,155
-Hello.
-Welcome.

317
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,075
Mr. Nakatsuka, regarding the case
I talked to you about the other day...

318
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,577
I have some information here.

319
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,121
My friend has a personal debt issue

320
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,165
and I want to ask Mr. Nakatsuka
for advice.

321
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:18,254
Even though I closed the office,
I still have a license.

322
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,423
I can still work.

323
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,012
Let's see...

324
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,848
This document is here.

325
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,726
This is a table of contents.

326
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,646
<i>Both of you have a good look.</i>

327
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,948
<i>When you make ham cutlets,</i>

328
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,368
<i>most importantly, make sure</i>
<i>that the flour doesn't get lumpy.</i>

329
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,830
<i>Coat it with bread crumbs evenly</i>
<i>and firmly.</i>

330
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,206
Here you go.

331
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,044
What's the best strategy to win?

332
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,462
I don't know.

333
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,974
THIS STORY IS FICTION
