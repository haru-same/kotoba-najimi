<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,778
<i>my day starts.</i>

3
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,257
<i>My diner opens from midnight</i>

00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,175

5
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

6
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,227
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

7
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,771
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

MIDNIGHT DINER
-TOKYO STORIES-

9
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,073
EGG TOFU

10
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,785
Did you play with him?

11
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,495
Just two rounds.

12
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,999
He took all the money I had won
from a pinball game.

13
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,961
If he is that good,
couldn't he make a lot of money?

14
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,214
Would you play Mahjong
against such a good player?

15
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,343
Of course not,
if I already know that I'll lose.

16
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,469
Exactly.

17
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,307
Speak of the devil.

18
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,267
Welcome back.

19
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,980
I feel at home in Shinjuku.

20
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,441
Thanks for last night.

21
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,402
Take it as my gift to you
for your first return in a year.

22
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,029
You are a veteran gambler.

23
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,325
Come in, or I'll abandon you.

24
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,500
Is that your kid?

25
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,755
Master, can I have "it"?

26
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,091
And for him...

27
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,802
Here you go.

28
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,431
<i>A Mahjong gambler, Mr. Ogami</i>

29
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,767
<i>loves egg tofu.</i>

30
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,937
<i>Every supermarket sells it</i>
<i>in a package of three.</i>

31
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,982
While I was in Kyushu,

32
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,027
my ex off-loaded him on me.

33
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,115
She left a note
claiming that he is my kid,

34
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,866
but who knows.

35
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,161
So, you took custody of him?

36
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,372
No choice.

37
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,333
There's no one else to look after him.

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,425
Well...

39
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,093
If you two aren't related,

40
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,887
then someone must have
produced your clone.

41
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:41,888
You are right.

42
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,975
Master.

43
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,019
Can you feed him anything

44
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,063
if he comes here?

45
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,777
Don't hesitate to ask for anything.

46
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,542
If you play conservatively,

47
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,461
you cannot be the top.

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,172
Too bad. The dealer won't allow it.

49
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,425
Riichi, tanyao, pinfu. Dora, dora.

50
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,342
It's 12,000.

51
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,597
I should go before I cause more damage.

52
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,974
C'mon. It's still early.

53
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,687
This is from Mr. Kazuma.

54
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,069
Those kids.

55
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,613
Sorry.

56
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,450
We were too loud.

57
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,995
That's all right. Don't worry about it.

58
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,708
It's helping each other
that makes the world go around.

59
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,378
The world peace is great.

60
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,347
Anyone wants to compete with me
for the points?

61
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,433
Give us a break, Mr. Kazuma.

62
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,019
You're so aggressive
for both women and Mahjong.

63
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,270
No kidding.

64
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,151
Why don't you teach him a lesson?

65
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,196
With the skills,
you can destroy him easily.

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,113
Pung with that.

67
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:25,909
What did you say?

68
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,081
You got softer, huh?

69
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,753
If you make him do that,

70
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,296
Marilyn will be mad at you.

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,465
There will be no problem.

72
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,802
"While I am away,
help him remain faithful to me."

73
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,470
That's what she asked me.

74
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,349
-Right, Kimitoshi?
-That's right.

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,393
It's approved by Marilyn.

76
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,062
I can't believe Ogami.

77
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,023
He was in the first row with this boy,
watching our strip show.

78
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,277
He claims that this boy
misses his mom's boobs.

79
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,236
Hey.

80
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,406
How was Katherine's boobs?

81
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,287
I guess he didn't like them.

82
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,581
This could be an issue.

83
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,170
Welcome, Midori.

84
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,631
-Can I have beer?
-Sure.

85
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,647
-You want me to tell Marilyn?
-No, I was, well...

86
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,565
it's...

87
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,275
What are you eating?

88
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,570
Egg tofu rice bowl.

89
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:47,949
Is it good?

90
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,667
You sure?

91
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,424
You like her boobs, huh?

92
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,183
This is good.

93
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,187
What's your name?

94
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,481
Taizo.

95
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,987
Taizo, do you like pudding?

96
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,697
I like it.

97
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,210
Would you like to nap upstairs?

98
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,632
We can go together.

99
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,468
I'll wake you up
when someone comes for you.

100
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,599
I wonder which one of us will
get picked up first.

101
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,318
Did he fall asleep quickly?

102
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:06,903
Yes.

103
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,243
Kids are so cute.

104
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,704
Now I want my own, too.

105
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,707
Let me get you a drink as a thanks.

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,334
Score!

107
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,119
Thank you so much.

108
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,621
Sorry about the trouble.

109
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,206
It was nothing.

110
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,958
I got to nap, too.

111
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,714
Hello?

112
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,759
What have you been up to?

113
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,180
It must be in the blood.

114
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,265
What are you talking about?

115
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,684
I like boobs just like him.

116
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,735
That lady reminds me of the kid's mom.

117
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,863
What are you going to do?

118
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,033
Next year he will be school-age.

119
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,829
Hey...

120
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,498
Midori? Is that her name?

121
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,625
What does she do?

122
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,462
I think she is working in a hostess bar.

123
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,922
What a coincidence!

124
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,508
His mom also

125
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,510
works at a bar.

126
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,948
I've promised Taizo

127
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,076
I'd take him out to eat pudding today.

128
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,370
Then let me take you out.

129
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,540
We can go out to eat something
before pudding.

130
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,166
-Maybe see a movie?
-Old man.

131
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,335
You haven't admitted
that you're his father.

132
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,045
Don't invite yourself to our date.

133
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,381
Am I the unwelcomed third wheel?

134
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,924
That's exactly right.

135
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,804
Call me at this number.

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,889
I'll pick him up past noon.

137
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,943
I should have checked their store hours.

138
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,904
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,959
My parents are getting a divorce.

140
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,338
I knew this was coming,
so I'm not surprised at all.

141
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,673
It makes me laugh.

142
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,553
But it has made me so tough.

143
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,014
At the end of the day,

144
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,850
no one will protect me but myself.

145
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,356
You know what I mean?

146
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,029
Of course.

147
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,740
You've been through a lot, too.

148
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,785
We're kind of the same.

149
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,294
Hey.

150
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,713
Let's try to get pudding again next week.

151
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,799
Trust me. Theirs is the best.

152
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,147
Are those for me?

153
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:50,770
It's so warm.

154
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,403
<i>People finish their day</i>

155
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,863
<i>and hurry home.</i>

156
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>But sometimes</i>

157
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,493
<i>they don't want to go straight back home,</i>

158
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,413
<i>so they drop in somewhere</i>
<i>on the way home.</i>

159
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,793
Master, sorry for the trouble again.

160
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,503
Don't worry about me.

161
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,797
-But--
-I know.

162
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,093
I can't keep up this lifestyle with a kid.

163
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,804
There is a big game next week.

164
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,056
Until that's over,

165
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,434
I don't have time to think for this one.

166
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,625
Mr. Ogami, right?

167
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,378
Midori told me about you.

168
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,549
Then can you ask her...

169
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,386
to stop by at the diner,
when she has time?

170
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,056
The kid misses her.

171
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,975
She is downstairs.
You want me to get her?

172
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,893
Wait.

173
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,937
Just do what I asked you to do.

174
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,109
I'm...

175
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,695
looking forward to our game.

176
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,203
Thank you.

177
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,875
Taizo!

178
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,713
Hey.

179
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,719
Your hair looks super cute.
What did you do to it?

180
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,317
He is in the same trade as you.

181
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,070
He is an ex-male companion.

182
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,822
He is a good gambler,

183
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
but a troublesome gigolo.

184
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,787
I think...

185
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,956
she quit the hostess bar.

186
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,375
I guess she is forced to work...

187
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,794
somewhere she can earn more.

188
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,842
Welcome.

189
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,260
Mr. Ogami.

190
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,761
It's time.

191
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,729
I'll come get him before you close.

192
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,815
Please look after him.

193
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,875
Where is Midori working now?

194
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,461
She's doing well.
Working hard as usual.

195
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,339
She can't live without me.

196
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,092
Young man,

197
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,512
won't you leave her alone?

198
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,557
No?

199
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,935
Please don't disappoint me.

200
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,522
You and I...

201
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,317
are having a serious fight here.

202
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,657
Sure.

203
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,579
Do whatever you want.
She's all yours.

204
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,749
But only if...

205
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,709
you can beat me.

206
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,755
What a long day.

207
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,756
Good job.

208
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,813
Yes?

209
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,565
Yes.

210
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,070
Hotel Florida. Room number 906.

211
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,696
Understood.

212
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,785
Riichi.

213
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,458
Riichi.

214
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,849
Win on self-draw.
2,000-1,000 points.

215
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,936
What a junk hand!

216
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:58,869
Mahjong!

217
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,789
Win worth 8,000 points.

218
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,354
32,000 points.

219
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,283
Mahjong!

220
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,618
Mahjong!

221
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,630
I beg you.

222
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,595
Just one more game?

223
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,309
Nice job, sir.

224
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,604
Thank you.

225
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,774
Good job.

226
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,954
I feel like being dispossessed
of an evil spirit.

227
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,332
What's your plan now?

228
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,294
I'm going...

229
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,297
to visit my parents' grave with him.

230
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,008
While I still have money.

231
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,718
Is that right?

232
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,850
Hey.

233
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:46,811
Rest easy now.

234
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,023
That parasite won't be
back in town for a while.

235
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,572
Who do you think you are?
Some kind of superhero?

236
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,244
Where did you send Kazuma?

237
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,705
Give me back my Kazuma!

238
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,958
If only you had never came back.

239
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,960
What have you done?

240
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,878
Where is Kazuma?

241
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,547
Kazuma is...

242
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,924
You are an idiot!

243
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,662
This always happens.

244
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,916
You are used to it, huh?

245
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,465
Thank you for your kindness.

246
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:03,971
Let's go.

247
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,148
Excuse me.

248
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,067
Are you the famous

249
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,652
Mr. Ogami with a kid?

250
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,822
Some people call me that.

251
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,282
What can I do for you?

252
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,535
Can I ask you a few questions?

253
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,083
Just for a few minute.

254
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,960
Sorry about that.

255
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,754
<i>Mr. Ogami got panicked,</i>

256
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>thinking that he was accused</i>
<i>of illegal gambling.</i>

257
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,260
<i>It was actually about the violation</i>
<i>of the Child Welfare Act.</i>

258
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,598
<i>Taizo was sent to the foster care.</i>

259
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,976
<i>So what happened next?</i>

260
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,606
Mahjong! Three tiles, three colors.
Thirty points.

261
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,108
Impressive.

262
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,486
Taizo.

263
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,696
Your father is here to see you.

264
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,574
Hey, Taizo.

265
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,953
I bought pudding. Let's eat it together.

266
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,958
Daddy, I won.

267
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,668
-Did you?
-A lot.

268
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,419
-You won a lot, huh?
-I won a lot.

269
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,129
You won a lot. Great.

270
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,299
-I got 50 points so many times.
-Really?

271
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,259
That's great.

272
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,387
-Let's go out to eat sushi tonight.
-Yeah!

273
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,725
On soft egg tofu...

274
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,270
Drop dried young sardines
and fluffy perilla.

275
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,730
Here you go. Enjoy it.

276
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,193
It can be made easily.

277
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,904
Soft and fluffy...

278
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,948
Hey, stop it.

279
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,575
I'm sorry.

280
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:53,974
