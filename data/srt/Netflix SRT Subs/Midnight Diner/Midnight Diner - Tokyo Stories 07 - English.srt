1
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,822
<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,117
<i>and hurry home,</i>

3
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,286
<i>my day starts.</i>

4
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,146
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

5
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,148
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

6
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,152
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,697
PORK MISO SOUP COMBO,
BEER, SAKE, SHOCHU

8
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,240
<i>That's all I have on my menu.</i>

9
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,410
<i>But I'll make whatever customers request,</i>

10
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,038
<i>as long as I have the ingredients for it.</i>

11
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>That's my policy.</i>

12
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,004
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

13
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,423
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,013
Midnight Diner:
Tokyo Stories

15
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,933
HOT POT FOR ONE

16
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,772
Hot...

17
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,484
Okae,

18
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:31,902
you like it?

19
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,154
Yes, I love it.

20
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,281
This is too much hassle to
prepare at home.

21
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,701
Besides, I always have a ton of
leftovers afterwards.

22
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,707
<i>Kae was Chu's classmate.</i>

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,668
<i>Recently, she's been coming here</i>
<i>after work</i>

24
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>and ordering this hot pot for one.</i>

25
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,307
Thank you for the meal.

26
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,476
Well done.

27
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,229
-Would you like a drink?
-Sorry.

28
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,897
I must go back to work.

29
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,107
Now?

30
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,860
Clean rooms at the no-tell motel?
Nobody leaves until the morning.

31
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,197
There are more people checking in
and out than you think at this time.

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,574
A young part-timer took a day off
without advance notice.

33
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,243
I have to cover his shift.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,370
Too bad.

35
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,747
Take care of yourself. Okay?

36
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,084
Worry about yourself, Chu.
You drink too much.

37
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,336
Here.

38
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,754
Thank you.

39
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,090
Well...

40
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,261
See you around.

41
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,470
Take care.

42
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,186
Okae was the daughter
of a shoe store owner

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,896
that used to be at the corner.

44
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,815
She used to be quite pretty.

45
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,403
<i>Even though she was born</i>
<i>and raised in Shinjuku,</i>

46
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,363
<i>she was like a pure maiden,</i>

47
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,158
<i>carrying a white parasol all the time.</i>

48
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,494
<i>-She spoke like an upper-class lady.</i>
<i>-I don't like her.</i>

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,788
She sounds like a pretentious girl.

50
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,500
I knew some girls like that.
They don't know who they really are.

51
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,128
We can't befriend such a girl.

52
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,049
Chu, she was your first love, huh?

53
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,760
Stop it.

54
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,803
You have the wrong idea.

55
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,431
And then...

56
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,893
she was discovered
by a famous movie director,

57
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,353
but her acting career wasn't successful.

58
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,147
Later on,

59
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,067
she married some rich guy.
That's what I heard.

60
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,446
She doesn't look rich, does she?

61
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,407
I bet the story is made up.

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,701
That's why I don't like women.

63
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,746
To be honest,
I don't know if it's true or not.

64
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,249
Besides, we hadn't seen each other
for almost four decades.

65
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,420
She seems to make a hard living.

66
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,005
Then you don't really know

67
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,216
anything about her life
from the past four decades?

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,719
She came back to this area recently.

69
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,139
At first, I didn't even recognize her.

70
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,310
This is a great croquette.
You should eat it while it's still hot.

71
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,270
Eat it as soon as you get home. Okay?

72
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,482
Or would you like to eat it now?

73
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,275
Yes?

74
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,736
Here you--

75
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,996
Chu?

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,751
It is you.

77
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,795
Chu, right?

78
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,463
What?

79
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,425
It's Kae, from the shoe store.

80
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,347
Okae?

81
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,683
Long time, no see.

82
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,184
How have you been?

83
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,396
Had some ups and downs...

84
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,441
but I'm okay, as you can see.

85
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,069
See you soon.

86
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,197
Teppei.

87
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,657
Wait.

88
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,373
I'm what?

89
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,542
Lavishing money on a young lover?

90
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,923
Chu's losing his mind, isn't he?

91
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,216
I hope he's okay.

92
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,720
But he is not completely...

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,681
wrong about it.

94
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,688
<i>That young man is the only son</i>
<i>of Kae's brother.</i>

95
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,566
<i>Apparently, she saw him</i>
<i>at her brother's funeral last year</i>

96
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,444
<i>for the first time in more than ten years.</i>

97
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,258
So...

98
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,303
do you have the money
to cover the service?

99
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,471
Of course, not.

100
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,640
No?

101
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,267
The body's been cremated.

102
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,977
That's why I called you, Auntie.

103
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,064
For money? I don't have any either.

104
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,943
Then we'll have to run.

105
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,654
How can you run away?

106
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,115
-What about the ashes?
-I don't care.

107
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,410
Come on. He's your father.

108
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,871
That asshole? He is no one to me.

109
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,833
I was relieved when he disappeared
without a trace. Then he died.

110
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,544
It's not even worth picking up his bones.

111
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,088
Listen here.

112
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,341
No matter how terrible he was,
he's still your father.

113
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,259
Blood is thicker than water.

114
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,137
You can't ignore it.

115
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,932
And you know it.
That's why you called me.

116
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,440
You are hopeless.

117
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,486
I'll ask them to see
if you can pay in installments.

118
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,948
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

119
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,908
<i>Kae's nephew is a bum,</i>

120
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,703
<i>just like his father.</i>

121
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,830
<i>His wife left him.</i>

122
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,875
<i>He has no job, and he's in his 40s.</i>

123
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,422
I'm home.

124
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:26,965
Teppei,

125
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,009
have you eaten dinner?

126
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,355
What a mess!

127
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,778
Shut up.

128
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,162
You are so sloppy.

129
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,467
Hey, Nguyen, come here.

130
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,761
Get the other side.

131
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,722
Ready?

132
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,807
Grip the ends.

133
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,143
Okay.

134
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,786
Here you go.

135
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,504
You like it? Delicious, isn't it?

136
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,510
I've wanted to feed you
this hot pot for one for a while.

137
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,472
But it's not "hot pot for one"

138
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,766
if the two of us eat it together.

139
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,268
Okae.

140
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,354
-Want some?
-Sorry.

141
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,189
I have to go back to work.

142
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,399
The part-timer quit.

143
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,445
These days, young folks don't know
what hard work means.

144
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,157
Why don't you ask
your nephew to help you?

145
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,952
-You agree?
-Stop your nonsense.

146
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,788
Where are you going?

147
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,790
I finished it, so don't complain.

148
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,750
Can I borrow some money?

149
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,419
Going out for a drink again?

150
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,464
I lent you money the other day.

151
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:32,966
Fine.

152
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,300
Wait.

153
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,719
You give me no choice.

154
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,935
You don't have a job?

155
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,021
No job and you just get drunk?

156
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,149
Don't you even want to help her?

157
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,276
Hey, cut it out.

158
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,945
Don't worry about me.

159
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,118
What have you done?

160
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,955
He's struggling to figure out
how to go on with his life.

161
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,665
Why can't he have a drink?

162
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,168
Just mind your own business.

163
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,794
Master, check please.

164
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,505
Twelve hundred yen.

165
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,093
Thank you.

166
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,394
Should I have said nothing?

167
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,773
You are her childhood friend.

168
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,860
That wasn't so out of line for you.

169
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,404
First loves...

170
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,239
never work out.

171
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,200
Right?

172
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,457
Wait for me, Teppei. Look.

173
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,710
I circled the good ones.

174
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,587
Look.

175
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,341
Auntie,

176
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,345
do you think that a man who filed
for bankruptcy can find a good job?

177
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,057
There are a lot of jobs
if you keep your expectations realistic.

178
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,935
What he said may be a good idea.
The no-tell motel.

179
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,437
Do you want me to ask
the manager about the job?

180
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,438
Come on.

181
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,398
I'm still young.

182
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,568
Unlike you,
I can't give up on my future yet.

183
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,992
Then... what do you want to do?

184
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,080
I was like you once.

185
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,581
When I was young,

186
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,460
I chased after something fancy.

187
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,797
A luxurious life that everyone would envy.

188
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,132
But...

189
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,469
I found nothing in my hand

190
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,430
when I thought that I finally got it.

191
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,023
I know you have to learn
from your own failures.

192
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,819
Get a drink, okay?

193
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,198
Come home safely.

194
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,680
Teppei?

195
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,849
Wake up.

196
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,226
Regarding the job,

197
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
my manager wants to interview--

198
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,668
Hey, Chu.

199
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,296
Did you lose at the horse races again?

200
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,589
No.

201
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,800
Remember Kae's nephew?

202
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,137
He stole her entire fortune,
including credit cards,

203
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,098
her ATM card, cash, and ran away.

204
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,769
Okae shouldn't have spoiled him.

205
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,979
But still...

206
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,364
Good evening.

207
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,656
Welcome.

208
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,160
Give me warm sake and the hot pot.

209
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,453
Kae,

210
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,080
did something good happen?

211
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,126
Look at this.

212
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,961
It's pretty, isn't it?

213
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,633
Teppei sent it to me

214
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,927
as a birthday gift.

215
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,179
It looks great on you.

216
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,514
Doesn't it?

217
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,933
I was right.
Blood is thicker than water.

218
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,686
Did you get your money back?

219
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,607
I don't care about that anymore.

220
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,453
Okae,

221
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,789
you disappoint me.

222
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,624
Why?

223
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,793
You're deceived by such a gift.

224
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,088
I'm sure he bought it with your money.

225
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,882
I'm telling you,

226
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,552
it's not about the money.

227
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,262
What's wrong with you?

228
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,139
Wake up.

229
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,307
When you were young,

230
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,810
you were beautiful and independent.

231
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,146
You were an awesome lady.

232
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,942
Are you saying
that I'm embarrassing now?

233
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,318
Yes, you're embarrassing.

234
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,238
He's the only family you have?
So, what?

235
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,656
You're being irrational.

236
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,409
You have no idea.

237
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,037
Once I started living with Teppei,
I learned it was a joy

238
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,000
to work for someone else
for the first time in my life.

239
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,960
I should be thanking him.

240
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,754
Okae, are you being serious?

241
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,175
I'm serious. Completely serious.

242
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,053
How can you criticize me?

243
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,139
You have no family.

244
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,225
You get drunk by yourself every night.

245
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,270
You're more embarrassing than I am.

246
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,113
Here you go.

247
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,157
Enjoy.

248
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,799
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,718
I was too harsh.

250
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,976
Have some.

251
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,978
No thanks.

252
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,483
Just eat it.

253
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,417
So, you like it?

254
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,929
Later, I can make rice porridge
with the soup for you.

255
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,306
Good idea!

256
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:51,946
Hello?

257
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,534
Yes.

258
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,335
I understand.

259
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,716
Teppei was arrested.

260
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,815
<i>Kae's nephew was charged</i>

261
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,693
<i>with several offenses,</i>
<i>including theft,</i>

262
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,778
<i>swindling on small loans,</i>

263
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,323
<i>and more.</i>

264
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,450
<i>He got a prison sentence.</i>

265
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,579
<i>Now Kae visits him in prison often.</i>
<i>That's what I heard.</i>

266
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,212
<i>About six months have passed</i>
<i>since then.</i>

267
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,554
-Good evening.
-Welcome.

268
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,723
Have a seat there.

269
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,435
Master, make him anything he wants.

270
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,562
Kae, who is this?

271
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,982
This is Teppei's son.
His name is Shohei.

272
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,112
I didn't know
that Teppei had such a big boy.

273
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,533
Since his mother got remarried,
he has no place to stay.

274
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,203
So, I took custody of him.

275
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,829
Man,

276
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,123
what a nuisance, huh?

277
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,751
What would you like?

278
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,461
Meat!

279
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,715
-And you, Kae? Hot pot for one?
-Nothing for me.

280
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,301
We ate hot pot at home
last night together.

281
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,680
Wait. Warm sake.

282
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,431
Sure.

283
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,278
Here you go.
A special plate full of meat.

284
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,991
-Let's eat.
-Go ahead.

285
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,039
Hey.

286
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,209
Make sure you chew it well.

287
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,050
-Master, give him some juice.
-Sure.

288
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,016
I never imagined...

289
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,310
I'd have the chance...

290
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,814
to raise a kid at this age.

291
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,287
Okae...

292
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,998
never looked at her feet,
under her nose,

293
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,917
even though she was the daughter
of a shoe store.

294
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,005
I just guess...

295
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,050
that she wanted to see other scenaries.

296
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,054
You're right.

297
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,808
That's what she wanted.

298
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,980
Tonight, she looked even better

299
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,774
than when she was young.

300
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,195
Chu,

301
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,947
this one's on me.

302
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,536
Are you sure?

303
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,905
<i>It's not easy to live one's life,</i>

304
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,075
<i>whether you're alone</i>
<i>or have someone else.</i>

305
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,372
<i>That's good.</i>

306
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,290
<i>In an earthen pot for one,</i>

307
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,751
<i>simmer Chinese cabbage,</i>

308
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,337
<i>pork and enoki mushrooms</i>
<i>in a bonito broth.</i>

309
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,297
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

310
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,759
Simple is the best.

311
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,222
It looks delicious.

312
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,808
Here you go.

313
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,352
Hold it, Kae.

314
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,854
Don't forget the <i>bushukan.</i>

315
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,608
That's very important.

316
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,946
Bushukan<i> is a citrus fruit from Tosa.</i>

317
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,825
<i>The juice is a perfect match</i>
<i>for my hot pot.</i>

318
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,619
Make sure to eat a lot.

319
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,420
-It's so delicious.
-Isn't it?

320
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,932
THIS STORY IS FICTION
