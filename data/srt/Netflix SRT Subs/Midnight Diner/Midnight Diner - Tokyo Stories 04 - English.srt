1
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,692
<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,361
<i>and hurry home,</i>

3
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>my day starts.</i>

4
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,009
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

5
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,136
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

6
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,056
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,021
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

8
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,481
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

9
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,488
MIDNIGHT DINER:
TOKYO STORIES

10
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,783
OMELET RICE

11
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>Everyone has forgotten</i>
<i>their umbrella somewhere.</i>

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>But his case is extreme.</i>

13
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,926
<i>He is always soaking wet</i>
<i>whenever he comes to my joint.</i>

14
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,055
Again? Just stay right there.

15
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,772
<i>His name is Mr. Amamiya.</i>

16
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,775
<i>I hear that he is</i>
<i>a promising young physicist.</i>

17
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,197
-Thanks. Omelet rice, please.
-Sure thing.

18
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,247
Here you go.

19
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,461
Let's eat.

20
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,190
Ah, I see!

21
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,104
Master, check please.

22
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,773
-Sure thing.
-Oh, no...

23
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,608
May I have my check, too?

24
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,195
You have to go now?

25
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,948
A conference is coming up soon.
I'm very busy.

26
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,324
Thanks for the meal.

27
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,006
Oh, no...

28
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,930
Thank you.

29
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,189
Another one...

30
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,525
Thank you so much.

31
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,535
I'm going that way.

32
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,662
Then take this umbrella.

33
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,207
My place is right there.

34
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,042
I'll be okay.

35
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,002
Hold on...

36
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,172
I may not be able to return it to you.

37
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,758
Can you?

38
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,225
-This is where I work.
-Okay.

39
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm not asking you to be my customer.

40
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,440
Is that right?

41
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,319
This...

42
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,281
A champagne bottle.

43
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,579
Wait, what? What's going on?

44
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,999
You're soaking wet.
What happened?

45
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,670
This is not right.
It has to be this way.

46
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,589
It should be like this.

47
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,551
-Right there?
-Yes, I want to write it there.

48
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,054
-Absolutely necessary?
-Yes.

49
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,018
Thanks. I'll use this.

50
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,024
That's right. That's right.

51
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,366
It's Higgs potential.

52
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,413
HIGGS POTENTIAL IS A PHYSICS THEORY
PROPOSED BY PETER HIGGS.

53
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,248
Is that a permanent marker?

54
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,627
IT'S A DIAGRAM THAT LOOKS LIKE
A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE.

55
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,922
I see. Now I got it.

56
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,510
Your friend is a little strange.

57
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,345
I apologize.

58
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,891
Oh, no...

59
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,854
I can't take this home.

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,527
-Excuse me...
-Yes?

61
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,249
What a groundbreaking device!

62
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,418
This is wonderful.

63
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,548
How can I thank you? But...

64
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,342
How can I get this picture?

65
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,347
First you should finish it
before you forget it.

66
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,223
Right.

67
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,926
I didn't think
that you would actually come.

68
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,013
I just wanted to thank you in person.

69
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,975
It wasn't a big deal.

70
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,395
But...

71
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,814
I'm glad to see you again.

72
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,535
Are you okay?

73
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,455
You look sad.

74
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,666
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,045
To tell you the truth,

76
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,840
yesterday...

77
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,595
CHAPPIE

78
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,328
Mr. Amamiya,

79
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,498
thank you for coming today.

80
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,919
It's nothing, Rei.

81
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,259
My real name is Yoona.

82
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,510
Rei is just...

83
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,929
my name at the nightclub.

84
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,557
Yoona, huh?

85
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,313
Komichi, you've got
an old-fashioned toy, huh?

86
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,858
I hear that it's good for my brain,
so I bought it.

87
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,904
But it's too difficult,
so I'm just exercising my hands.

88
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,201
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

89
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,244
Welcome.

90
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,791
Are you on an after-shift date?

91
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,543
Mr. Amamiya,
you are a guy after all.

92
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,837
An after-shift? What is that?

93
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:55,053
Wait, so... are you two actually dating?

94
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,990
Sorry.

95
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,951
We don't open until midnight.

96
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,538
Master, sorry to bother you
before opening.

97
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,624
I wanted to ask you a favor.

98
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,880
Is it...

99
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,090
done?

100
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,009
You did well.

101
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,850
-So her real name is Yoona?
-Yes.

102
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,853
She cooked it just for you, huh?

103
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:31,149
-That's so sweet.
-It was so delicious.

104
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,403
That's not good for my business.

105
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,283
-You should all learn from her.
-Mind your own business.

106
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,411
If we had someone special,
of course we would cook for him.

107
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,829
Right?

108
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,373
Master,

109
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,251
I've decided to move in with Yoona.

110
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,298
-Is that right? I wish you all the best.
-Thank you.

111
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,970
I'm going to see her family in Korea.

112
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,600
But when I told my mother that
Yoona and I were moving in together,

113
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,894
she told me to think about it more.

114
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,482
Is that her way of disapproving
the two of you?

115
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,652
Is she against an international marriage?

116
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,323
That shouldn't be a problem,
as long as they love each other.

117
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,661
But considering the cultural
and language differences,

118
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,955
I get why the parents
would be concerned.

119
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,164
My mother even said...

120
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,794
that I might be out of my mind.

121
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,671
But...

122
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,299
I should be out of my mind
if I'm in love, right?

123
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,558
It's not done perfectly.

124
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,728
Are you upset?

125
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,778
Thank you.

126
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,322
<i>Mr. Amamiya has tried everything</i>

127
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,158
<i>to convince his parents,</i>

128
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,078
<i>but they haven't approved</i>
<i>of the marriage yet.</i>

129
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,337
-Welcome.
-Good evening.

130
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,465
Today...

131
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,468
is my last day at work.

132
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,306
This is pickled eggplant.

133
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,059
I hope you like it.

134
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,110
-Delicious.
-Really?

135
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,545
I came to Japan...

136
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,467
in order to work and pay back

137
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,510
my father's business debt.

138
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,141
My parents...

139
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,101
ran...

140
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,646
a small diner.

141
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,943
But their business went south
when new restaurants opened.

142
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,991
Someone might see me
if I worked in Seoul.

143
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,744
I lied to my parents and said

144
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,829
I would become a translator here.

145
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,583
I really just wanted
to pay off their debt.

146
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,753
You've worked very hard.

147
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,173
And you paid it off?

148
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,429
My parents want to restart their diner.

149
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,598
They are very excited.

150
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,475
Good for them.

151
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,730
Have you told...

152
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,775
Mr. Amamiya about the debt?

153
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,947
I was going to tell him
once I paid it off.

154
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:07,949
I see.

155
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,202
Today...

156
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,497
-your meal is on me.
-Really?

157
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,838
Then can I have another?

158
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,339
Of course.

159
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,026
Welcome.

160
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,239
What's wrong?

161
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,454
She left...

162
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,205
this letter.

163
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,089
TO MR. AMAMIYA

164
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,093
What does it say?

165
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,436
"I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you
about the debt.

166
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,231
When I told my parents
that I wanted to marry you,

167
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,192
they opposed it.

168
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,235
I will go back to Seoul.

169
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,071
And I will help my parents' diner.

170
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,574
I can't abandon my family

171
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,701
to marry you.

172
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm really sorry."

173
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,127
Yoona...

174
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,009
<i>After that, Mr. Amamiya devoted</i>

175
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,553
<i>his time to his research</i>

176
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,932
<i>and turned down meeting</i>
<i>with any potential marriage partner.</i>

177
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,863
Is that...?

178
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,156
Look.

179
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,868
AMAMIYA, THE THIRD JAPANESE
TO EARN THE PHYSICS AWARD

180
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,544
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

181
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,298
Let's eat.

182
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,263
I remember a diner in Seoul

183
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,015
that serves great omelet rice.

184
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,185
Really? They have omelet rice in Korea?

185
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,689
It's the female chef's signature dish.

186
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,108
She learned it in Tokyo.

187
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,141
Here you go.

188
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,894
-This is the one?
-Try it. It's so delicious.

189
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:24,979
Another one.

190
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,316
Welcome.

191
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,217
Finally, I found you.

192
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,599
I need you.

193
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,356
Wow, very romantic.

194
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,860
Old man, you are too old for that.

195
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,654
You do it in broad daylight?

196
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,203
Watch your mouth.

197
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,665
It's none of your business.

198
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,125
What is he saying?

199
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,796
We are... totally in love.

200
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,676
We should go.

201
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,306
Mr. Amamiya.

202
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,352
I'm sorry, but right now...

203
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,437
I can't accept your love.

204
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,817
-Yoona...
-But please keep in mind

205
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,237
that I don't wish we had been born

206
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,864
in the same country.

207
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,743
Because I was born in a different country,

208
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,706
I was able to meet you.

209
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,004
Thank you for coming.

210
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,459
Here you go. Enjoy it.

211
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,631
May I grill the meat for you?

212
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,394
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

213
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,981
The jjigae is so delicious, Mother.

214
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,025
Mother?

215
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,906
It's premature for you to say that.

216
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,166
<i>I hear that Mr. Amamiya is determined</i>
<i>to keep going to the diner</i>

217
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,252
<i>until Yoona's parents approve</i>
<i>of their marriage,</i>

218
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,214
<i>while doing his research in Seoul.</i>

219
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,179
A life is like floating

220
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,809
and being carried away
by the Imjin River.

221
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,562
Love has no border.

222
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,689
Keep swimming to the end.

223
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,253
<i>To make a fluffy omelet,</i>

224
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,506
make sure you use a lot of butter.

225
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,883
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

226
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:25,844
Enjoy it.

227
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,685
Haste makes...

228
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,020
Waste.

229
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,401
Good night.

230
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:53,891
