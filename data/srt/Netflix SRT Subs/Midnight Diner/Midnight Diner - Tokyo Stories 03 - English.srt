00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,436
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

8
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,688

MIDNIGHT DINER:
TOKYO STORIES

00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,948
TONTEKI

00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,246
<i>Once it starts to get cold,</i>

12
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>Shigemi knits a new sweater every year.</i>

13
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,464
You're so good.

14
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,716
I'm just used to it.

15
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,843
A gift for your boyfriend?

16
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,387
Boyfriend? Kind of.

17
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,806
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>
<i>she knits one</i>

18
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,184
<i>for a different "boyfriend" each time.</i>

19
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,811
Here is your tonteki.

20
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,773
These days it's rare to see

21
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,983
someone knitting in a public place.

22
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,194
You're right about that.

23
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,783
Welcome.

24
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,827
Mr. Ichihara!

25
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,288
Hi, Ms. Suzuki. How are you?

26
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,665
Well. Thank you.

27
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,464
Is he your friend?

28
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,759
This is Mr. Ichihara,
an interior designer.

29
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,512
He recently opened his office
in this area.

30
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,722
Ms. Suzuki recommended this joint to me.

31
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,351
Two pork soup combos, please.

32
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,436
-A smaller size for me.
-Sure thing.

33
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,025
This is Ms. Suzuki, a realtor
who helped me find the office.

34
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,821
Thank you for finding
such a great property.

35
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,989
I was just doing my job.

36
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,161
Why don't we ask her
to find our condo, too?

37
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,454
That's a good idea.

38
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,166
We are planning to live near my office.
Can you find one for us?

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,585
Yes, of course.

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,019
Why?

41
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,647
Here.

42
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,611
Don't tell me...

43
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,072
this was for that guy.

44
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,869
Obviously, I'm just a realtor
for Mr. Ichihara.

45
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,664
Were you knitting it for a man
who isn't even your boyfriend?

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,627
You didn't even know
that he had a girlfriend?

47
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,131
It was very premature.

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,383
It's fine. I'm used to it!

49
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,732
Think she'll be okay?

50
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,859
She was so shocked.

51
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,695
Don't worry.

52
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,447
Are you sure?

53
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,908
Shigemi looks fragile,

54
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,284
but she's resilient.

55
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,538
<i>I was right.</i>

56
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>About ten days later...</i>

57
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,418
It's open.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,296
Hello!

59
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,298
Here you go.

60
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,258
Thank you.

61
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,263
He'll make you whatever you want,
so ask for anything.

62
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,226
As long as I have the ingredients for it.

63
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,312
Kurihara, Yoshida and Shirano.

64
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,356
They're younger colleagues of mine.

65
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,650
Did you know, Master?

66
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,278
Kurihara is from Yokkaichi,
and tonteki is his favorite food.

67
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,323
I hear that Yokkaichi
is famous for tonteki.

68
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,408
Yes, the meat has several slits,

69
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,035
and the thick sauce is unique.

70
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,790
My sauce is light,
so I don't know if you'll like it or not.

71
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,916
I'd like to try it.

72
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,627
How about you, Yoshida?

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,756
Sorry, I don't eat anything after nine,
so I don't gain weight.

74
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,757
I see.

75
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,217
And you, Shirano?

76
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,554
I will have tonteki, too.

77
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,557
-Then three tontekis, please.
-Got it.

78
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,226
Cheers.

79
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,644
Cheers.

80
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,826
Ms. Suzuki, you like to knit?

81
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,371
Ever since I was little.

82
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,499
I like women who can knit.
They look quite feminine.

83
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,421
I'd like to learn it, then.

84
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,756
Ms. Suzuki, can you teach me?

85
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,022
Here you go.

86
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,865
Like it?

87
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,745
I see.

88
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,790
Yokkaichi's tonteki goes well with rice.

89
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,917
Yours is perfect for drinks.

90
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,797
Actually, can I have rice?

91
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,257
Sure.

92
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,844
Rice with this?
You'll gain weight for sure.

93
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,681
<i>I guess Shigemi's current love interest...</i>

94
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>is this guy.</i>

95
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,103
I'm leaving.

96
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,647
See you tomorrow.

97
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,031
I'm going home.

98
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,419
See you tomorrow.

99
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,007
-Kurihara.
-Yes?

100
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,718
For you.

101
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,846
Really?

102
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,102
I hope it's your size.

103
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,284
Perfect.

104
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,329
Can I really have it?

105
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,961
I've wanted a sweater like this.

106
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,171
Thank you so much.

107
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,263
And? What was his reaction?

108
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,391
I think he likes it.

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,729
But I don't feel
like it makes us any closer.

110
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,232
Did you tell him how you felt
when you gave it to him?

111
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,365
But he accepted the gift.

112
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,577
That means he probably accepted
my feelings, too. Right?

113
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,203
Am I right?

114
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,623
Men wouldn't be excited

115
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,625
about a handmade sweater
from someone

116
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,294
whom they're not interested in.

117
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,047
But he accepted it.

118
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,340
Which means
he accepted her love, right?

119
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,051
Come on.

120
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,803
Knitting a sweater to grab his attention?

121
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,597
You're beating around the bush.

122
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,266
Why don't you just say, "I love you"?

123
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,018
You're not a teen anymore.

124
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,688
Not everyone's mentally tough
like you are, Rumi.

125
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,398
It's like fracturing a bone.

126
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,485
Once it heals, that part gets tougher.

127
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,403
What do you mean?

128
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:34,908
Welcome.

129
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,798
What does Kurihara think about me?

130
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,218
Can you ask him casually?

131
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,969
You want me to ask?

132
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,848
You're the only one I can rely on.

133
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,607
Sure.

134
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,859
I'll ask him.

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,402
I appreciate it.

136
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,411
Excuse me, Ms. Suzuki.

137
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,288
Yes?

138
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,874
Well...

139
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,795
in return for that,

140
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,382
will you teach me how to knit?

141
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,217
What?

142
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,637
I'd like to knit a scarf.

143
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,973
Okay, but...

144
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,016
Is it a gift for someone?

145
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,813
Is it difficult to knit a scarf?

146
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,982
Not at all. Don't worry.

147
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,109
The important thing is your heart.

148
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,112
She will be so happy
if you give it to her.

149
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,447
Here you go.

150
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,075
-Enjoy the meal.
-Yes.

151
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,912
I see. A scarf, huh?

152
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,956
How old is she?

153
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,085
She is about your age.

154
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,972
I'm so clumsy.

155
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,976
I think you're good with your hands.

156
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,856
When I was in elementary school,

157
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,027
I wrote in an essay
that my favorite food is tonteki.

158
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,575
So, a boy I liked started calling me
"Pig Girl who likes tonteki."

159
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,493
I was overweight back then.

160
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,000
I have low self esteem.

161
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,545
Whenever I like someone,
I knit a sweater, or a scarf.

162
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,257
In most cases,
I don't even give it to him.

163
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,682
By the way, did you ask him?

164
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:05,934
What?

165
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,103
Right.

166
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,483
I think...

167
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,278
Kurihara doesn't like...

168
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,783
the color of the sweater
you gave him.

169
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,369
But...

170
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,913
he wears it at home.

171
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,582
He's a nice guy.

172
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,128
So, he couldn't tell you
that it wasn't his favorite color.

173
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,005
Is that right?

174
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,258
He should have told me that.
I wouldn't be hurt.

175
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,012
What is his favorite color, then?

176
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,809
I see. The issue was the color, huh?

177
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,894
How about this one?

178
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,691
Or...

179
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,402
maybe a brighter color?

180
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:01,990
Welcome.

181
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,788
This is your first time coming alone.

182
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,707
Right.

183
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,004
Have you finished the scarf?

184
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,555
I lied about that.

185
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,224
What?

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,143
I'm leaving.

187
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,352
See you tomorrow.

188
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,861
Hey, Shirano. Do you have a moment?

189
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,242
I've been going out with Yoshida.

190
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,577
Oh really?

191
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,871
And...

192
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,125
Ms. Suzuki gave this to me.

193
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,257
Yoshida ripped it
to see how strong it was.

194
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,886
Women are nasty.

195
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,558
So...

196
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,353
Can you throw it away for me?

197
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,152
Really?

198
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,820
Thank you so much.

199
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,865
A handmade sweater carries

200
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,241
so much emotion.

201
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,285
I can't do it myself.

202
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,464
What are you doing?

203
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,800
It's just trash.

204
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,472
<i>I'm disappointed in myself.</i>

205
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,103
Ms. Suzuki confided in me.

206
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,482
I knew I should tell her the truth,

207
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,111
but I couldn't.

208
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,073
She's...

209
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,744
knitting another sweater for Kurihara.

210
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,872
I feel so bad.

211
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,418
Then...

212
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,671
the reason for making a scarf was...

213
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,260
I wanted to repair the sweater myself.

214
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,054
That's why I learned how to knit.

215
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,226
I know she didn't knit it for me, but...

216
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,814
it's made with Ms. Suzuki's love.

217
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,235
What now?

218
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,195
Will you...

219
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,614
stick to the lie?

220
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:02,962
Welcome.

221
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,090
Ms. Suzuki?

222
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,719
Kurihara.
Why are you here?

223
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,055
Shirano asked me to come here
and talk to him.

224
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,390
He asked me to come, too.

225
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,144
Would you like to sit?

226
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,534
Why are you wearing that?

227
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,245
Kurihara gave it to me.

228
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,250
Kurihara is dating Yoshida.

229
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,502
Why are you...?

230
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,178
Is that so?

231
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,597
Come on, Kurihara.

232
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,392
You should have told me that.

233
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,031
Ms. Suzuki.

234
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,284
What can I say?

235
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:17,995
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,170
Ms. Shigemi!

237
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,508
This sweater...

238
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,052
is warm...

239
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,054
and very comfy.

240
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,765
I really like it.

241
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,144
So what?

242
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,148
So...

243
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,570
I don't care about the sweater anymore!

244
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,117
<i>Shigemi or Shirano</i>

245
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,745
<i>didn't come back for a while after that.</i>

246
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,557
Come in. This way.

247
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,104
It's bigger than I expected.

248
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,065
We can have a dining table here.

249
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,360
The TV would be there?

250
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,199
-It's perfect for two of us, but...
-What?

251
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,453
I'm thinking about a kid.

252
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,266
Have you been drinking alone?

253
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,191
I quit knitting.

254
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,320
I realized that...

255
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,530
it's strange to give

256
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,034
a handmade sweater to someone
I'm not even dating.

257
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,703
It was silly of me to get excited.

258
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,164
I'm such an idiot.

259
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,626
I don't know.

260
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,089
The other day...

261
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,299
Shirano...

262
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,677
came here by himself.

263
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,180
He sat there...

264
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,266
and was repairing the sweater.

265
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,019
Right up here...

266
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,105
there was a hole.

267
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,984
He was not good at knitting.

268
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,153
And I felt bad for him.

269
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,741
He said,
"it's made with Ms. Suzuki's love."

270
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,661
He worked so hard to fix it.

271
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,517
That can't be true.

272
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,898
What is this feeling?

273
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,234
What...

274
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,319
is this feeling?

275
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,405
What is this feeling?

276
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,366
What is this feeling?

277
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,367
Shigemi?

278
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,827
Are you okay?

279
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,710
What the hell is this feeling?

280
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,226
Are you okay?

281
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,021
Ms. Suzuki?

282
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,529
Shirano...

283
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:21,864
I thought...

284
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,867
that I only liked handsome guys.

285
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,246
Well, how do I say it?
What I mean is...

286
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,832
Well... you...

287
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,584
fixed my sweater.

288
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,045
Master told me about it.

289
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,379
So...

290
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,340
I was moved by your affection.

291
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,592
No, that's not right.

292
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,428
-What I'm trying to say is...
-I love you.

293
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,477
I love you,

294
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,354
Ms. Shigemi.

295
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,445
I love you, too.

296
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,628
<i>If you cover pork with flour,</i>

297
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,881
<i>it sucks up the sauce well.</i>

298
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,510
<i>After adding the sauce to the pan,</i>
<i>drop in the grated onion.</i>

299
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,720
<i>It adds great depth</i>

300
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,764
<i>to the light sauce.</i>

301
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,976
Ms. Shigemi.

302
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,978
What are you making?

303
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,773
Underwear.

304
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,234
It looks so warm.

305
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,614
-Good night.
-Good night.

306
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,932
THIS STORY IS FICTION
