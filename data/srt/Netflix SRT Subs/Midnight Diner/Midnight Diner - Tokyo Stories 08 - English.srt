<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,110
<i>and hurry home,</i>

3
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,279
<i>my day starts.</i>

4
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,757
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

5
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,718
<i>to seven in the morning.</i>

6
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,805
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

7
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,853
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>

8
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,147
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

9
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,029
Midnight Diner:
Tokyo Stories

10
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,866
SAUTÉED YAM

11
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,703
I think it's Ami.

12
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,872
I don't know...

13
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,332
It looks exactly like her.

14
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,126
-Look at her lips.
-But...

15
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,961
I don't believe Ami would do that.

16
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,255
Hey, Master.

17
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,091
What do you think?

18
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,761
He thinks it's Ami.

19
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,056
Remember Ami?
She used to be our band's vocalist.

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,058
We brought her here a few times.

21
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,393
I see some resemblance.

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,395
But I'm not certain.

23
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,193
-Why don't you download it?
-Good idea.

24
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,569
We should examine it.

25
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,780
Are we all agreed?

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
Let's go to my place.

27
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,745
Thanks for the meal.

28
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,166
Let's get a taxi.

29
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,211
What was that?

30
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,965
A girl named Ami was an idol
when they were in college.

31
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,426
I see. Now she's in an adult movie?

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,886
Of course, they'd be excited.

33
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,264
Speaking of adult movies,
Oki is in the paper.

34
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,978
Wow. I'm impressed.

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,024
Come in.

36
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,860
Welcome.

37
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,198
This is Mr. Hisamatsu,
the president of Hisamatsu Printing.

38
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,660
And his wife, Fujiko.
He is my best client.

39
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,578
I'm Hisamatsu.

40
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,873
Rumi told me
that there was a unique diner.

41
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,625
So, I asked her to take me there.

42
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,380
Hot sake? Is that okay?

43
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,048
Fujiko?

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,968
-Sure.
-Then I'll have one, too.

45
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,721
-Hot sake. Got it.
-You make...

46
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,140
whatever the customers request,
is that right?

47
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,102
-As long as I have the ingredients.
-What do you want, Fujiko?

48
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,479
Well, let's see...

49
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,234
Sir,

50
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,903
I heard that you love sautéed yam.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,573
That's true, but...

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
That's okay. Let's have it.

53
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,204
Master, sautéed yam, please.

54
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,205
Sure.

55
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,106
Here you are.

56
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,121
So, what do you think?

57
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,252
I'm sorry to say,

58
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,713
but my wife's yam is better.

59
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,090
I see.

60
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,092
Mine is no match, huh?

61
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,428
No match.

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,430
He's lying.

63
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,974
This is much better than mine.

64
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,728
I just use butter to sauté the yam,
and that's it.

65
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,730
And that's what makes it good.

66
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,900
He spoils me.

67
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,779
Ma'am, he treats you very well, huh?

68
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,113
I envy you.

69
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,491
I must treat her well.
Otherwise, heaven will punish me.

70
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,372
I fell in love with her
when she was still a student.

71
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,208
I begged her to marry me.

72
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,378
She didn't even know
how to cook then.

73
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,923
I didn't give her any time
to learn homemaking skills.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,093
See? He's still spoiling me.

75
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,345
That's great.

76
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,056
I think that it'd be normal
if you two were newlywed.

77
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,391
How long have you--?

78
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,060
Twenty-three years and four months.

79
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,899
Welcome.

80
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,527
Mr. Oki, I saw your article.

81
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,113
Thanks. Hi, Master,

82
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,574
-beer and potato salad, please.
-Sure.

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,912
<i>As many may know,</i>

84
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>Mr. Erect Oki is</i>
<i>a famous adult movie star</i>

85
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,293
<i>with many legends to tell.</i>

86
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,671
Mr. Oki, Ms. Miku Yukino chose you

87
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,673
as a co-star in her final movie, huh?

88
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,508
I envy you, Mr. Oki.

89
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,969
You're still popular
among young actresses like her.

90
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,263
-It's a job.
-I know.

91
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,266
But still, you get to do stuff
with pretty young women.

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,685
How many women
have you worked with in your career?

93
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,396
Well, I'm not sure.

94
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,480
Here you go.

95
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,111
When it reached a thousand,
I kind of stopped counting.

96
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:48,491
Impressive.
Do you remember each one of them?

97
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,577
No way.

98
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,579
-But...
-But what?

99
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,667
I can't remember every face and name...

100
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,919
but their scents,

101
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,090
their moans of ecstasy,
the shapes of their bodies...

102
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,134
I remember those details.

103
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,429
Sometimes I won't even remember
my co-stars

104
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,514
until I sense these details.

105
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,769
-I'm sorry.
-Did you spill it on your kimono?

106
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,605
My kimono's fine. I'm sorry.

107
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,149
Shall we go, then?

108
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,692
Sure.

109
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,612
Please pay the check with this.

110
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,032
-I'll walk you out.
-Don't worry.

111
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,243
-Master, thank you for the meal.
-Thanks for coming.

112
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,218
Come on, guys.

113
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,012
You drove them away
with that dirty talk.

114
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,932
Dirty? I was just talking
about Mr. Oki's career.

115
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,351
You disrespect Mr. Oki.

116
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,688
I'm sorry. I don't mean to.

117
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,939
It's all right.

118
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,234
A polite sex isn't fun at all.

119
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,631
Miku gave you the bouquet?
You're so lucky.

120
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,509
You can have it.

121
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,261
Are you sure?

122
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,097
I'm a big fan of Miku Yukino.

123
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,724
Here you go. Enjoy it.

124
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,769
What will she do now?

125
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,480
She's studying design in Paris.

126
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,649
Wow. That's impressive.

127
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:49,863
Many don't have a successful career
after quitting the adult movie industry.

128
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,656
So, I hope she makes it.

129
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,826
-What?
-Delicious.

130
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,327
Mr. Oki, this is for you.

131
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,463
What's wrong?

132
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,850
Are you okay, Mr. Oki?

133
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,227
Well...

134
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,776
Welcome.

135
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>What? Why?</i>

136
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,346
-Why the two of them?
-Let me explain.

137
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,681
"Do you remember me now?"

138
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,559
"I just didn't recognize you."
That's what they said.

139
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,978
What's that?
Did they know each other?

140
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,731
-Fujiko and Mr. Oki?
-I guess so.

141
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,609
Why didn't you ask them?

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,112
Of course we did. Right?

143
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,907
Well, everyone has something
they don't want to talk about.

144
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,408
What?

145
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,410
Are you saying...?

146
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,996
Am I right?

147
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,415
I got it. Adult movies.

148
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,340
When was that?

149
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,051
Twenty-three years ago.

150
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,178
It was a long time ago, huh?

151
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,642
I was actually quite surprised
that a first-time actress

152
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,185
would choose me as a co-star.

153
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,565
When did you marry?

154
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,901
Twenty-three years ago.

155
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,614
Does it mean
that you were engaged then?

156
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,701
Yes, I went to the shoot...

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,621
right after having had a fitting
for my wedding dress.

158
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,539
Really?

159
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,251
Does your husband know about that?

160
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,253
No.

161
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,007
He wouldn't have married me
if he had known

162
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,676
that I appeared in an adult movie,

163
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,803
no matter how much
he was in love with me.

164
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:27,061
Some see it as a marriage
for business reasons.

165
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,314
Mr. Hisamatsu helped
Fujiko's father's business,

166
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,149
which was on the verge
of bankruptcy,

167
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,318
in return for marrying Fujiko.

168
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,111
That's it.

169
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,406
She was forced
to marry someone she didn't love.

170
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,617
In desperation,
she became a porn star.

171
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,994
-That sounds about right.
-No, it doesn't.

172
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,288
They really care for each other.

173
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,999
They may now, but...

174
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,504
I'm sure she has other reasons.

175
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,225
I think Hisamatsu still suspects

176
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,312
that I married him

177
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,149
to gain financial assistance
for my father's business.

178
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,193
Is he right?

179
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,073
I can't deny the fact completely.

180
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,659
But that wasn't the only reason.

181
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,248
I was genuinely attracted to him.

182
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,376
It's...

183
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,336
true.

184
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,632
Then why do it?

185
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,220
I was...

186
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,973
a virgin.

187
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,896
Did you know that?

188
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,274
Yes. You were shy.

189
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,029
Being with a virgin is a bit too much,
right?

190
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,366
A virgin is very precious
in the adult movie industry.

191
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,245
Not only in the industry.

192
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,748
Many men regard a woman's virginity
with importance.

193
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,087
I thought that Hisamatsu was one of them.

194
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,839
But...

195
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,009
I felt that it wasn't fair.

196
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,514
It's hard to explain.

197
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,641
I didn't like it.

198
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,437
A virgin marries an older man
with experience.

199
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,025
He has women from the past
to remember.

200
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,193
But I didn't have anyone.

201
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,989
So, this is his second marriage?

202
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,535
He lost his first wife to cancer
a long time ago.

203
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,914
But still I don't understand why you dared
to be in an adult movie.

204
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,375
Didn't you have someone special
back then?

205
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,548
I...

206
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,719
fell in love at first sight...

207
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,600
when I saw you in a magazine.

208
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,899
With a single meeting,

209
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,153
I believed I could have the most
memorable experience of my life.

210
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,157
You were that special to me.

211
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,080
I still have...

212
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,292
your letter.

213
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,590
Do you want to answer it?

214
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,193
You should answer it.

215
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,713
Yes?

216
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,885
My husband?

217
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,053
Which hospital?

218
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,474
I'll be right there.

219
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:26,194
DEAR MR. OKI, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT WAS NOT JUST A JOB.

220
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,570
Is it a love letter?

221
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,740
It's a thank-you letter.

222
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,911
A long time ago, I got it
after we finished shooting a movie.

223
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,955
Really? A thank-you letter, huh?

224
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,374
What a polite girl.

225
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,878
It was her only movie.

226
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,672
She appeared once...

227
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,509
then disappeared.

228
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,601
Master, give me sake.

229
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,812
Welcome.

230
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,483
What, did someone die?

231
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,693
Mr. Hisamatsu.

232
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,404
He suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm.

233
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,373
<i>People finish their day</i>

234
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,458
<i>and hurry home.</i>

235
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,171
<i>But sometimes they don't want</i>
<i>to go straight back home.</i>

236
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,216
<i>So, they drop in somewhere else</i>
<i>on the way home.</i>

237
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,786
Do you remember...

238
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,623
what I said when we got married?

239
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,713
"From now on,
I want to live to make you happy."

240
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,007
Yes.

241
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,095
I still have... the same feeling.

242
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,559
You are still beautiful.

243
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,853
So very beautiful.

244
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,167
Welcome.

245
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,088
I'm so glad to see you.

246
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,426
I haven't heard from you.
I was starting to get worried.

247
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,390
-What a tragedy.
-Mr. Oki.

248
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,976
Would you spare some time for me?

249
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,729
Not now.

250
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,189
Tomorrow.

251
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,788
I found it while I was going
through his personal belongings.

252
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,091
Go ahead, see for yourself.

253
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,814
SECRET OF A HIGH-CLASS GIRL

254
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,779
All of them?

255
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,839
<i>"I cannot see you again.</i>

256
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,925
<i>I feel like he is always</i>
<i>watching over me."</i>

257
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>That's what Fujiko told him.</i>

258
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,514
Another order of hot sake.

259
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,766
Sorry.

260
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,977
You've already had three orders.

261
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,689
Here you go. Enjoy.

262
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,660
<i>I'm sorry to say,</i>
<i>but my wife's yam is better.</i>

263
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,081
"He spoils me."

264
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,836
Fujiko once said so...

265
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,756
about her husband.

266
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,433
There he is.

267
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,438
You're Erect Oki, right?

268
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,649
ERECT OKI VS. MILF

269
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,610
You co-starred with this girl.

270
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,238
This is her, right?

271
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,824
-She was our classmate.
-Don't you know her real name?

272
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,910
Ami. Her name is Ami.

273
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,911
Ami.

274
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,164
It's the same person, right?

275
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,042
So, what?

276
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,505
What would you do

277
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,590
if it is your friend?

278
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,641
How petty.

279
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,562
You are...

280
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,440
so petty.

281
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,406
<i>Add a pinch of salt to the olive oil.</i>

282
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,784
<i>Then sauté sliced yam in a pan</i>

283
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>and sprinkle on soy sauce at the end.</i>

284
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,375
The burned surface enhances the flavor.

285
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,627
Cook it until lightly browned.

286
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,379
Here you go.

287
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,173
Enjoy it.

288
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,758
It's an energy booster.

289
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,887
-After you.
-No. Please, you go first.

290
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,432
-No, no. After you.
-Please, go ahead.

291
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,360
Good night.

292
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,766
THIS STORY IS FICTION
