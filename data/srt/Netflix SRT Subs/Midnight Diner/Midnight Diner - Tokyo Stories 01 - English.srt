<i>When people finish their day</i>

2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>my day starts.</i>

3
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,272
<i>My diner is open from midnight</i>

4
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,985
<i>They call it "Midnight Diner."</i>

5
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,447
PORK MISO SOUP COMBO
BEER, SAKE, SHOCHU

6
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,948
<i>That's all I have on my menu.</i>

7
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,118
<i>But I make whatever customers request</i>

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,704
<i>as long as I have ingredients for it.</i>

9
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,623
<i>That's my policy.</i>

10
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>Do I even have customers?</i>
<i>More than you would expect.</i>

11
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,929
MIDNIGHT DINER:
TOKYO STORIES

12
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,808
TAN-MEN

13
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>I use instant dried noodles for ramen.</i>

14
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,378
<i>But for tan-men, I use fresh noodles.</i>

15
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>Fresh noodles are better suited</i>
<i>for tan-men.</i>

16
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,140
I feel guilty eating regular ramen at night.

17
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,810
But tan-men is good because
it comes with vegetables.

18
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,436
Here you go again.

19
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,691
If you're going to make excuses,
don't eat them to begin with.

20
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,611
It's like life. We can't make
rational choices all the time.

21
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,324
Be careful.
It's that extra bite that makes you fat.

22
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,621
<i>Mr. Shimada is a radio announcer.</i>

23
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:30,377
<i>I guess his doctor had told him</i>
<i>to watch his weight.</i>

24
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:34,965
Welcome.

25
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,383
Hi.

26
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,641
Tan-men, no noodles.

27
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,643
Got it.

28
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,444
Here you go. Without noodles.

29
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,154
Thank you.

30
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,546
Excuse me.

31
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,549
I've never heard of such a dish.

32
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,929
I don't want to have carbohydrates
late at night.

33
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,806
Besides,

34
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,892
noodles soak up the soup

35
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,728
and get thicker
while you eat the vegetables.

36
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,064
Well, that makes sense, but...

37
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,984
Master, cancel my order of rice with tea.

38
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,695
I will have tan-men without noodles,
just like her.

39
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,613
Sure.

40
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,201
Have you finished
your shift for the night?

41
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,372
Not yet. I will work until morning.

42
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,334
I'm so impressed by you.

43
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,252
I have no sense of direction.

44
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,297
Do you use a navigation system?

45
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,343
I know every street in Tokyo.

46
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,889
Without noodles, huh?

47
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>Mr. Shimada was so impressed that...</i>

48
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:11,770
MIDNIGHT SHIMA-CHAN

49
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,857
Hi Ms. Witch of Tabata,
I've also tried every method.

50
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,944
There's one called the Apple Diet.

51
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,154
Don't try it. It didn't fill me up at all.

52
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,284
So I switched to eating apple pies,
but then I got even fatter.

53
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,703
Moreover,
it all went straight to my gut.

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,626
Anyway, "without" at a soba noodle shop
means tempura soba without noodles.

55
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,795
Whenever I see someone
having that with a drink,

56
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,673
I know he's a real connoisseur.

57
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,008
<i>Recently I met someone</i>

58
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,513
<i>who ordered tan-men without noodles</i>
<i>at my favorite diner.</i>

59
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:52,686
<i>Tan-men without noodles</i>
<i>is basically hearty vegetable soup.</i>

60
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,856
<i>It would be a great meal</i>
<i>for someone who is watching their weight.</i>

61
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,236
Really? What a strange dish to order.

62
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,865
You're right about that.

63
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,325
<i>But I have not tried it yet.</i>

64
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,372
Was it about this diner?

65
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,458
That's right.
It was Mr. Shimada's radio show.

66
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,544
He talked about tan-men without noodles.

67
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,630
That was about Ms. Harumi, right?

68
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,883
-That's right.
-Who is she?

69
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,095
Don't you remember?
The female taxi driver.

70
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,806
That good-looking woman
who is past her prime?

71
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,183
Past her prime? How old is she?

72
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,019
My guess is...

73
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,230
-she is in her mid-forties.
-She is young enough for me then.

74
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,774
I wouldn't even call her mature.

75
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,070
I have a thing for women
with low metabolic rates.

76
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,656
I get a strong libido for such women.

77
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,909
You will live long.

78
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,954
Can I try tan-men without noodles?

79
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,582
-Me, too.
-Sure.

80
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,169
Can I? You look mellow.

81
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,755
-Here's one.
-Mellow?

82
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,174
-One more.
-Shut up.

83
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,847
<i>Two weeks later...</i>

84
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,356
I knew it. It was about me, huh?

85
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,485
I'm sorry for using your story
without your permission.

86
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,948
The way you were eating
made the dish look so tasty.

87
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,076
It reminded me of the good old days.

88
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,995
Once, I called into a radio show
to request a song,

89
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,664
and my name was mentioned.

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,874
You are a late-night-radio generation?

91
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,918
Now you know how old I am.

92
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,838
So, why a radio jockey?

93
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,426
I looked up to late-night radio jockeys.

94
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,388
When I got sad or stressed out,

95
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,640
and didn't know what to do,

96
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,018
they helped me feel like I wasn't alone.

97
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,772
I know what you mean.

98
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,114
Yes.

99
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,574
Sure.

100
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,244
I'm nearby.

101
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,663
I will pick you up in five minutes.

102
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,499
See you at the same spot.

103
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,835
See you soon.

104
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,340
Is that a regular customer?

105
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,718
Regular customers are great.

106
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,013
It's not always easy finding customers
just by driving around.

107
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,141
Master, check please.

108
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,812
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you.

109
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,410
Why does she looks so familiar to me?

110
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,497
Right?

111
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,959
Don't you think they look alike?
I have no doubt.

112
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,377
Crimson Maple.

113
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,631
They do look alike.

114
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,175
What is this anyway?

115
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,927
She's Crimson Maple.

116
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,930
From the legendary TV show,
<i>Super Ninja Squadron Koga.</i>

117
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:16,848
Do you know it?

118
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,143
No. There were too many
ninja squadron shows.

119
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,980
Black Flying Squirrel,

120
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,193
Ultramarine Gale, Light-green Yonezo,
Orange Tasuke,

121
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,944
and Crimson Maple.

122
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,826
Five super ninjas kill evildoers,
leaving no trace!

123
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,874
When I was a kid, I sent her a fan letter.

124
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,168
Then she sent me this photo.

125
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,130
I wonder if she remembers me.

126
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,804
Mr. Middle-aged Rider,

127
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,890
there is no age limit for falling in love.

128
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,226
But don't be a stalker.

129
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,394
Please consider
how your love interest feels.

130
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,939
Speaking of love...

131
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:11,820
I recently ran into my first love
at the most random place.

132
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,448
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was an unrequited love.</i>

133
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,118
<i>She doesn't even know who I am.</i>

134
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,914
<i>Some of you may remember a TV show</i>
<i>called </i>Super Ninja Squadron Koga,

135
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>which was popular when I was a kid.</i>

136
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,671
<i>One of the show's characters,</i>
<i>Crimson Maple,</i>

137
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,506
<i>is my first love.</i>

138
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,259
<i>When I realized</i>
<i>that she was Crimson Maple,</i>

139
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,886
<i>this song started playing in my head.</i>

140
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,808
<i>It's the main theme song</i>
<i>from </i>Super Ninja Squadron Koga.

141
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,357
That brings back so many memories.

142
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,860
Are you starting a fan club for that show?

143
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:52,777
That's right.

144
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,114
I announced it on my show's website
to see the listeners' reactions.

145
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,991
The feedback was amazing.

146
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,119
My favorite episode is when the leader
welcomed Maple,

147
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,871
who was a lone ninja, to their squadron.

148
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,789
-"If It Is Hidden, It Is The Flower."
-Yes!

149
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,499
Do you remember what Flying Squirrel said?

150
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,376
<i>"We got your back.</i>

151
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,253
<i>So don't run. Just fight."</i>

152
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,129
PLAYING NEXT WEEK?!

153
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,006
<i>Even as a kid,</i>
<i>I was so touched by that.</i>

154
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,465
I felt the same way.

155
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,051
And Flying Squirrel and...

156
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,845
Men...

157
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,263
never grow up.

158
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,640
Here you go.

159
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,476
Extra large pork and veggie soup combo.

160
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,187
Bon appétit.

161
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,440
Hey, guys.

162
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,026
It's great to show your support,

163
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,571
but have you thought about
how she would feel?

164
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,573
Don't you agree, Master?

165
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,824
Yeah...

166
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,703
I'm sure a lot has happened
that led her to where she is now.

167
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,666
And that's what I want her to
talk about on my show.

168
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,296
She's diligent, and loyal to her job.

169
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,257
I felt it when I met her here.
It's just a hunch, but...

170
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,803
I think she could even talk about
her downs positively.

171
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,473
That's right.
She must have moved on by now.

172
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,892
She is a good taxi driver now.

173
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,686
I'm sure her past is just
a fond memory now.

174
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,274
It's a fond memory for you,

175
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,276
but it's not for me.

176
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,614
I didn't even like the role to begin with.

177
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,243
No matter what I played after that,

178
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,869
I was labeled as Maple of Koga.

179
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,540
That's the main reason why I quit acting.

180
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,710
I didn't know that.

181
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,672
I've been through a lot to be here now.

182
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,008
Please don't expose my life
just for your own interest.

183
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,343
That wasn't my--

184
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,095
But...

185
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,972
I can see how it could come off that way.

186
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,974
I'm really sorry.

187
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,742
Master, another one.

188
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,834
What's the occasion?
You've never had a drink here.

189
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,255
Does Mr. Shimada still come here?

190
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,551
Speaking of... he hasn't in a while.

191
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:26,931
I...

192
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,518
can finally tell everyone with pride...

193
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,520
how much I love my current job.

194
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,024
Mr. Shimada said the same thing.

195
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,611
"She's diligent, and loyal to her job."

196
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,115
Is that right?

197
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,205
Master, "without noodles" please.

198
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,207
Sure.

199
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,851
Back then,
I was the worst actress in the group.

200
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,936
I didn't want to admit it.

201
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,856
So I put myself on a pedestal,

202
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,067
and took my stress out on others.

203
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,069
I was really awful.

204
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,826
But even then,
the leader always defended me.

205
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,373
What's the name of his character?

206
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,792
Flying Squirrel.

207
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,668
That's right.

208
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,882
Flying Squirrel was a good man, huh?

209
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,638
I loved with him.

210
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,642
But then...

211
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,481
Good morning.

212
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,613
<i>One day I went to the studio</i>
<i>earlier than usual.</i>

213
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,002
I...

214
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,506
Sorry.

215
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,180
This one is on me.

216
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,475
No, you really don't need to do that.

217
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,560
Please, let me.

218
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,230
<i>He wished he had been born a girl.</i>

219
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,232
<i>He confided in me about it.</i>

220
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,320
<i>Thanks to that,</i>
<i>I couldn't be in love with him,</i>

221
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,824
<i>but I got an indispensable friendship.</i>

222
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,496
Here you go.

223
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,209
We didn't have much money...

224
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,255
so we always had a drink with this dish.

225
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,846
I was afraid that old fans
might scrutinize his current life

226
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,848
if the radio show renewed their interest.

227
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,352
Since he protected me back then,

228
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,229
it was my turn to protect him now.

229
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,904
But it turned out
that it was none of my concern.

230
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,782
Did Flying Squirrel tell you that?

231
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,245
"Your life is your business.

232
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,789
And my life is mine.

233
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,876
We are walking on separate paths.

234
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,753
Leave it that way."

235
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,256
So... speaking of...

236
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,133
How is he doing now?

237
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,857
I'm the one who bothered her.

238
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,526
So why?

239
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,029
She feels that she has said too much.

240
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,823
So she wants to apologize to you.

241
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,787
Good evening.

242
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,288
Welcome.

243
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,384
Well...

244
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,387
I was ignorant and insensitive.

245
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,722
I am really sorry. I shouldn't have--

246
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,687
"We got your back.

247
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,188
So...

248
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,107
don't run. Just fight."

249
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:50,778
Harumi,

250
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,615
I will tell him everything myself.
You got that?

251
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,327
Whatever you want.
I'm leaving after my meal.

252
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,123
-You are so unsociable.
-I stopped meddling in others' affairs.

253
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,460
Don't you recognize me?

254
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,387
Crimson Maple and...

255
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,099
Crimson Maple and...

256
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,101
Flying Squirrel?

257
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,645
You are Flying Squirrel.

258
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,232
Really? Really?

259
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,110
-Flying--
-Want some water?

260
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,579
Flying Squirrel?

261
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,332
Get ready.

262
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,876
We're live,
so please watch your language.

263
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,504
The commercial break will end soon.

264
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,009
Shima, go.

265
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,888
This is "Midnight Shima-chan."

266
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,808
Believe it or not,
I have a special guest tonight.

267
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,062
To tell you the truth,
I didn't think that he would come.

268
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,688
Long time no see.

269
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,567
I'm Black Flying Squirrel
from <i>Super Ninja Squadron Koga.</i>

270
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,196
I'm so happy to hear
that everyone remembers me.

271
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,916
I'm the only one here today,
but get ready for our usual callout.

272
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
"When the five super ninjas unite,

273
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,587
they kill evildoers, leaving no trace!

274
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,131
When five bells ring,

275
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,342
time's up for the evildoers.

276
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,719
Koga will go anywhere

277
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,181
beyond good and evil!"

278
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,731
<i>Can you believe</i>
<i>today's show is almost over?</i>

279
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:56,112
<i>Flying Squirrel wants to send a message</i>
<i>to his dear friend.</i>

280
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,579
<i>I will send out a personal message</i>
<i>through the radio.</i>

281
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,836
<i>I love who I am, as well as who I was.</i>

282
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:19,051
No matter what others say about me,
I don't care. This is who I am.

283
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,973
<i>I may have a thicker skin now</i>
<i>than I had then...</i>

284
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,269
That said...

285
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,064
I appreciate the fact...

286
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,025
that you really care about me.

287
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,781
I want to thank you sincerely.

288
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,457
<i>Please come again, Flying Squirrel.</i>

289
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,709
<i>Until next week.</i>

290
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,627
<i>Good night, everyone.</i>

291
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,351
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

292
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,687
Where are you going?

293
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,637
Here you go.

294
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,684
I'm the sixth Super Ninja,
White Shima-chan.

295
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,854
My favorite item is "with noodles"
after all.

296
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,106
Hey rookie, no whispering.

297
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,319
Attention please, everyone.

299
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,571
Good night.

300
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:53,849
THIS STORY IS FICTION
